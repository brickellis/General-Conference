Throughout time even and especially during difficult times prophets have encouraged us to remember the greatness of God and to consider what He has done for us as individuals as families and as a people 1 This direction is found throughout the scriptures but is notably prominent in the Book of Mormon The title page explains that one of the Book of Mormon s purposes is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers 2 The Book of Mormon s conclusion includes Moroni s appeal Behold I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men and ponder it in your hearts 3The consistency of pleas from prophets to reflect on the goodness of God is striking 4 Our Heavenly Father wants us to recall His and His Beloved Son s goodness not for Their own gratification but for the influence such remembrance has on us By considering Their kindness our perspective and understanding are enlarged By reflecting on Their compassion we become more humble prayerful and steadfast A poignant experience with a former patient shows how gratitude for generosity and compassion can transform us In 1987 I became acquainted with Thomas Nielson a remarkable man who needed a heart transplant He was 63 years old and lived in Logan Utah in the United States Following military service during World War II he married Donna Wilkes in the Logan Utah Temple He became an energetic and successful brick mason In later years he especially enjoyed working with his oldest grandchild Jonathan during school vacations The two developed a special bond in part because Tom saw much of himself in Jonathan Tom found waiting for a donor heart frustrating He was not a particularly patient man He had always been able to set and achieve goals through hard work and sheer determination Struggling with heart failure with his life on hold Tom sometimes asked me what I was doing to speed up the process Jokingly he suggested avenues I could pursue that would make a donor heart available to him sooner One joyous yet dreadful day an ideal donor heart became available for Tom The size and blood type were a match and the donor was young just 16 years old The donor heart belonged to Jonathan Tom s beloved grandson Earlier that day Jonathan had been fatally injured when the car in which he was riding was struck by a passing train When I visited Tom and Donna in the hospital they were distraught It is hard to imagine what they were going through knowing that Tom s life could be extended by using their grandson s heart At first they refused to consider the proffered heart from Jonathan s grieving parents their daughter and son in law Tom and Donna knew though that Jonathan was brain dead and came to understand that their prayers for a donor heart for Tom had not caused Jonathan s accident No Jonathan s heart was a gift that could bless Tom in his time of need They recognized that something good might come out of this tragedy and decided to proceed The transplant procedures went well Afterward Tom was a different man The change went beyond improved health or even gratitude He told me that he reflected every morning on Jonathan on his daughter and son in law on the gift he had received and on what that gift had entailed Even though his innate good humor and grit were still readily apparent I observed that Tom was more solemn thoughtful and kindhearted Tom lived an additional 13 years after the transplant years he otherwise would not have had His obituary stated that these years allowed him to touch the lives of his family and others with generosity and love He was a private benefactor and an example of optimism and determination Much like Tom each of us has received gifts that we could not provide for ourselves gifts from our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son including redemption through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ 5 We have received life in this world we will receive physical life in the hereafter and eternal salvation and exaltation if we choose it all because of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Every time we use benefit from or even think of these gifts we ought to consider the sacrifice generosity and compassion of the givers Reverence for the givers does more than just make us grateful Reflecting on Their gifts can and should transform us One remarkable transformation was that of Alma the Younger As Alma was going about rebelling against God 6 an angel appeared With a voice of thunder 7 the angel chastised Alma for persecuting the Church and stealing away the hearts of the people 8 The angel added this admonition Go and remember the captivity of thy fathers and remember how great things God has done for them 9 Of all possible exhortations that was what the angel emphasized Alma repented and remembered He later shared the angel s admonition with his son Helaman Alma counseled I would that ye should do as I have done in remembering the captivity of our fathers for they were in bondage and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions 10 Alma said simply I do put my trust in him 11 Alma understood that by remembering deliverance from bondage and support during trials and troubles of every kind we come to know God and the surety of His promises 12Few of us have an experience as dramatic as Alma s yet our transformation can be equally profound The Savior pledged anciently A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart and I will give you an heart of flesh And I will put my spirit within you And ye shall be my people and I will be your God 13The resurrected Savior told the Nephites how this transformation begins He identified a pivotal feature in Heavenly Father s plan when He said And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross that I might draw all men unto me And for this cause have I been lifted up therefore according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me 14What does it take for you to be drawn to the Savior Consider Jesus Christ s submission to His Father s will His victory over death His taking upon Himself your sins and mistakes His receiving power from the Father to make intercession for you and His ultimate redemption of you 15 Are these things not sufficient to draw you to Him They are for me Jesus Christ stands with open arms hoping and willing to heal forgive cleanse strengthen purify and sanctify you and me 16These truths should give us a new heart and prompt us to choose to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Yet even new hearts may be prone to wander prone to leave the God we love 17 To fight this tendency we need to reflect every day on the gifts we have received and on what they entailed King Benjamin counseled I would that ye should remember and always retain in remembrance the greatness of God and his goodness and long suffering towards you 18 If we do so we qualify for remarkable heavenly blessings Reflecting on God s goodness and mercy helps us become more spiritually receptive In turn increased spiritual sensitivity allows us to come to know the truth of all things by the power of the Holy Ghost 19 This includes a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon knowing that Jesus is the Christ our personal Savior and Redeemer and accepting that His gospel has been restored in these latter days 20When we remember the greatness of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and what They have done for us we will not take Them for granted just as Tom did not take Jonathan s heart for granted In a joyful and reverent way Tom remembered each day the tragedy that brought him extended life In the exuberance of knowing that we can be saved and exalted we need to remember that salvation and exaltation came at a great cost 21 We can be reverently joyful as we realize that without Jesus Christ we are doomed but with Him we can receive the greatest gift Heavenly Father can give 22 Indeed this reverence allows us to enjoy the promise of eternal life in this world and eventually receive eternal life even immortal glory in the world to come 23When we consider the goodness of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ our trust in Them increases Our prayers change because we know God is our Father and we are His children We seek not to change His will but to align our will with His and secure for ourselves blessings that He wants to grant conditioned on our asking for them 24 We yearn to be more meek more pure more steadfast more Christlike 25 These changes qualify us for additional heavenly blessings By acknowledging that every good thing comes from Jesus Christ we will communicate our faith more effectively to others 26 We will have courage when confronted with seemingly impossible tasks and circumstances 27 We will strengthen our resolve to keep the covenants we have made to follow the Savior 28 We will be filled with the love of God want to help those in need without being judgmental love our children and raise them in righteousness retain a remission of our sins and always rejoice 29 These are the remarkable fruits of remembering God s goodness and mercy In contrast the Savior warned In nothing doth man offend God or against none is his wrath kindled save those who confess not his hand in all things 30 I do not think that God is insulted when we forget Him Rather I think He is deeply disappointed He knows that we have deprived ourselves of the opportunity to draw closer to Him by remembering Him and His goodness We then miss out on Him drawing nearer to us and the specific blessings He has promised 31I invite you to remember each day the greatness of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and what They have done for you Let your consideration of Their goodness more firmly bind your wandering heart to Them 32 Ponder Their compassion and you will be blessed with added spiritual sensitivity and become more Christlike Contemplating Their empathy will help you hold out faithful to the end until you are received into heaven to dwell with God in a state of never ending happiness 33Our Heavenly Father referring to His Beloved Son said Hear Him 34 As you act on those words and listen to Him remember joyfully and reverently that the Savior loves to restore what you cannot restore He loves to heal wounds you cannot heal He loves to fix what has been irreparably broken 35 He compensates for any unfairness inflicted on you 36 and He loves to permanently mend even shattered hearts 37As I have reflected on gifts from our Heavenly Father and from Jesus Christ I have come to know of Their infinite love and Their incomprehensible compassion for all Heavenly Father s children 38 This knowledge has changed me and it will change you too In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Last April I had the privilege of dedicating the Kinshasa Democratic Republic of the Congo Temple 1 Words cannot express the joy the faithful Congolese and I felt to see a temple dedicated in their land Individuals who enter the Kinshasa Temple see an original painting entitled Congo Falls 2 It uniquely reminds temple goers of the unwavering commitment required to anchor themselves to Jesus Christ and to follow the covenant path of our Heavenly Father s plan The waterfalls depicted in the painting call to mind a practice that was common more than a century ago among early converts to Christianity in Congo Before their conversion they worshipped inanimate objects believing that the items possessed supernatural powers 3 After conversion many made a pilgrimage to one of the countless waterfalls along the Congo River such as the Nzongo Falls 4 These converts threw their previously idolized objects into the waterfalls as a symbol to God and others that they had discarded their old traditions and accepted Jesus Christ They intentionally did not throw their objects into calm shallow waters they threw them into the churning waters of a massive waterfall where the items became unrecoverable These actions were a token of a new but unwavering commitment to Jesus Christ People in other places and ages demonstrated their commitment to Jesus Christ in similar ways 5 The Book of Mormon people known as the Anti Nephi Lehies laid down the weapons of their rebellion burying them deep in the earth as a testimony to God that they never would use their weapons again 6 In doing so they promised to follow God s teachings and never go back on their commitment This action was the beginning of being converted unto the Lord and never falling away 7Being converted unto the Lord means leaving one course of action directed by an old belief system and adopting a new one based on faith in Heavenly Father s plan and in Jesus Christ and His Atonement This change is more than an intellectual acceptance of gospel teachings It shapes our identity transforms our understanding of life s meaning and leads to unchanging fidelity to God Personal desires that are contrary to being anchored to the Savior and to following the covenant path fade away and are replaced by a determination to submit to the will of Heavenly Father Being converted unto the Lord starts with an unwavering commitment to God followed by making that commitment part of who we are Internalizing such a commitment is a lifelong process that requires patience and ongoing repentance Eventually this commitment becomes part of who we are embedded in our sense of self and ever present in our lives Just as we never forget our own name no matter what else we are thinking about we never forget a commitment that is etched in our hearts 8God invites us to cast our old ways completely out of reach and begin a new life in Christ This happens as we develop faith in the Savior which begins by hearing the testimony of those who have faith 9 Thereafter faith deepens as we act in ways that anchor us more firmly to Him 10Now it would be nice if increased faith were transmitted like the flu or the common cold Then a simple spiritual sneeze would build faith in others But it does not work that way The only way faith grows is for an individual to act in faith These actions are often prompted by invitations extended by others but we cannot grow someone else s faith or rely solely on others to bolster our own For our faith to grow we must choose faith building actions such as praying studying the scriptures partaking of the sacrament keeping the commandments and serving others As our faith in Jesus Christ grows God invites us to make promises with Him These covenants as such promises are known are manifestations of our conversion Covenants also create a sure foundation for spiritual progression As we choose to be baptized we begin to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ11 and choose to identify ourselves with Him We pledge to become like Him and to develop His attributes Covenants anchor us to the Savior and propel us along the path that leads to our heavenly home The power of covenants helps us maintain the mighty change of heart deepen our conversion to the Lord and receive Christ s image more fully in our countenance 12 But a half hearted commitment to our covenants will not guarantee us anything 13 We may be tempted to equivocate throw our old ways in calm water or bury our weapons of rebellion with the handles sticking out But an ambivalent commitment to our covenants will not open the door to the sanctifying power of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Our commitment to keep our covenants should not be conditional or vary with changing circumstances in our lives Our constancy to God should be like the dependable Congo River that flows near the Kinshasa Temple This river unlike most rivers in the world has constant flow all year14 and pours nearly 11 million gallons 41 5 million L of water per second into the Atlantic Ocean The Savior invited His disciples to be this dependable and steadfast He said Wherefore settle this in your hearts that ye will do the things which I shall teach and command you 15 A settled determination to keep our covenants allows for the full realization of God s promise of enduring joy 16Many faithful Latter day Saints have demonstrated that they are settled in keeping their covenants with God and are forever changed Let me tell you about three such individuals Brother Banza Mucioko Sister Banza R gine and Brother Mbuyi Nkitabungi In 1977 the Banzas lived in Kinshasa in the country of Zaire now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo They were highly respected in their Protestant church community Because of their talents their church arranged for their young family to go to Switzerland to study and provided a university scholarship While in Geneva on the bus route to school Brother Banza frequently saw a small meetinghouse with the name The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints He wondered Does Jesus Christ have Saints now in the latter days He eventually decided to go and see Brother and Sister Banza were greeted warmly at the branch They asked some of the persistent questions they had about the nature of God such as If God is a spirit like the wind how could we be created in His likeness How could He sit on a throne They had never received a satisfactory answer until the missionaries explained restored doctrine in a brief lesson When the missionaries left the Banzas looked at each other and said Isn t this the truth that we have heard They continued coming to church and meeting with the missionaries They knew that baptism in the restored Church of Jesus Christ would have consequences They would be stripped of their scholarships their visas would be revoked and they and their two young children would be required to leave Switzerland They chose to be baptized and confirmed in October 1979 Two weeks after their baptism Brother and Sister Banza returned to Kinshasa as the first and second members of the Church in their country The members of the Geneva Branch stayed in contact with them and helped them connect with Church leaders The Banzas were encouraged to faithfully await the promised time when God would establish His Church in Zaire Meanwhile another exchange student from Zaire Brother Mbuyi was studying in Belgium He was baptized in 1980 in the Brussels Ward Soon thereafter he served a full time mission to England And God worked His miracles Brother Mbuyi returned to Zaire as the third member of the Church in his country With parental permission Church meetings were held in his family home In February 1986 a petition was made for official government recognition of the Church The signatures of three citizens of Zaire were required The three happy signatories of the petition were Brother Banza Sister Banza and Brother Mbuyi These stalwart members knew the truth when they heard it they made a covenant at baptism that anchored them to the Savior They metaphorically threw their old ways into a churning waterfall with no intention of retrieving them The covenant path was never easy Political turmoil infrequent contact with Church leaders and challenges inherent in building a community of Saints might have deterred less committed individuals But Brother and Sister Banza and Brother Mbuyi persevered in their faith They were present at the dedication of the Kinshasa Temple 33 years after they signed the petition that led to the official recognition of the Church in Zaire The Banzas are here in the Conference Center today They are accompanied by their two sons Junior and Phil and daughters in law Annie and Youyou In 1986 Junior and Phil were the first two individuals baptized into the Church in Zaire Brother Mbuyi is watching these proceedings from Kinshasa with his wife Maguy and their five children These pioneers understand the meaning and consequences of covenants through which they have been brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer 17How do we anchor ourselves to the Savior and remain faithful like these and many tens of thousands of Congolese Saints who followed them and millions of others throughout the world The Savior taught us how Each week we partake of the sacrament and make a covenant with our Heavenly Father We promise to link our identity with the Savior s by pledging our willingness to take upon us His name to always remember Him and to keep His commandments 18 Conscientiously preparing for and worthily making these covenants each week anchors us to the Savior helps us internalize our commitment 19 and powerfully propels us along the covenant path I invite you to commit to a lifelong process of discipleship Make and keep covenants Throw your old ways into deep churning waterfalls Completely bury your weapons of rebellion with no handles sticking out Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ making covenants with a real intent to reliably honor them will bless your life forever You will become more like the Savior as you always remember Him follow Him and adore Him I testify that He is the firm foundation He is dependable and His promises are sure In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ desire to bless each of us 1 The question of how to access and obtain those blessings has been the subject of theological debate and discussion for centuries 2 Some contend that blessings are completely earned we receive them only through our works Others argue that God has already chosen who He will bless and how and that these determinations are unchangeable Both positions are fundamentally flawed Blessings from heaven are neither earned by frenetically accruing good deed coupons nor by helplessly waiting to see if we win the blessing lottery No the truth is much more nuanced but more appropriate for the relationship between a loving Heavenly Father and His potential heirs us Restored truth reveals that blessings are never earned but faith inspired actions on our part both initial and ongoing are essential 3As we consider how we receive blessings from God let us liken heavenly blessings to a massive pile of wood Imagine at the center a small mound of kindling topped by a layer of wood chips Sticks come next then small logs and finally huge logs This woodpile contains an enormous amount of fuel capable of producing light and heat for days Envision next to the woodpile a single match the kind with a phosphorus tip 4For the energy in the woodpile to be released the match needs to be struck and the kindling lit The kindling will quickly catch fire and cause the larger pieces of wood to burn Once this combustion reaction starts it continues until all the wood is burned or the fire is deprived of oxygen Striking the match and lighting the kindling are small actions that enable the potential energy of the wood to be released 5 Until the match is struck nothing happens regardless of the size of the woodpile If the match is struck but not applied to the kindling the amount of light and heat released from the match alone is miniscule and the combustion energy in the wood remains unreleased If oxygen is not supplied at any point the combustion reaction stops In a similar way most blessings that God desires to give us require action on our part action based on our faith in Jesus Christ Faith in the Savior is a principle of action and of power 6 First we act in faith then the power comes according to God s will and timing The sequence is crucial 7 The required action though is always tiny when compared to the blessings we ultimately receive 8Consider what happened when fiery flying serpents came among the ancient Israelites on their way to the promised land The bite of a poisonous serpent was fatal But a bitten individual could be healed by looking at a brass serpent fashioned by Moses and placed on a pole 9 How much energy does it take to look at something All who looked accessed the powers of heaven and were healed Other Israelites who were bitten failed to look at the brazen serpent and died Perhaps they lacked the faith to look 10 Perhaps they did not believe that such a simple action could trigger the promised healing Or perhaps they willfully hardened their hearts and rejected the counsel of God s prophet 11The principle of activating blessings that flow from God is eternal Like those ancient Israelites we too must act on our faith in Jesus Christ to be blessed God has revealed that there is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world upon which all blessings are predicated and when we obtain any blessing from God it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated 12 That being said you do not earn a blessing that notion is false but you do have to qualify for it Our salvation comes only through the merits and grace of Jesus Christ 13 The immensity of His atoning sacrifice means that the woodpile is infinite our puny actions approach zero in comparison But they are not zero and they are not insignificant in the dark a match that is lit can be seen for miles In fact it can be seen in heaven because small acts of faith are required to ignite God s promises 14To receive a desired blessing from God act with faith striking the metaphorical match on which the heavenly blessing is contingent For example one of the objects of prayer is to secure blessings that God is willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking 15 Alma cried out for mercy and his pains resolved he was no longer harrowed up by the memory of his sins His joy overwhelmed his pain all because he cried out with faith in Jesus Christ 16 The activation energy needed for us is to have enough faith in Christ to sincerely ask God in prayer and accept His will and timing for the answer Often the activation energy needed for blessings requires more than just looking or asking ongoing repeated faith filled actions are required In the middle of the 19th century Brigham Young directed a group of Latter day Saints to explore and settle Arizona an arid region in North America After reaching Arizona the group ran out of water and feared they would perish They pled with God for help Soon rain and snow fell allowing them to fill their barrels with water and provide for their livestock Grateful and refreshed they returned to Salt Lake City rejoicing in the goodness of God Upon their return they reported the details of their expedition to Brigham Young and pronounced their conclusion that Arizona was uninhabitable After listening to the report Brigham Young asked a man in the room what he thought about the expedition and the miracle That man Daniel W Jones tersely replied I would have filled up went on and prayed again Brother Brigham put his hand on Brother Jones and said This is the man that shall take charge of the next trip to Arizona 17We can all recall times when we have pushed on and prayed again and blessings resulted The experiences of Michael and Marian Holmes illustrate these principles Michael and I served together as Area Seventies I was always thrilled whenever he was called on to pray in our meetings because his deep spirituality was readily apparent he knew how to speak with God I loved to hear him pray Early in their marriage though Michael and Marian were not praying or attending church They were busy with three little children and a successful construction company Michael did not feel that he was a religious man One evening their bishop came to their home and encouraged them to begin praying After the bishop left Michael and Marian decided that they would try to pray Before going to bed they knelt at their bedside and uncomfortably Michael began After a few awkward words of prayer Michael abruptly stopped saying Marian I can t do this As he stood and began walking away Marian grabbed him by the hand dragged him back to his knees and said Mike you can do this Try again With this encouragement Michael finished a short prayer The Holmeses began to pray regularly They accepted a neighbor s invitation to attend church As they walked into the chapel and heard the opening hymn the Spirit whispered to them This is true Later unseen and unasked Michael helped haul some trash from the meetinghouse As he did he felt a distinct impression This is My house Michael and Marian accepted Church callings and served in their ward and stake They were sealed to each other and their 3 children were sealed to them More children followed bringing the total to 12 The Holmeses served as mission president and companion twice The first clunky prayer was a small but faith filled action that triggered the blessings of heaven The Holmeses fed the flames of faith by attending church and serving Their dedicated discipleship over the years has led to a raging inferno that inspires to this day A fire however must receive a constant supply of oxygen for the wood to ultimately release its full potential As demonstrated by Michael and Marian Holmes faith in Christ requires ongoing action for the blaze to continue Small actions fuel our ability to walk along the covenant path and lead to the greatest blessings God can offer But oxygen flows only if we figuratively keep moving our feet Sometimes we need to make a bow and arrow before revelation comes as to where we should search for food 18 Sometimes we need to make tools before revelations come as to how to build a ship 19 Sometimes at the direction of the Lord s prophet we need to bake a small cake from the little oil and flour we have to receive an unfailing cruse of oil and barrel of flour 20 And sometimes we need to be still and know that God is God and trust in His timing 21When you receive any blessing from God you can conclude that you have complied with an eternal law governing reception of that blessing 22 But remember that the irrevocably decreed law is time insensitive meaning blessings come on God s timetable Even ancient prophets in search of their heavenly home23 died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded and embraced them 24 If a desired blessing from God has not been received yet you do not need to go crazy wondering what more you need to do Instead heed Joseph Smith s counsel to cheerfully do all things that lie in your power and then stand still with the utmost assurance to see the arm of God revealed 25 Some blessings are reserved for later even for the most valiant of God s children 26Six months ago a home centered Church supported plan to learn doctrine strengthen faith and fortify individuals and families was introduced President Russell M Nelson promised that the changes can help us survive spiritually increase our gospel joy and deepen our conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ 27 But it is up to us to claim these blessings We are each responsible to open and study Come Follow Me For Individuals and Families along with the scriptures and other Come Follow Me material 28 We need to discuss them with our family and friends and organize our Sabbath day to light a metaphorical fire Or we can leave the resources sitting in a pile in our homes with the potential energy trapped inside I invite you to faithfully activate heavenly power to receive specific blessings from God Exercise the faith to strike the match and light the fire Supply the needed oxygen while you patiently wait on the Lord With these invitations I pray that the Holy Ghost will guide and direct you so that you like the faithful person described in Proverbs will abound with blessings 29 I testify that your Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ live are concerned with your welfare and delight to bless you in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The fictional character Mary Poppins is a typical English nanny who happens to be magical 1 She blows in on the east wind to help the troubled Banks family of Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane in Edwardian London She is given charge of the children Jane and Michael In a firm but kind manner she begins to teach them valuable lessons with an enchanting touch Jane and Michael make considerable progress but Mary decides that it is time for her to move on In the stage production Mary s chimney sweep friend Bert tries to dissuade her from leaving He argues But they re good kids Mary Mary replies Would I be bothering with them if they weren t But I can t help them if they won t let me and there s no one so hard to teach as the child who knows everything Bert asks So Mary answers So they ve got to do the next bit on their own 2Brothers and sisters like Jane and Michael Banks we are good kids who are worth bothering about Our Heavenly Father wants to help and bless us but we do not always let Him Sometimes we even act as if we already know everything And we too need to do the next bit on our own That is why we came to earth from a premortal heavenly home Our bit involves making choices Our Heavenly Father s goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him If He simply wanted us to be obedient He would use immediate rewards and punishments to influence our behaviors But God is not interested in His children just becoming trained and obedient pets who will not chew on His slippers in the celestial living room 3 No God wants His children to grow up spiritually and join Him in the family business God established a plan whereby we can become heirs in His kingdom a covenant path that leads us to become like Him have the kind of life He has and live forever as families in His presence 4 Personal choice was and is vital to this plan which we learned about in our premortal existence We accepted the plan and chose to come to earth To ensure that we would exercise faith and learn to use our agency properly a veil of forgetfulness was drawn over our minds so we would not remember God s plan Without that veil God s purposes would not be achieved because we could not progress and become the trusted inheritors He wants us to be The prophet Lehi said Wherefore the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself Wherefore man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other 5 At a fundamental level one option is represented by Jesus Christ the Firstborn of the Father The other option is represented by Satan Lucifer who wants to destroy agency and usurp power 6In Jesus Christ we have an advocate with the Father 7 After completing His atoning sacrifice Jesus ascended into heaven to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men And having claimed the rights of mercy he advocateth the cause of the children of men 8Christ s advocacy with the Father in our behalf is not adversarial Jesus Christ who allowed His will to be swallowed up in the will of the Father 9 would not champion anything other than what the Father has wanted all along Heavenly Father undoubtedly cheers for and applauds our successes Christ s advocacy is at least in part to remind us that He has paid for our sins and that no one is excluded from the reach of God s mercy 10 For those who believe in Jesus Christ repent are baptized and endure to the end a process that leads to reconciliation11 the Savior forgives heals and advocates He is our helper consoler and intercessor attesting to and vouching for our reconciliation with God 12In stark contrast Lucifer is an accuser or prosecutor John the Revelator described Lucifer s ultimate defeat And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven Now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ Why Because the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony 13Lucifer is this accuser He spoke against us in the premortal existence and he continues to denounce us in this life He seeks to drag us down He wants us to experience endless woe He is the one who tells us we are not adequate the one who tells us we are not good enough the one who tells us there is no recovery from a mistake He is the ultimate bully the one who kicks us when we are down If Lucifer were teaching a child to walk and the child stumbled he would scream at the child punish him and tell him to quit trying Lucifer s ways bring discouragement and despair eventually and always This father of lies is the ultimate purveyor of falsehood14 and cunningly works to deceive and distract us for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself 15If Christ were teaching a child to walk and the child stumbled He would help the child get up and encourage the next steps 16 Christ is the helper and consoler His ways bring joy and hope eventually and always God s plan includes directions for us referred to in the scriptures as commandments These commandments are neither a whimsical set nor an arbitrary collection of imposed rules meant only to train us to be obedient They are linked to our developing the attributes of godliness returning to our Heavenly Father and receiving enduring joy Obedience to His commandments is not blind we knowingly choose God and His pathway home The pattern for us is the same as it was for Adam and Eve wherein God gave unto them commandments after having made known unto them the plan of redemption 17 Though God wants us to be on the covenant path He gives us the dignity of choosing Indeed God desires expects and directs that each of His children choose for himself or herself He will not force us Through the gift of agency God permits His children to act for themselves and not to be acted upon 18 Agency allows us to choose to get on the path or not It allows us to get off or not Just as we cannot be forced to obey we cannot be forced to disobey No one can without our cooperation take us off the path Now this is not to be confused with those whose agency is violated They are not off the path they are victims They receive God s understanding love and compassion But when we get off the path God is saddened because He knows that this eventually but invariably leads to diminished happiness and forfeited blessings In the scriptures getting off the path is referred to as sin and the resultant decrease in happiness and forfeited blessings is called punishment In this sense God is not punishing us punishment is a consequence of our own choices not His When we discover that we are off the path we can stay off or because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can choose to reverse our steps and get back on In the scriptures the process of deciding to change and return to the path is referred to as repentance Failure to repent means that we choose to disqualify ourselves from the blessings God desires to give If we are not willing to enjoy that which we might have received we will return to our own place to enjoy that which we are willing to receive 19 our choice not God s No matter how long we have been off the path or how far away we have wandered the moment we decide to change God helps us return 20 From God s perspective through sincere repentance and pressing forward with a steadfastness in Christ once back on the path it will be as if we were never off 21 The Savior pays for our sins and frees us from the looming decrease in happiness and blessings This is referred to in the scriptures as forgiveness After baptism all members slip off the path some of us even dive off Therefore exercising faith in Jesus Christ repenting receiving help from Him and being forgiven are not onetime events but lifelong processes processes that are repetitive and iterative This is how we endure to the end 22We need to choose whom we will serve 23 The magnitude of our eternal happiness depends on choosing the living God and joining Him in His work As we strive to do the next bit on our own we practice using our agency correctly As two former Relief Society General Presidents said we should not be babies that need petting and correction all the time 24 No God wants us to become mature adults and govern ourselves Choosing to follow the Father s plan is the only way we can become inheritors in His kingdom only then can He trust us to not even ask for that which is contrary to His will 25 But we need to remember that there s no one so hard to teach as the child who knows everything So we need to be willing to be tutored in the Lord s ways by the Lord and His servants We can trust that we are beloved children of Heavenly Parents26 and worth bothering about and be assured that on our own will never mean alone As the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob said I say with him Therefore cheer up your hearts and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life Wherefore my beloved brethren and sisters reconcile yourselves to the will of God and not to the will of the devil and remember after ye are reconciled unto God that it is only in and through the grace of God that ye are saved 27So choose faith in Christ choose repentance choose to be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost choose to conscientiously prepare for and worthily partake of the sacrament choose to make covenants in the temple and choose to serve the living God and His children Our choices determine who we are and who we will become I conclude with the rest of Jacob s blessing Wherefore may God raise you from everlasting death by the power of the atonement that ye may be received into the eternal kingdom of God 28 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Family relationships can be some of the most rewarding yet challenging experiences we encounter Many of us have faced a fracture of some sort within our families Such a fracture developed between two heroes of the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ in these latter days Parley and Orson Pratt were brothers early converts and ordained Apostles Each faced a trial of faith but came through with an unshakable testimony Both sacrificed and contributed greatly for the cause of truth During the Nauvoo era their relationship became strained culminating in a heated public confrontation in 1846 A deep and prolonged rift developed Parley initially wrote to Orson to resolve the rift but Orson did not reply Parley gave up feeling that correspondence was over forever unless initiated by Orson 1Several years later in March 1853 Orson learned about a project to publish a book on the descendants of William Pratt the brothers earliest American ancestor Orson began to weep like a little child as he glimpsed this treasure trove of family history His heart melted and he determined to repair the breach with his brother Orson wrote to Parley Now my dear brother there are none among all the descendants of our Ancestor Lieut enant William Pratt who have so deep an interest in searching out his descendants as ourselves Orson was one of the first to understand that Latter day Saints have an obligation to research and compile family histories so that we can perform vicarious ordinances for our ancestors His letter continued We know that the God of our fathers has had a hand in all this I will beg pardon for having been so backward in writing to you I hope you will forgive me 2 Despite their unshakable testimonies their love for their ancestors was the catalyst to heal a rift mend a hurt and seek and extend forgiveness 3When God directs us to do one thing He often has many purposes in mind Family history and temple work is not only for the dead but blesses the living as well For Orson and Parley it turned their hearts to each other Family history and temple work provided the power to heal that which needed healing As Church members we do have a divinely appointed responsibility to seek out our ancestors and compile family histories This is far more than an encouraged hobby because the ordinances of salvation are necessary for all of God s children 4 We are to identify our own ancestors who died without receiving the ordinances of salvation We can perform the ordinances vicariously in temples and our ancestors may choose to accept the ordinances 5 We are also encouraged to help ward and stake members with their family names It is breathtakingly amazing that through family history and temple work we can help to redeem the dead But as we participate in family history and temple work today we also lay claim to healing blessings promised by prophets and apostles 6 These blessings are also breathtakingly amazing because of their scope specificity and consequence in mortality This long list includes these blessings Increased understanding of the Savior and His atoning sacrifice Increased influence of the Holy Ghost7 to feel strength and direction for our own lives Increased faith so that conversion to the Savior becomes deep and abiding Increased ability and motivation to learn and repent8 because of an understanding of who we are where we come from and a clearer vision of where we are going Increased refining sanctifying and moderating influences in our hearts Increased joy through an increased ability to feel the love of the Lord Increased family blessings no matter our current past or future family situation or how imperfect our family tree may be Increased love and appreciation for ancestors and living relatives so we no longer feel alone Increased power to discern that which needs healing and thus with the Lord s help serve others Increased protection from temptations and the intensifying influence of the adversary andIncreased assistance to mend troubled broken or anxious hearts and make the wounded whole 9If you have prayed for any of these blessings participate in family history and temple work As you do so your prayers will be answered When ordinances are performed on behalf of the deceased God s children on earth are healed No wonder President Russell M Nelson in his first message as President of the Church declared Your worship in the temple and your service there for your ancestors will bless you with increased personal revelation and peace and will fortify your commitment to stay on the covenant path 10An earlier prophet also foresaw blessings for both the living and the dead 11 A heavenly messenger showed Ezekiel a vision of a temple with water gushing out of it Ezekiel was told These waters issue out and go down into the desert and go into the dead sea and the waters shall be healed And it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live for they shall be healed and every thing shall live whither the river cometh 12Two characteristics of the water are noteworthy First though the small stream had no tributaries it grew into a mighty river becoming wider and deeper the farther it flowed Something similar happens with the blessings that flow from the temple as individuals are sealed as families Meaningful growth occurs going backward and forward through the generations as sealing ordinances weld families together Second the river renewed everything that it touched The blessings of the temple likewise have a stunning capacity to heal Temple blessings can heal hearts and lives and families Let me illustrate In 1999 a young man named Todd collapsed from a ruptured blood vessel in his brain Although Todd and his family were members of the Church their activity had been sporadic and none had experienced the blessings of the temple On the last night of Todd s life his mother Betty sat at his bedside stroking his hand and said Todd if you really do have to go I promise I ll see to it that your temple work gets done The next morning Todd was declared brain dead Surgeons transplanted Todd s heart into my patient a remarkable individual named Rod A few months after the transplant Rod learned the identity of his heart donor s family and began to correspond with them About two years later Todd s mother Betty invited Rod to be present when she went to the temple for the first time Rod and Betty first met in person in the celestial room of the St George Utah Temple Sometime thereafter Todd s father Betty s husband died A couple of years later Betty invited Rod to vicariously represent her deceased son in receiving his temple ordinances Rod gratefully did so and the proxy work culminated in a sealing room in the St George Utah Temple Betty was sealed to her deceased husband kneeling across the altar from her grandson who served as proxy Then with tears streaming down her cheeks she beckoned for Rod to join them at the altar Rod knelt beside them acting as proxy for her son Todd whose heart was still beating inside Rod s chest Rod s heart donor Todd was then sealed to his parents for all eternity Todd s mother had kept the promise she made to her dying son years before But the story does not end there Fifteen years after his heart transplant Rod became engaged to be married and asked me to perform the sealing in the Provo Utah Temple On the wedding day I met with Rod and his marvelous bride Kim in a room adjacent to the sealing room where their families and closest friends were waiting After briefly visiting with Rod and Kim I asked if they had any questions Rod said Yes My donor family is here and would love to meet you I was caught off guard and asked You mean they re here Right now Rod replied Yes I stepped around the corner and called the family out of the sealing room Betty her daughter and her son in law joined us Rod greeted Betty with a hug thanked her for coming and then introduced me to her Rod said Betty this is Elder Renlund He was the doctor who took care of your son s heart for so many years She crossed the room and embraced me And for the next several minutes there were hugs and tears of joy all around After we regained our composure we moved into the sealing room where Rod and Kim were sealed for time and all eternity Rod Kim Betty and I can testify that heaven was very close that there were others with us that day who had previously passed through the veil of mortality God in His infinite capacity seals and heals individuals and families despite tragedy loss and hardship We sometimes compare the feelings we experience in temples as having caught a glimpse of heaven 13 That day in the Provo Utah Temple this statement by C S Lewis resonated with me Mortals say of some temporal suffering No future bliss can make up for it not knowing that Heaven once attained will work backwards and turn even that agony into a glory The Blessed will say We have never lived anywhere except in Heaven 14God will strengthen help and uphold us 15 and He will sanctify to us our deepest distress 16 When we gather our family histories and go to the temple on behalf of our ancestors God fulfills many of these promised blessings simultaneously on both sides of the veil Similarly we are blessed when we help others in our wards and stakes do the same Members who do not live close to a temple also receive these blessings by participating in family history work collecting the names of their ancestors for temple ordinances to be performed President Russell M Nelson however cautioned We can be inspired all day long about temple and family history experiences others have had But we must do something to actually experience the joy ourselves He continued I invite you to prayerfully consider what kind of sacrifice preferably a sacrifice of time you can make to do more temple and family history work 17 As you accept President Nelson s invitation you will discover gather and connect your family Additionally blessings will flow to you and your family like the river spoken of by Ezekiel You will find healing for that which needs healing Orson and Parley Pratt experienced the healing and sealing effects of family history and temple work early in this dispensation Betty her family and Rod experienced it You can too Through His atoning sacrifice Jesus Christ offers these blessings to all both the dead and the living Because of these blessings we will find that we metaphorically have never lived anywhere except Heaven 18 I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Picture with me a rocket being maneuvered to a launchpad so it can be readied for liftoff Now visualize the ignition Fuel in a controlled burn is converted into hot gas that spews out providing the necessary thrust to propel the rocket into space Finally envision the payload or cargo that sits atop the rocket The payload s worth is fully realized only when it gets where it needs to be and functions as it should You don t need to be a rocket scientist to appreciate that an expensive global communications satellite is of little value sitting in a warehouse The rocket s mission is simply to deliver a payload This evening I would like to compare the priesthood that we hold to a rocket and the opportunity to benefit from the Savior s atoning power to the payload that a rocket delivers Because of His atoning sacrifice Jesus Christ has the power and authority to redeem all mankind To make His atoning power accessible He has delegated a portion of His power and authority to men on earth This delegated power and authority is called priesthood It permits priesthood holders to help Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in Their work to bring about the salvation and exaltation of God s children It does so because it provides His children the opportunity to receive the blessings of the Savior s atoning power The atoning power of Jesus Christ is essential because none of us can return to our heavenly home without help In mortality we invariably make mistakes and violate God s laws We become stained by sin and cannot be allowed back to live in God s presence We need the Savior s atoning power so that we can be reconciled to Heavenly Father Jesus Christ broke the bands of physical death allowing resurrection for all He offers forgiveness of sins conditioned on obedience to the laws and ordinances of His gospel Through Him exaltation is offered The opportunity to benefit from the Savior s atoning power is creation s most important payload For Heavenly Father s purposes to be accomplished Christ s atoning power needs to be made available to God s children 1 The priesthood delivers these opportunities It is the rocket Priesthood is essential because necessary ordinances and covenants on earth are administered only by its authority If the priesthood fails to deliver the opportunity to benefit from the Savior s atoning power what would be its purpose Would it just be a complex attention grabbing firecracker God intends priesthood to be used for more than just a class on Sunday or as a service opportunity He intends for it to deliver the payload Minor defects in rockets can cause mission failure Brittle seals and material fatigue can cause a rocket to malfunction To guard the priesthood from metaphorically brittle seals and material fatigue God protects both its conferral and use 2 Priesthood conferral is safeguarded by priesthood keys which are the rights of presidency given to man 3 Priesthood use is likewise safeguarded by priesthood keys but also by covenants that the priesthood holder makes The use of the priesthood is consequently governed by both priesthood keys and covenants A man s priesthood commission is individually given and does not exist independent of him 4 priesthood is not an amorphous source of autonomous power Both the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods are received by covenant 5 God determines the terms and man accepts Broadly speaking priesthood holders covenant to help God in His work Early in this dispensation Jesus Christ explained that the priesthood covenant is confirmed upon you for your sakes and not for your sakes only but for the sake of the whole world because they come not unto me 6This teaches that the purpose of the priesthood is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel We have the priesthood so that we can help Heavenly Father s children be relieved of the burden of sin and become like Him Through the priesthood the power of godliness is manifest in the lives of all who make and keep gospel covenants and receive the associated ordinances 7 This is the way each of us comes unto Christ is purified and is reconciled to God Christ s atoning power is made accessible through the priesthood which delivers the payload Covenants with God are serious and solemn A man should prepare for learn about and enter such covenants with the intent to honor them A covenant becomes a pledge of self Paraphrasing the English playwright Robert Bolt a man makes a covenant only when he wants to commit himself quite exceptionally to a promise He makes an identity between the truth of the promise and his own virtue When a man makes a covenant he is holding himself like water in his cupped hands And if he opens his fingers he need not hope to find himself again A covenant breaker no longer has a self to commit or a guarantee to offer 8An Aaronic Priesthood holder covenants to avoid evil help others be reconciled to God and prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood 9 These sacred responsibilities are fulfilled as he teaches baptizes strengthens Church members and invites others to accept the gospel These are his rocket functions In return God promises hope forgiveness the ministering of angels and the keys of the gospel of repentance and baptism 10A Melchizedek Priesthood holder covenants to fulfill the responsibilities associated with the Aaronic Priesthood and to magnify his calling in the Melchizedek Priesthood 11 He does so by keeping the commandments associated with the covenant These commandments include giving diligent heed to the words of eternal life by living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God 12 bearing testimony of Jesus Christ and His latter day work 13 not boasting of himself 14 and becoming the Savior s friend trusting Him as a friend would 15In return God promises that a Melchizedek Priesthood holder will receive keys to understand the mysteries of God He will become perfect so that he can stand in the presence of God He will be able to fulfill his role in the work of salvation Jesus Christ will prepare the way before the priesthood holder and will be with him The Holy Ghost will be in the priesthood holder s heart and angels will bear him up His body will be strengthened and renewed He will become heir to the blessings of Abraham and along with his wife joint heir with Jesus Christ to Heavenly Father s kingdom 16 These are exceeding great and precious promises 17 No greater promises can be imagined To each man who receives the Melchizedek Priesthood God affirms His covenant promises with an oath 18 This oath pertains only to the Melchizedek Priesthood 19 and it is God who swears the oath not the priesthood holder 20 Because this unique situation involves His divine power and authority God uses an oath employing the most forceful language He can to assure us of the binding and irreversible nature of His promises Severe consequences result from breaking priesthood covenants and altogether turning from them 21 Being casual or apathetic in a priesthood calling is like introducing material fatigue into a rocket component It jeopardizes the priesthood covenant because it can lead to mission failure Disobedience to God s commandments breaks the covenant For a perpetual unrepentant covenant breaker the promised blessings are withdrawn I came to understand more fully the relationship between the priesthood rocket and the opportunity to benefit from Christ s atoning power payload several years ago During a weekend I had two assignments One was to create the first stake in a country and the other was to interview a young man and if all was in order restore his priesthood and temple blessings This 30 year old man had joined the Church in his late teens He served an honorable mission But when he returned home he lost his way and he lost his membership in the Church After some years he came to himself 22 and with the help of loving priesthood leaders and kind members he repented and was readmitted by baptism into the Church Later he applied to have his priesthood and temple blessings restored We set an appointment for Saturday at 10 00 a m at the meetinghouse When I arrived for the earlier interviews he was already there He was so anxious to have the priesthood once again he just could not wait During our interview I showed him the letter explaining that President Thomas S Monson had personally reviewed his application and authorized the interview This otherwise stoic young man wept I then told him that the date of our interview would have no official meaning in his life He looked puzzled I informed him that after I restored his blessings his membership record would show only his original baptism confirmation priesthood ordination and endowment dates He choked up again I asked him to read from the Doctrine and Covenants Behold he who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and I the Lord remember them no more By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins behold he will confess them and forsake them 23Tears filled his eyes a third time Then I placed my hands on his head and in the name of Jesus Christ and by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood and with the authorization of the President of the Church I restored his priesthood and temple blessings The joy that came over us was profound He knew he was once again authorized to hold and exercise the priesthood of God He knew that his temple blessings were again fully operative He had a bounce in his step and a radiant light about him I was so proud of him and I sensed how proud Heavenly Father was of him too Thereafter the stake was organized The meetings were well attended by enthusiastic faithful Saints and a wonderful stake presidency was sustained However for me the historic occasion of organizing this first stake in a country was overshadowed by the joy I felt in restoring the blessings to this young man I have come to realize that the purpose of organizing a stake or using the priesthood of God in any way is to assist Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in Their work to provide the opportunity for redemption and exaltation to each of God s children Like the rocket whose purpose is to deliver a payload the priesthood delivers the gospel of Jesus Christ enabling all to make covenants and receive the associated ordinances The atoning blood of Christ 24 can thereby be applied in our lives as we experience the sanctifying influence of the Holy Ghost and receive the blessings God promises In addition to obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel yourself I invite you to make and keep priesthood covenants Receive God s oath and His promise Magnify your responsibilities in the priesthood to help Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Use the priesthood to help deliver the opportunity to benefit from the Savior s atoning power to someone else As you do great blessings will come to you and your family I testify that the Redeemer lives and directs this work in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
We get a glimpse into our Heavenly Father s character as we recognize the immense compassion He has for sinners and appreciate the distinction He makes between sin and those who sin This glimpse helps us have a more correct understanding of his character perfections and attributes 1 and is foundational to exercising faith in Him and in His Son Jesus Christ The Savior s compassion in the face of our imperfections draws us toward Him and motivates us in our repeated struggles to repent and emulate Him As we become more like Him we learn to treat others as He does regardless of any outward characteristic or behavior The impact of distinguishing between the outward characteristics of an individual and the individual himself is central to the novel Les Mis rables by the French author Victor Hugo 2 As the novel opens the narrator introduces Bienvenu Myriel the bishop of Digne and discusses a dilemma facing the bishop Should he visit a man who is an avowed atheist and is despised in the community because of his past behavior in the French Revolution 3The narrator states that the bishop could naturally feel a deep aversion for the man Then the narrator poses a simple question All the same should the scabs of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil 4 Answering for the bishop the narrator provides a definitive answer No and then adds a humorous comment But what a sheep 5In this passage Hugo compares the man s wickedness with skin disease in sheep and compares the bishop with a shepherd who does not withdraw when faced with a sheep that is sick The bishop is sympathetic and later in the novel demonstrates a similar compassion for another man the main protagonist in the novel a degraded ex convict Jean Valjean The bishop s mercy and empathy motivate Jean Valjean to change the course of his life Since God uses disease as a metaphor for sin throughout the scriptures it is reasonable to ask How does Jesus Christ react when faced with our metaphorical diseases our sins After all the Savior said that He cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance 6 so how can He look at us imperfect as we are without recoiling in horror and disgust The answer is simple and clear As the Good Shepherd 7 Jesus Christ views disease in His sheep as a condition that needs treatment care and compassion This shepherd our Good Shepherd finds joy in seeing His diseased sheep progress toward healing The Savior foretold that He would feed his flock like a shepherd 8 seek out that which is lost bring again that which is driven away bind up that which is broken and strengthen that which is sick 9 Though apostate Israel was depicted as being consumed with sinful wounds and bruises and putrifying sores 10 the Savior encouraged exhorted and promised healing 11The Savior s mortal ministry was indeed characterized by love compassion and empathy He did not disdainfully walk the dusty roads of Galilee and Judea flinching at the sight of sinners He did not dodge them in abject horror No He ate with them 12 He helped and blessed lifted and edified and replaced fear and despair with hope and joy Like the true shepherd He is He seeks us and finds us to offer relief and hope 13 Understanding His compassion and love helps us exercise faith in Him to repent and be healed The Gospel of John records the effect of the Savior s empathy on a sinner Scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in the very act of adultery to the Savior The accusers implied that she should be stoned in compliance with the law of Moses Jesus in response to persistent questioning finally said to them He that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her The accusers departed and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst When Jesus saw none but the woman he said unto her Woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee She said No man Lord And Jesus said unto her Neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more 14Surely the Savior did not condone adultery But He also did not condemn the woman He encouraged her to reform her life She was motivated to change because of His compassion and mercy The Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible attests to her resultant discipleship And the woman glorified God from that hour and believed on his name 15While God is empathetic we should not mistakenly believe that He is accepting and open minded about sin He is not The Savior came to earth to save us from our sins and importantly will not save us in our sins 16 A skilled interrogator Zeezrom once tried to trap Amulek by asking Shall the coming Messiah save his people in their sins And Amulek answered and said unto him I say unto you he shall not for it is impossible for him to deny his word He cannot save them in their sins 17 Amulek spoke a fundamental truth that to be saved from our sins we must abide the conditions of repentance which unleash the Redeemer s power to save our souls 18The Savior s compassion love and mercy draw us toward Him 19 Through His Atonement we are no longer satisfied with our sinful state 20 God is clear about what is right and acceptable to Him and what is wrong and sinful This is not because He desires to have mindless obedient followers No our Heavenly Father desires that His children knowingly and willingly choose to become like Him21 and qualify for the kind of life He enjoys 22 In doing so His children fulfill their divine destiny and become heirs to all that He has 23 For this reason Church leaders cannot alter God s commandments or doctrine contrary to His will to be convenient or popular However in our lifelong quest to follow Jesus Christ His example of kindness to those who sin is particularly instructive We who are sinners must like the Savior reach out to others with compassion and love Our role is also to help and bless lift and edify and replace fear and despair with hope and joy The Savior rebuked individuals who recoiled from others they viewed as unclean and who self righteously judged others as more sinful than they 24 That is the pointed lesson the Savior directed to those who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others He spoke this parable Two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a publican The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess And the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner Jesus then concluded I tell you this man the publican went down to his house justified rather than the other the Pharisee for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted 25The message for us is clear a repenting sinner draws closer to God than does the self righteous person who condemns that sinner The human tendency to be self righteous and judgmental was also present in Alma s day As the people began to establish the church more fully the church began to wax proud the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes they began to be scornful one towards another and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure 26This persecution was specifically prohibited Now there was a strict law among the people of the church that there should not any man belonging to the church arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church and that there should be no persecution among themselves 27 The guiding principle for Latter day Saints is the same We must not be guilty of persecuting anyone inside or outside the Church Those who have been persecuted for any reason know what unfairness and bigotry feel like As a teenager living in Europe in the 1960s I felt that I was repeatedly picked on and bullied because I was an American and because I was a member of the Church Some of my schoolmates treated me as though I were personally responsible for unpopular U S foreign policies I was also treated as though my religion were an affront to the nations in which I lived because it differed from state sponsored religion Later in various countries across the world I have had small glimpses into the ugliness of prejudice and discrimination suffered by those who are targeted because of their race or ethnicity Persecution comes in many forms ridicule harassment bullying exclusion and isolation or hatred toward another We must guard against bigotry that raises its ugly voice toward those who hold different opinions Bigotry manifests itself in part in unwillingness to grant equal freedom of expression 28 Everyone including people of religion has the right to express his or her opinions in the public square But no one has a license to be hateful toward others as those opinions are expressed Church history gives ample evidence of our members being treated with hatred and bigotry How ironically sad it would be if we were to treat others as we have been treated The Savior taught Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them 29 For us to ask for respect we must be respectful Furthermore our genuine conversion brings meekness and lowliness of heart which invites the Holy Ghost and fills us with perfect love 30 an unfeigned love 31 for others Our Good Shepherd is unchanging and feels the same way today about sin and sinners as He did when He walked the earth He does not recoil from us because we sin even if He on occasion must think But what a sheep He loves us so much that He provided the way for us to repent and become clean so we can return to Him and our Heavenly Father 32 In doing so Jesus Christ also set the example for us to follow to show respect to all and hatred toward none As His disciples let us fully mirror His love and love one another so openly and completely that no one feels abandoned alone or hopeless I testify that Jesus Christ is our Good Shepherd who loves and cares for us He knows us and laid down His life for His sheep 33 He also lives for us and wants us to know Him and exercise faith in Him I love and adore Him and I am profoundly grateful for Him in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters when I was 12 years old my family lived in G teborg a coastal city in southern Sweden By way of reference it is the hometown of our dear associate Elder Per G Malm 1 who passed away this summer We miss him We re grateful for his nobility and his noble service and for the example of his absolutely adorable family And we certainly pray God s richest blessings to be theirs Fifty years ago we attended church in a large remodeled home One Sunday my friend Steffan 2 the only other deacon in the branch greeted me at church with some excitement We went to the chapel s adjacent overflow area and he pulled from his pocket a large firecracker and some matches In an act of youthful bravado I took the firecracker and lit the long gray fuse I intended to snuff out the fuse before it blew up But when I burned my fingers trying to do so I dropped the firecracker Steffan and I watched in horror as the fuse continued to burn The firecracker exploded and sulfurous fumes filled the overflow area and the chapel We hurriedly gathered up the scattered remnants of the firecracker and opened the windows to try to get the smell out naively hoping that no one would notice Fortunately no one was hurt and no damage was done As members came to the meeting they did notice the overpowering smell It was hard to miss The smell distracted from the sacred nature of the meeting Because there were so few Aaronic Priesthood holders and in what can only be described as dissociative thinking I passed the sacrament yet I did not feel worthy to partake of it When the sacrament tray was offered to me I took neither the bread nor the water I felt horrible I was embarrassed and I knew that what I had done had displeased God After church the branch president Frank Lindberg a distinguished older man with silver gray hair asked me to come to his office After I sat down he looked at me kindly and said he had noticed that I had not partaken of the sacrament He asked why I suspect he knew why I was sure everyone knew what I had done After I told him he asked how I felt Through tears I haltingly told him I was sorry and that I knew I had let God down President Lindberg opened a well worn copy of the Doctrine and Covenants and asked me to read some underlined verses I read the following out loud Behold he who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and I the Lord remember them no more By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins behold he will confess them and forsake them 3I will never forget President Lindberg s compassionate smile when I looked up after I had finished reading With some emotion he told me that he felt it would be fine for me to resume partaking of the sacrament As I left his office I felt indescribable joy Such joy is one of the inherent results of repentance The word repent connotes to perceive afterwards and implies change 4 In Swedish the word is omv nd which simply means to turn around 5 The Christian writer C S Lewis wrote about the need and the method for change He noted that repentance involves being put back on the right road A wrong sum can be put right he said but only by going back till you find the error and working it afresh from that point never by simply going on 6 Changing our behavior and returning to the right road are part of repentance but only part Real repentance also includes a turning of our heart and will to God and a renunciation of sin 7 As explained in Ezekiel to repent is to turn from sin do that which is lawful and right restore the pledge and walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity 8Yet even this is an incomplete description It does not properly identify the power that makes repentance possible the atoning sacrifice of our Savior Real repentance must involve faith in the Lord Jesus Christ faith that He can change us faith that He can forgive us and faith that He will help us avoid more mistakes This kind of faith makes His Atonement effective in our lives When we perceive afterwards and turn around with the Savior s help we can feel hope in His promises and the joy of forgiveness Without the Redeemer the inherent hope and joy evaporate and repentance becomes simply miserable behavior modification But by exercising faith in Him we become converted to His ability and willingness to forgive sin President Boyd K Packer affirmed the hopeful promises of repentance in April 2015 at his last general conference He described the power of the Savior s Atonement to heal in what I consider the distillation of the wisdom gained in half a century of apostolic service President Packer said The Atonement leaves no tracks no traces What it fixes is fixed It just heals and what it heals stays healed 9He continued The Atonement which can reclaim each one of us bears no scars That means that no matter what we have done or where we have been or how something happened if we truly repent the Savior has promised that He would atone And when He atoned that settled that The Atonement can wash clean every stain no matter how difficult or how long or how many times repeated 10The reach of the Savior s Atonement is infinite in breadth and depth for you and for me But it will never be imposed on us As the prophet Lehi explained after we are instructed sufficiently to know good from evil 11 we are free to choose liberty and eternal life through the great Mediator of all men or to choose captivity and death 12 In other words repentance is a choice We can and sometimes do make different choices Such choices may not seem intrinsically wrong but they prevent us from becoming truly penitent and thus preclude our pursuit of real repentance For instance we may choose to blame others As a 12 year old in G teborg I could have blamed Steffan He was the one who brought the big firecracker and the matches to the church in the first place But blaming others even if justified allows us to excuse our behavior By so doing we shift responsibility for our actions to others When the responsibility is shifted we diminish both the need and our ability to act We turn ourselves into hapless victims rather than agents capable of independent action 13Another choice that impedes repentance is minimizing our mistakes In the G teborg firecracker incident no one was hurt no permanent damage occurred and the meeting was held anyway It would have been easy to say that there was no reason to repent But minimizing our mistakes even if no immediate consequences are apparent removes the motivation to change This thinking prevents us from seeing that our mistakes and sins have eternal consequences Yet another way is to think that our sins do not matter because God loves us no matter what we do It is tempting to believe what the deceitful Nehor taught the people of Zarahemla That all mankind should be saved at the last day and that they need not fear nor tremble and in the end all men should have eternal life 14 But this seductive idea is false God does love us However what we do matters to Him and to us He has given clear directives about how we should behave We call these commandments His approbation and our eternal life depend on our behavior including our willingness to humbly seek real repentance 15Additionally we forgo real repentance when we choose to separate God from His commandments After all if the sacrament were not sacred it would not matter that the smell of the firecracker was disruptive to that G teborg sacrament meeting We should be wary of discounting sinful behavior by undermining or dismissing God s authorship of His commandments Real repentance requires recognizing the Savior s divinity and the truthfulness of His latter day work Instead of making excuses let us choose repentance Through repentance we can come to ourselves like the prodigal in the parable 16 and reflect on the eternal import of our actions When we understand how our sins can affect our eternal happiness we not only become truly penitent but we also strive to become better When faced with temptation we are more likely to ask ourselves in the words of William Shakespeare What win I if I gain the thing I seek A dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy Who buys a minute s mirth to wail a week Or sells eternity to get a toy 17If we have lost sight of eternity for the sake of a toy we can choose to repent Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ we have another chance Metaphorically we can exchange the toy we so ill advisedly purchased in the first place and receive again the hope of eternity As the Savior explained For behold the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh wherefore he suffered the pain of all men that all men might repent and come unto him 18Jesus Christ can forgive because He paid the price for our sins 19Our Redeemer chooses to forgive because of His incomparable compassion mercy and love Our Savior wants to forgive because this is one of His divine attributes And like the Good Shepherd He is He is joyful when we choose to repent 20Even as we feel godly sorrow for our actions 21 when we choose to repent we immediately invite the Savior into our lives As Amulek taught Come forth and harden not your hearts any longer for behold now is the time and the day of your salvation and therefore if ye will repent and harden not your hearts immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you 22 We can feel godly sorrow for our actions and at the same time feel the joy of having the Savior s help The fact that we can repent is the good news of the gospel 23 Guilt can be swept away 24 We can be filled with joy receive a remission of our sins and have peace of conscience 25 We can be freed from feelings of despair and the bondage of sin We can be filled with the marvelous light of God and be pained no more 26 Repentance is not only possible but also joyful because of our Savior I still remember the feelings that washed over me in the branch president s office after the firecracker episode I knew I had been forgiven My feelings of guilt vanished my gloomy mood lifted and my heart felt light Brothers and sisters as we conclude this conference I invite you to feel more joy in your life joy in the knowledge that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is real joy in the Savior s ability willingness and desire to forgive and joy in choosing to repent Let us follow the instruction to with joy draw water out of the wells of salvation 27 May we choose to repent forsake our sins and turn our hearts and wills around to follow our Savior I testify of His living reality I am a witness and repeated recipient of His incomparable compassion mercy and love I pray that the redeeming blessings of His Atonement may be yours now and again and again and again throughout your lives 28 as they have been in mine In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters while living in Africa I sought advice from Elder Wilford W Andersen of the Seventy about helping Saints who live in poverty Among the remarkable insights he shared with me was this The greater the distance between the giver and the receiver the more the receiver develops a sense of entitlement This principle underlies the Church s welfare system When members are not able to meet their own needs they turn first to their families Thereafter if necessary they can also turn to their local Church leaders for assistance with their temporal needs 1 Family members and local Church leaders are closest to those in need frequently have faced similar circumstances and understand best how to help Because of their proximity to the givers recipients who receive help according to this pattern are grateful and less likely to feel entitled The concept the greater the distance between the giver and the receiver the more the receiver develops a sense of entitlement also has profound spiritual applications Our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ are the ultimate Givers The more we distance ourselves from Them the more entitled we feel We begin to think that we deserve grace and are owed blessings We are more prone to look around identify inequities and feel aggrieved even offended by the unfairness we perceive While the unfairness can range from trivial to gut wrenching when we are distant from God even small inequities loom large We feel that God has an obligation to fix things and fix them right now The difference made by our proximity to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is illustrated in the Book of Mormon in the stark contrast between Nephi and his older brothers Laman and Lemuel Nephi had great desires to know of the mysteries of God wherefore he did cry unto the Lord and his heart was softened 2 On the other hand Laman and Lemuel were distant from God they did not know Him Nephi accepted challenging assignments without complaint but Laman and Lemuel did murmur in many things Murmuring is the scriptural equivalent of childish whining The scripture records that they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them 3Nephi s closeness to God enabled him to recognize and appreciate God s tender mercies 4 In contrast when Laman and Lemuel saw Nephi receiving blessings they were wroth with him because they understood not the dealings of the Lord 5 Laman and Lemuel saw the blessings that they received as their due and petulantly assumed that they should have more They seemed to view Nephi s blessings as wrongs committed against them This is the scriptural equivalent of disgruntled entitlement Nephi exercised faith in God to accomplish what he was asked to do 6 In contrast Laman and Lemuel being hard in their hearts did not look unto the Lord as they ought 7 They seemed to feel that the Lord was obligated to provide answers to questions that they had not posed The Lord maketh no such thing known unto us they said but they did not even make the effort to ask 8 This is the scriptural equivalent of derisive skepticism Because they were distant from the Savior Laman and Lemuel murmured became contentious and were faithless They felt that life was unfair and that they were entitled to God s grace In contrast because he had drawn close to God Nephi must have recognized that life would be the most unfair for Jesus Christ Though absolutely innocent the Savior would suffer the most The closer we are to Jesus Christ in the thoughts and intents of our hearts the more we appreciate His innocent suffering the more grateful we are for grace and forgiveness and the more we want to repent and become like Him Our absolute distance from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is important but the direction we are heading is even more crucial God is more pleased with repentant sinners who are trying to draw closer to Him than with self righteous faultfinding individuals who like the Pharisees and scribes of old do not realize how badly they need to repent 9As a child I sang a Swedish Christmas carol that teaches a simple but powerful lesson drawing near to the Savior causes us to change The lyrics go something like this When Christmas morning gleamsI want to go to the stable Where God in the nighttime hoursAlready rests upon the straw How good Thou wast to desireTo come down to the earth Now I do not wish to wasteMy childhood days in sin anymore Jesus we need Thee Thou dear children s friend I no longer wish to grieve TheeWith my sins again 10When we figuratively transport ourselves to the Bethlehem stable where God in the nighttime hours already rests upon the straw we can recognize better the Savior as a gift from a kind loving Heavenly Father Rather than feeling entitled to His blessings and grace we develop an intense desire to stop causing God further grief Whatever our current direction or distance to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ we can choose to turn toward Them and draw closer to Them They will help us As the Savior told the Nephites following His Resurrection And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross that I might draw all men unto me And for this cause have I been lifted up therefore according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me 11To draw closer to the Savior we must increase our faith in Him make and keep covenants and have the Holy Ghost with us We must also act in faith responding to the spiritual direction we receive All of these elements come together in the sacrament Indeed the best way I know of to draw closer to God is to prepare conscientiously and partake worthily of the sacrament each week A friend of ours in South Africa shared how she came to this realization When Diane was a new convert she attended a branch outside of Johannesburg One Sunday as she sat in the congregation the layout of the chapel made it so that the deacon did not see her as the sacrament was passed Diane was disappointed but said nothing Another member noted the omission and mentioned it to the branch president after the meeting As Sunday School began Diane was invited to an empty classroom A priesthood holder came in He knelt down blessed some bread and handed her a piece She ate it He knelt down again and blessed some water and handed her a small cup She drank it Thereafter Diane had two thoughts in rapid succession First Oh he the priesthood holder did this just for me And then Oh He the Savior did this just for me Diane felt Heavenly Father s love Her realization that the Savior s sacrifice was just for her helped her feel close to Him and fueled an overwhelming desire to keep that feeling in her heart not just on Sunday but every day She realized that although she sat in a congregation to partake of the sacrament the covenants she made anew each Sunday were individually hers The sacrament helped and continues to help Diane feel the power of godly love recognize the Lord s hand in her life and draw closer to the Savior The Savior identified the sacrament as indispensable to a spiritual foundation He said And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things partake of the sacrament And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye for ye are built upon my rock But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock but are built upon a sandy foundation and when the rain descends and the floods come and the winds blow and beat upon them they shall fall 12Jesus did not say if rain descends if floods come and if winds blow but when No one is immune from life s challenges we all need the safety that comes from partaking of the sacrament On the day of the Savior s Resurrection two disciples traveled to a village called Emmaus Unrecognized the risen Lord joined them on the journey As they traveled He taught them from the scriptures When they reached their destination they invited Him to dine with them And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them And their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight And they said one to another Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven Apostles gathered together And then they testified to the Apostles that the Lord is risen indeed And they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread 13The sacrament truly helps us know our Savior It also reminds us of His innocent suffering If life were truly fair you and I would never be resurrected you and I would never be able to stand clean before God In this respect I am grateful that life is not fair At the same time I can emphatically state that because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ ultimately in the eternal scheme of things there will be no unfairness All that is unfair about life can be made right 14 Our present circumstances may not change but through God s compassion kindness and love we will all receive more than we deserve more than we can ever earn and more than we can ever hope for We are promised that God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away 15No matter where you stand in your relationship to God I invite you to draw nearer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ the Ultimate Benefactors and Givers of all that is good I invite you to attend sacrament meeting each week and partake of the holy emblems of the Savior s body and blood I invite you to feel God s nearness as He is made known to you as He was to the disciples of old in the breaking of the bread As you do I promise that you will feel nearer to God Natural tendencies to childish whining disgruntled entitlement and derisive skepticism will dissipate Those sentiments will be replaced by feelings of greater love and gratitude for Heavenly Father s gift of His Son As we draw closer to God the enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ will come into our lives And as with the disciples on the way to Emmaus we will find that the Savior has been nearby all along I so witness and testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters thank you for sustaining me yesterday as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles It is hard to express how much that means to me I was especially grateful for the sustaining vote of the two extraordinary women in my life my wife Ruth and our dear dear dear daughter Ashley My call gives ample evidence to the truthfulness of the Lord s statement early in this dispensation That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world 1 I am one of those weak and simple Decades ago when I was called to be the bishop of a ward in the eastern United States my brother slightly older and much wiser than I called me on the phone He said You need to know that the Lord hasn t called you because of anything you have done In your case it is probably in spite of what you have done The Lord has called you for what He needs to do through you and that will happen only if you do it His way I recognize that this wisdom from an older brother applies even more today Something wonderful happens in a missionary s service when he or she realizes that the calling is not about him or her rather it is about the Lord His work and Heavenly Father s children I feel the same is true for an Apostle This calling is not about me It s about the Lord His work and Heavenly Father s children No matter what the assignment or calling is in the Church to serve capably one must serve knowing that everyone we serve is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents and as such has a divine nature and destiny 2In my past profession I was a cardiologist specializing in heart failure and transplantation with many patients who were critically ill My wife jokingly says that it was a bad prognostic sign to become one of my patients All teasing aside I saw many people die and I developed a kind of emotional distance when things went poorly That way feelings of sadness and disappointment were tempered In 1986 a young man named Chad developed heart failure and received a heart transplant He did very well for a decade and a half Chad did all he could to stay healthy and live as normal a life as possible He served a mission worked and was a devoted son to his parents The last few years of his life though were challenging and he was in and out of the hospital frequently One evening he was brought to the hospital s emergency department in full cardiac arrest My associates and I worked for a long time to restore his circulation Finally it became clear that Chad could not be revived We stopped our futile efforts and I declared him dead Although sad and disappointed I maintained a professional attitude I thought to myself Chad has had good care He has had many more years of life than he otherwise would have had That emotional distance soon shattered as his parents came into the emergency room bay and saw their deceased son lying on a stretcher In that moment I saw Chad through his mother s and father s eyes I saw the great hopes and expectations they had had for him the desire they had had that he would live just a little bit longer and a little bit better With this realization I began to weep In an ironic reversal of roles and in an act of kindness I will never forget Chad s parents comforted me I now realize that in the Church to effectively serve others we must see them through a parent s eyes through Heavenly Father s eyes Only then can we begin to comprehend the true worth of a soul Only then can we sense the love that Heavenly Father has for all of His children Only then can we sense the Savior s caring concern for them We cannot completely fulfill our covenant obligation to mourn with those who mourn and comfort those who stand in need of comfort unless we see them through God s eyes 3 This expanded perspective will open our hearts to the disappointments fears and heartaches of others But Heavenly Father will aid and comfort us just as Chad s parents comforted me years ago We need to have eyes that see ears that hear and hearts that know and feel if we are to accomplish the rescue so frequently encouraged by President Thomas S Monson 4Only when we see through Heavenly Father s eyes can we be filled with the pure love of Christ 5 Every day we should plead with God for this love Mormon admonished Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ 6With all my heart I want to be a true follower of Jesus Christ 7 I love Him I adore Him I witness of His living reality I witness that He is the Anointed One the Messiah I am a witness of His incomparable mercy compassion and love I add my testimony to that of the Apostles who in the year 2000 stated that Jesus is the Living Christ the immortal Son of God He is the light the life and the hope of the world 8I testify that on a day in 1820 in a grove in upstate New York the risen Lord appeared along with God our Heavenly Father to the Prophet Joseph Smith just as Joseph Smith said They did Priesthood keys are on earth today to enable saving and exalting ordinances I know it In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters in December 2013 the world mourned the death of Nelson Mandela After 27 years of imprisonment for his role in the antiapartheid struggle Mandela was the first democratically elected president of South Africa His forgiveness of those who had imprisoned him was remarkable He received widespread acclaim and praise 1 Mandela frequently deflected accolades by saying I m no saint that is unless you think a saint is a sinner who keeps on trying 2This statement a saint is a sinner who keeps on trying should reassure and encourage members of the Church Although we are referred to as Latter day Saints we sometimes flinch at this reference The term Saints is commonly used to designate those who have achieved an elevated state of holiness or even perfection And we know perfectly well that we are not perfect Our theology does teach us though that we may be perfected by repeatedly and iteratively relying wholly upon the doctrine of Christ exercising faith in Him repenting partaking of the sacrament to renew the covenants and blessings of baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to a greater degree As we do so we become more like Christ and are able to endure to the end with all that that entails 3 In less formal terms God cares a lot more about who we are and who we are becoming than about who we once were 4 He cares that we keep on trying The comedy As You Like It written by the English playwright William Shakespeare depicts a dramatic change in a character s life An older brother attempts to have his younger brother killed Even knowing this the younger brother saves his wicked brother from certain death When the older brother learns of this undeserved compassion he is totally and forever changed and has what he calls a conversion Later several women approach the older brother and ask Was t you that did so oft contrive to kill your brother The older brother answers Twas I but tis not I I do not shame to tell you what I was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing I am 5For us because of God s mercy and the Atonement of Jesus Christ such a change is not just literary fiction Through Ezekiel the Lord declared As for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness If he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right Restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him he hath done that which is lawful and right 6In His mercy God promises forgiveness when we repent and turn from wickedness so much so that our sins will not even be mentioned to us For us because of the Atonement of Christ and our repentance we can look at our past deeds and say Twas I but tis not I No matter how wicked we can say That s who I was But that past wicked self is no longer who I am 7President Thomas S Monson has taught One of God s greatest gifts to us is the joy of trying again for no failure ever need be final 8 Even if we ve been a conscious deliberate sinner or have repeatedly faced failure and disappointment the moment we decide to try again the Atonement of Christ can help us And we need to remember that it is not the Holy Ghost that tells us we re so far gone that we might as well give up God s desire that Latter day Saints keep on trying also extends beyond overcoming sin Whether we suffer because of troubled relationships economic challenges or illnesses or as a consequence of someone else s sins the Savior s infinite Atonement can heal even and perhaps especially those who have innocently suffered He understands perfectly what it is like to suffer innocently as a consequence of another s transgression As prophesied the Savior will bind up the brokenhearted give beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness 9 No matter what with His help God expects Latter day Saints to keep on trying Just as God rejoices when we persevere He is disappointed if we do not recognize that others are trying too Our dear friend Thoba shared how she learned this lesson from her mother Julia Julia and Thoba were among the early black converts in South Africa After the apartheid regime ended black and white members of the Church were permitted to attend church together For many the equality of interaction between the races was new and challenging One time as Julia and Thoba attended church they felt they were treated less than kindly by some white members As they left Thoba complained bitterly to her mother Julia listened calmly until Thoba had vented her frustration Then Julia said Oh Thoba the Church is like a big hospital and we are all sick in our own way We come to church to be helped Julia s comment reflects a valuable insight We must not only be tolerant while others work on their individual illnesses we must also be kind patient supportive and understanding As God encourages us to keep on trying He expects us to also allow others the space to do the same at their own pace The Atonement will come into our lives in even greater measure We will then recognize that regardless of perceived differences all of us are in need of the same infinite Atonement Some years ago a wonderful young man named Curtis was called to serve a mission He was the kind of missionary every mission president prays for He was focused and worked hard At one point he was assigned a missionary companion who was immature socially awkward and not particularly enthusiastic about getting the work done One day while they were riding their bicycles Curtis looked back and saw that his companion had inexplicably gotten off his bike and was walking Silently Curtis expressed his frustration to God what a chore it was to be saddled with a companion he had to drag around in order to accomplish anything Moments later Curtis had a profound impression as if God were saying to him You know Curtis compared to me the two of you aren t all that different Curtis learned that he needed to be patient with an imperfect companion who nonetheless was trying in his own way My invitation to all of us is to evaluate our lives repent and keep on trying If we don t try we re just latter day sinners if we don t persevere we re latter day quitters and if we don t allow others to try we re just latter day hypocrites 10 As we try persevere and help others to do the same we are true Latter day Saints As we change we will find that God indeed cares a lot more about who we are and about who we are becoming than about who we once were 11I am deeply grateful for the Savior for His infinite Atonement and for latter day prophets who encourage us to be Latter day Saints to keep on trying 12 I witness of the Savior s living reality in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In December 1967 the first successful heart transplant was performed in Cape Town South Africa The dying man s diseased heart was removed and a healthy heart from a deceased donor was sewn in its place Since then over 75 000 heart transplants have been performed worldwide In each heart transplant recipient the patient s own body recognizes the new lifesaving heart as foreign and begins to attack it Left unchecked the body s natural response will reject the new heart and the recipient will die Medicines can suppress this natural response but the medications must be taken daily and with exactness Furthermore the condition of the new heart must be monitored Occasional heart biopsies are performed wherein small pieces of heart tissue are removed and then examined under a microscope When signs of rejection are found medications are adjusted If the rejection process is detected early enough death can be averted Surprisingly some patients become casual with their transplanted hearts They skip their medicines here and there and obtain the needed follow up less frequently than they should They think that because they feel good all is well Too often this shortsighted attitude puts the patients at risk and shortens their lives A heart transplant can prolong life for years for people who would otherwise die from heart failure But it is not the ultimate operation as Time magazine called it in 1967 1 The ultimate operation is not a physical but a spiritual mighty change of heart 2Through the Atonement of Christ and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel we undergo this ultimate operation this spiritual change of heart As a result of our transgressions our spiritual hearts have become diseased and hardened making us subject to spiritual death and separation from our Heavenly Father The Lord explained the operation that we all need A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of flesh 3Just as with heart transplant patients however this mighty change of our spiritual hearts is just the beginning Repentance baptism and confirmation are necessary but not sufficient Indeed equal if not greater care must be taken with a spiritually changed heart than with a physically transplanted heart if we are to endure to the end Only by doing so can we be held guiltless at the time of judgment 4Enduring to the end can be challenging because the tendency of the natural man is to reject the spiritually changed heart and allow it to harden No wonder the Lord cautioned to even let those who are sanctified take heed 5We all know of individuals who had this mighty change of heart but subsequently yielded to the natural man They became casual in their worship and devotion to God their hearts became hardened and they thereby jeopardized their eternal salvation The lives of the people who were converted by the preaching of the sons of Mosiah offer some insights as to how one avoids rejecting the mightily changed spiritual heart Of them we read that as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren and were converted unto the Lord never did fall away 6How did they successfully endure to the end We know that they were distinguished for their zeal towards God and also towards men for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things and they were firm in the faith of Christ even unto the end 7Their zeal towards God likely reflects an eagerness to please God and worship Him with fervor and passion Their zeal towards men suggests an ardent interest in helping and serving others Being perfectly upright and honest in all things suggests that they held their covenants firmly and did not rationalize their commitments to God or man We further know that they taught their children the gospel in their homes We know that they buried their weapons of war distancing themselves from temptations They must have frequently assessed the condition of their spiritually changed hearts They did not simply assume that all was well By figuratively examining their changed hearts they could identify any early hardening or rejection and treat it Alma the Younger poses a series of questions to contemporaries of the people of Ammon that figuratively biopsy spiritually changed hearts Alma asks If ye have experienced a change of heart and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love I would ask can ye feel so now 8 He further asks if they have been sufficiently humble free of pride and envy and kind toward their fellowman 9 By honestly answering questions like these we can correct early deviations from the strait and narrow path and keep our covenants with exactness In 1980 we moved as a family across the street from the hospital where I trained and worked I worked every day including Sundays If I finished my Sunday work by 2 00 p m I could join my wife and daughter and drive to church for meetings that began at 2 30 One Sunday late in my first year of training I knew that I would likely finish by 2 00 I realized however that if I stayed in the hospital just a little longer my wife and daughter would depart without me I could then walk home and take a needed nap I regret to say that I did just that I waited until 2 15 walked home slowly and lay down on the couch hoping to nap But I could not fall asleep I was disturbed and concerned I had always loved going to church I wondered why on this day the fire of testimony and the zeal that I had previously felt were missing I did not have to think long Because of my schedule I had become casual with my prayers and scripture study I would get up one morning say my prayers and go to work Often day blended into night and into day again before I would return home late the following evening I would then be so tired that I would fall asleep before saying a prayer or reading the scriptures The next morning the process began again The problem was that I was not doing the basic things I needed to do to keep my mightily changed heart from turning to stone I got off the couch got on my knees and pleaded with God for forgiveness I promised my Heavenly Father that I would change The next day I brought a Book of Mormon to the hospital On my to do list that day and every day since were two items praying at least morning and evening and reading in the scriptures Sometimes midnight would come and I would have to quickly find a private place to pray Some days my scripture study was brief I also promised Heavenly Father that I would always try to get to church even if I missed part of the meeting Over the course of a few weeks the zeal returned and the fire of testimony burned fiercely again I promised to never again fall into the spiritual death trap of being casual about these seemingly small actions and thereby jeopardizing things of an eternal nature regardless of circumstances To endure to the end we need to be eager to please God and worship Him with fervor and passion This means that we maintain faith in Jesus Christ by praying studying the scriptures partaking of the sacrament each week and having the Holy Ghost as our constant companion We need to actively help and serve others and share the gospel with them We need to be perfectly upright and honest in all things never compromising our covenants with God or our commitments to men regardless of circumstances In our homes we need to talk of rejoice in and preach of Christ so that our children and we ourselves will desire to apply the Atonement in our lives 10 We must identify temptations that easily beset us and put them out of reach way out of reach Finally we need to frequently biopsy our mightily changed hearts and reverse any signs of early rejection Please consider the state of your changed heart Do you detect any rejection setting in as a result of the tendency of the natural man to become casual If so find a place where you too can kneel Remember more than mortal years on this earth are at stake Do not risk forfeiting the fruits of the ultimate operation eternal salvation and exaltation I pray that we may press forward with steadfast faith in Christ and endure joyfully to the end 11 in the name of Jesus Christ amen
