History of the Salt Lake Temple Let s travel back to a hot afternoon on July 24 1847 around 2 00 p m Following an arduous 111 day journey with 148 members of the Church who comprised the first party to head west Brigham Young then President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles sick and weak from mountain fever entered the Salt Lake Valley Two days later while recovering from his illness Brigham Young led several members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and others on an exploring expedition William Clayton recorded About three quarters of a mile north of the camp we arrived on a beautiful table of land level and nicely sloping to the west 1While surveying the spot with the group Brigham Young suddenly stopped and stuck his cane in the ground exclaiming Here shall stand the Temple of our God One of his companions was Elder Wilford Woodruff who said this statement went through him like lightning and he drove a branch into the ground to mark the spot made by President Young s cane Forty acres 16 ha were selected for the temple and it was decided that the city should be laid out perfectly square North South east west with the temple being the center spot 2At general conference in April 1851 members of the Church voted unanimously to sustain a motion to build a temple to the name of the Lord 3 Two years later on February 14 1853 the site was dedicated by Heber C Kimball in a public ceremony attended by several thousand Saints and ground was broken for the foundation of the Salt Lake Temple A few months later on April 6 the massive cornerstones of the temple were laid and dedicated with elaborate ceremonies that included a color guard and bands and a procession led by Church leaders from the old tabernacle to the temple site where remarks and prayers were offered at each of the four stones 4At the groundbreaking ceremony President Young recalled that he had seen a vision when he first set foot upon the ground as they surveyed the valley floor stating I knew then just as well as I now know that this was the ground on which to erect a temple it was before me 5Ten years later Brigham Young offered the following prophetic insight at general conference in October 1863 I want to see the temple built in a manner that it will endure through the millennium This is not the only temple we shall build there will be hundreds of them built and dedicated to the Lord This temple will be known as the first temple built in the mountains by the Latter Day Saints I want that temple to stand as a proud monument of the faith perseverance and industry of the saints of God in the mountains 6In reviewing this brief history I am in awe of the seership of Brigham Young first his ensuring that to the extent possible and using construction methods available at that time and place the Salt Lake Temple would be built in a manner to endure throughout the Millennium and second his prophesying of the growth of future temples worldwide even to number them in the hundreds Salt Lake Temple Renovation Like Brigham Young our prophet of today looks over the Salt Lake Temple and all others with great care Through the years the First Presidency has from time to time counseled the Presiding Bishopric to ensure that the foundation of the Salt Lake Temple is solid When I served in the Presiding Bishopric at the request of the First Presidency we did an overall facility review of the Salt Lake Temple including an evaluation of the most recent advancements in seismic design and construction techniques Here are portions of the review provided to the First Presidency at that time In the design and construction of the Salt Lake Temple the best engineering skilled labor construction materials furnishings and other period available resources were used Since its dedication in 1893 the temple has stood firm and served as a beacon of faith and hope and as a light unto the people Great care has been taken to operate clean and maintain the temple in good condition The granite exterior and interior floor joists and support beams are in good condition Recent studies confirm that the location chosen by Brigham Young for the temple has very good soils and excellent compaction qualities 7The review concluded that normal repairs and improvements were needed to renew and update the temple including the exterior deck and surface areas obsolete utility systems and baptistry areas However consideration of a separate more comprehensive seismic upgrade beginning from the temple foundation on upward was also recommended The Temple FoundationAs you may recall President Brigham Young himself was involved in great detail in the construction of the original temple foundation which has served the temple well since its completion 127 years ago The newly proposed seismic upgrade package for the temple would utilize base isolation technology which was not even imagined at the time of its construction This is considered the latest most state of the art engineering for earthquake protection This technology recent in its development begins at the very foundation of the temple providing a robust defense against damage from an earthquake In essence it structurally strengthens the temple to stand steadfast even as the earth and environment around it undergo an earthshaking seismic event The temple renovation that would employ this technology was announced by the First Presidency last year Under the direction of the Presiding Bishopric construction commenced a few months ago in January 2020 It is estimated to be completed in approximately four years Ensuring Your Personal FoundationAs I contemplate the next four years of the life of this beautiful noble exalted and awe inspiring Salt Lake Temple I envision it more as a time of renewal rather than a time of closure In a similar way we might ask ourselves How could this extensive renewal of the Salt Lake Temple inspire us to undergo our own spiritual renewal reconstruction rebirth revitalization or restoration An introspective look may reveal that we too and our families could benefit from our doing some needed maintenance and renovation work even a seismic upgrade We might start such a process by asking What does my foundation look like What comprises the thick walled stable strong cornerstones that are part of my personal foundation upon which my testimony rests What are the foundational elements of my spiritual and emotional character that will allow me and my family to remain steadfast and immovable even to withstand the earthshaking and tumultuous seismic events that will surely take place in our lives These events similar to an earthquake are often difficult to predict and come in various levels of intensity wrestling with questions or doubt facing affliction or adversity working through personal offenses with Church leaders members doctrine or policy The best defense against these lies in our spiritual foundation What might spiritual cornerstones of our personal and family lives be They may be the simple plain and precious principles of gospel living family prayer scripture study including the Book of Mormon temple attendance and gospel learning through Come Follow Me and home evening Other helpful resources to strengthen your spiritual foundation may include the Articles of Faith the family proclamation and The Living Christ For me the principles included in the questions discussed as part of receiving a temple recommend serve as a strong basis for a spiritual foundation particularly the first four questions I see them as spiritual cornerstones We of course are familiar with these questions as President Russell M Nelson read them to us one by one in the last general conference Do you have faith in and a testimony of God the Eternal Father His Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His role as your Savior and Redeemer Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints as the prophet seer and revelator and as the only person on the earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys 8Can you see how you might consider these questions as valuable elements in your personal foundation to help you build and reinforce it Paul taught the Ephesians of a church which was built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord 9One of the greatest joys of my life is becoming acquainted with and inspired by members of the Church all over the world who are living exemplars of faith in Jesus Christ and His gospel They have strong personal foundations that allow them to withstand seismic events with steady understanding despite their heartache and pain To display this on a more personal level I recently spoke at the funeral of a beautiful vibrant young wife and mother also a family friend of ours She was a scrappy Division 1 soccer player when she met and married her dental student husband They were blessed with a beautiful precocious daughter She valiantly battled with various forms of cancer for six challenging years Despite the ever present emotional and physical distress that she experienced she trusted in her loving Heavenly Father and was often quoted widely by her social media followers for her famous saying God is in the details On one of her social media posts she wrote that someone had asked her How do you still have faith with all the heartache that surrounds you She replied firmly with these words Because faith is what gets me through these dark times Having faith doesn t mean nothing bad is going to happen Having faith allows me to believe that there will be light again And that light will be even brighter because I have walked through the dark As much darkness as I have witnessed over the years I have witnessed far more light I have seen miracles I have felt angels I have known that my Heavenly Father was carrying me None of that would have been experienced if life was easy The future of this life may be unknown but my faith is not If I choose to not have faith then I choose to only walk in darkness Because without faith darkness is all that is left 10Her unshakable testimony of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ in her words and in her actions was an inspiration for others Even though her body was weak she lifted others to be stronger I think of countless other members of the Church warriors like this sister who walk each day in faith striving to be true and undaunted disciples of our Savior Jesus Christ They learn of Christ They preach of Christ They strive to emulate Him Whether the days of their lives face steady or unstable ground their spiritual foundation is strong and immovable These are the devoted souls who understand the profound meaning of the lyrics How firm a foundation ye Saints of the Lord and who unto the Savior for refuge have fled 11 I am grateful beyond measure to walk among those who have prepared a spiritual foundation worthy of the name of Saints and who are strong and secure enough to withstand the many tumults of life I don t think we can overstate the importance of such a firm foundation in our personal lives Even at an early age our Primary children are taught as they sing of this very truth The wise man built his house upon the rock And the rains came tumbling down The rains came down and the floods came up And the house on the rock stood still 12Scripture reinforces this foundational doctrine The Savior taught the people of the Americas And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye for ye are built upon my rock But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock but are built upon a sandy foundation and when the rain descends and the floods come and the winds blow and beat upon them they shall fall 13It is the sincere hope of Church leaders that the significant renovations to the Salt Lake Temple will contribute to the fulfillment of Brigham Young s desire to see the temple built in a manner that it will endure through the millennium During the coming years may we allow these improvements made to the Salt Lake Temple to move and inspire us as individuals and families so that we too metaphorically will be built in a manner that will endure through the millennium We will do so as we fulfill the charge of the Apostle Paul to lay up in store for ourselves a good foundation against the time to come that we may lay hold on eternal life 14 It is my ardent prayer that our spiritual foundation will be sure and steadfast that our testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His role as our Savior and Redeemer will become for us our own chief cornerstone of whom I testify in His name even Jesus Christ amen 
Today I offer words of counsel for everyone but especially for you of the rising generation Primary children young men and young women You are deeply loved by the Lord s prophet for our day President Russell M Nelson so much so that he spoke to many of you last year in a special worldwide youth devotional broadcast titled Hope of Israel 1 We often hear President Nelson calling you exactly that the hope of Israel the rising generation and the future of the restored Church of Jesus Christ My young friends I would like to begin by sharing two family stories The 102nd DalmatianYears ago I arrived home from work and was startled to see white paint splattered everywhere on the ground the garage door and our red brick house I inspected the scene more closely and discovered the paint was still wet A trail of paint led toward the backyard and so I followed it There I found my five year old son with a paintbrush in his hand chasing our dog Our beautiful black Labrador was splattered almost half white What are you doing I asked in an animated voice My son stopped looked at me looked at the dog looked at the paintbrush dripping with paint and said I just want him to look like the black spotted dogs in the movie you know the one with 101 Dalmatians I loved our dog I thought he was perfect but that day my son had a different idea The Striped Kitty CatMy second story centers around Great Uncle Grover who lived in a house out in the country far from the city Uncle Grover was getting very old We thought our sons should meet him before he died So one afternoon we took a long drive to his humble house We sat together to visit and introduce him to our sons Not long into the conversation our two young boys maybe five and six years old wanted to go outside and play Uncle Grover hearing their request bent over with his face in theirs His face was so weathered and unfamiliar that the boys were a little scared of him He said to them in his gravelly voice Be careful there are a lot of skunks out there Hearing this Lesa and I were more than startled we were worried that they might get sprayed by a skunk The boys soon went outside to play as we continued to visit Later when we got in the car to go home I inquired of the boys Did you see a skunk One of them replied No we didn t see any skunks but we did see a black kitty cat with a white stripe on its back The Great DeceiverThese stories about innocent children discovering something about life and reality may make each of us smile but they also illustrate a more profound concept In the first story our young son had a beautiful dog as a pet notwithstanding he grabbed a gallon of paint and with paintbrush in hand determined to create his own imagined reality In the second account the boys were blissfully unaware of the unsavory threat they faced from a skunk Unable to properly identify what they had actually encountered they ran the risk of suffering some unfortunate consequences These are stories of mistaken identity presuming the real thing to be something else In each case the consequences were minor However many today grapple with these same issues on a much larger scale They are either unable to see things as they truly are or are unsatisfied with truth Moreover there are forces at play today designed to deliberately lead us away from absolute truth These deceptions and lies go far beyond innocent mistaken identity and often have dire not minor consequences Satan the father of lies and the great deceiver would have us question things as they really are and either ignore eternal truths or replace them with something that appears more pleasing He maketh war with the saints of God 2 and has spent millennia calculating and practicing the ability to persuade God s children to believe that good is evil and evil is good He has made a reputation for himself convincing mortals that skunks are just kittens or that with an application of paint you can turn a Labrador into a Dalmatian Let s now turn to an example of this very principle found in the scriptures when the Lord s prophet Moses came face to face with this same issue Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain he saw God face to face and he talked with him 3 God taught Moses about his eternal identity Though Moses was mortal and imperfect God taught that Moses was in the similitude of mine Only Begotten and mine Only Begotten shall be the Savior 4To summarize in this marvelous vision Moses beheld God and he also learned something important about himself he was indeed a son of God Listen carefully to what happened as this wondrous vision closed And it came to pass that Satan came tempting him saying Moses son of man worship me 5 Moses courageously replied Who art thou For behold I am a son of God in the similitude of his Only Begotten and where is thy glory that I should worship thee 6In other words Moses said You cannot deceive me for I know who I am I was created in the image of God You don t have His light and glory So why should I worship you or fall prey to your deception Now pay attention to how Moses further responds He declares Get thee hence Satan deceive me not 7There is much we can learn from Moses s mighty response to temptation from the adversary I invite you to respond the same way when you feel influenced by temptation Command the enemy of your soul by saying Go away You have no glory Do not tempt or lie to me For I know I am a child of God And I will always call upon my God for His help The adversary however does not easily abandon his destructive motives to deceive and demean us He certainly did not do so with Moses instead desiring to cause Moses to forget who he was eternally As if he were throwing a childish tantrum Satan cried with a loud voice and ranted upon the earth and commanded saying I am the Only Begotten worship me 8Let s review Did you hear what he just said I am the Only Begotten Worship me The great deceiver said in effect Don t worry I won t harm you I m not a skunk I am just an innocent black and white kitty cat Moses then called upon God and received His divine strength Even though the adversary trembled and the earth shook Moses did not yield His voice was certain and clear Depart from me Satan he declared for this one God only will I worship which is the God of glory 9Finally he departed from the presence of Moses 10After the Lord appeared and blessed Moses for his obedience the Lord said Blessed art thou Moses for thou shalt be made stronger than many waters And lo I am with thee even unto the end of thy days 11Moses s resistance of the adversary is a vivid and enlightening example for each of us no matter our stage in life It is a powerful message for you personally to know what to do when he tries to deceive you For you like Moses have been blessed with the gift of heavenly help Commandments and BlessingsHow might you find this heavenly help even as Moses did and not be deceived or give in to temptation A clear channel for divine assistance was reaffirmed in this dispensation by the Lord Himself when He declared Wherefore I the Lord knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth called upon my servant Joseph Smith Jun and spake unto him from heaven and gave him commandments 12 Using simpler words we might say that the Lord who knows the end from the beginning 13 knows the unique difficulties of our day Therefore He has provided a way for us to resist challenges and temptations many of which come as a direct result of the deceitful influences of the adversary and his attacks The way is simple Through His servants God speaks to us His children and gives us commandments We could restate the verse I just quoted to say I the Lord called upon my servant President Russell M Nelson and spake unto him from heaven and gave him commandments Isn t that a glorious truth I bear solemn witness that the Lord did in all reality speak to Joseph Smith from heaven beginning with the grand First Vision He also speaks to President Nelson in our time I testify that God communed with prophets in past ages and gave them commandments designed to lead His children to happiness in this life and glory in the next God continues to give commandments to our living prophet today Examples abound a more home centered Church supported balance in gospel instruction the replacement of home and visiting teaching with ministering adjustments to temple procedures and ordinances and the new Children and Youth program I marvel at the goodness and compassion of a loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ who restored the Savior s Church to earth once again and have called a prophet in our day The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ offsets perilous times with the fulness of times Wickedness Never Was HappinessObedience to commandments given to our prophet is a key not only in avoiding the influence of the deceiver but also in experiencing lasting joy and happiness This divine formula is rather simple righteousness or obedience to commandments brings blessings and blessings bring happiness or joy into our lives However in the same way that the adversary tried to deceive Moses he seeks to trick you He has always pretended to be something that he is not He always attempts to hide who he truly is He claims that obedience will make your life miserable and that it will rob you of happiness Can you think of some of his ploys to deceive For instance he disguises the destructive consequences of illicit drugs or drinking and instead suggests that it will bring pleasure He immerses us in the various negative elements that can exist in social media including debilitating comparisons and idealized reality In addition he camouflages other dark harmful content found online such as pornography blatant attacks on others through cyberbullying and sowing misinformation to cause doubt and fear in our hearts and minds Cunningly he whispers Just follow me and you will surely be happy The words written so many centuries ago by a Book of Mormon prophet are especially relevant for our day Wickedness never was happiness 14 May we recognize Satan s deceptions for what they are May we withstand and see through the lies and influences of the one who seeks to destroy our souls and steal from us our present joy and future glory My dear brothers and sisters we must continue to be faithful and vigilant for so is the only way to discern truth and to hear the voice of the Lord through His servants For the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not These things are manifested unto us plainly for the salvation of our souls For God also spake them unto prophets of old 15 We are the Saints of Almighty God the hope of Israel Will we falter Shall we shrink or shun the fight No To God s command soul heart and hand faithful and true we will ever stand 16I bear my witness of the Holy One of Israel even the name of Jesus Christ I testify of His abiding love truth and joy that are made possible by His infinite and eternal sacrifice As we obey His commandments we will always be led in the right way and will not be deceived In the sacred name of our Savior Jesus Christ amen 
Last December the First Presidency issued a statement announcing that 11 year old boys would begin attending Aaronic Priesthood quorums at the beginning of January in the year they turn 12 1As a result during the first part of this year there were quite a few startled 11 year olds who had assumed they would be staying in Primary until their next birthday but were now passing the sacrament on Sundays as the Church s newest ordained deacons I wonder who was surprised most by the change the deacons or their parents Of these almost 80 000 new deacons many are with us tonight in this great Conference Center or are participating through technology Welcome to the great brotherhood of the priesthood This change makes this meeting a historic one it is likely the largest group of Aaronic Priesthood holders ever to attend a general priesthood session of general conference In light of this special occasion I direct my remarks especially to the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood Lessons Learned from SportsAs students many of you are also developing your talents interests and hobbies through extracurricular activities at school or in private lessons teams and groups outside of school including sports Having enjoyed sports throughout my life I have always admired those who develop their athletic abilities to the point where they perform at high levels For someone to be really good at anything it takes in addition to natural talent great discipline sacrifice and countless hours of training and practice Such athletes often hear the sometimes harsh criticisms of coaches and willingly put aside what they want now for something greater in the future We know Church members and priesthood holders who have experienced success at the highest levels of professional athletics There are many good examples but I can list only a few here for the sake of time You might recognize some of these athletes in baseball Jeremy Guthrie and Bryce Harper in basketball Jabari Parker and Jimmer Fredette in soccer Ricardo Rojas in rugby league William Hopoate and in football Taysom Hill and Daniel Sorensen Each has made significant contributions to his sport While they are extremely successful in their sports these athletes would be the first to admit they are not perfect athletes or perfect human beings They work hard to be the best in their sport and to live the gospel They get up if they stumble and they strive to endure to the end Study the PlaybookIn team sports plays are developed for certain game situations and compiled into a playbook Athletes learn their specific assignment for each play Successful players study the playbook so thoroughly that when a play is called they know exactly almost instinctively where to go and what to do Photograph by Dave Kaup REUTERS stock adobe comIn a similar way we holders of the priesthood also have a team a quorum and a playbook the holy scriptures and words of modern prophets Do you strengthen your teammates How well have you studied your playbook Do you fully understand your assignment Confronting the OppositionTo take the analogy even further great coaches know the strengths and weaknesses of their team as well as those of the opposition They create a game plan that will give them the best chance for victory What about you You know what temptations you are most vulnerable to and you can predict how the adversary will try to derail and dishearten you Have you created a personal game plan and playbook so that you will know how to respond when faced with opposition As you confront various moral temptations whether in the company of others or when you are alone staring at a screen you know your game plan If a friend suggests you drink alcohol or try drugs you know the play You have practiced and know how to react in advance With a game plan a playbook and a firm commitment to execute your role you will find that temptation has less control over you You will have already made the decision of how you will react and what you will do You won t need to decide every time you are confronted with temptation One of the Twelve recently shared a story that illustrates this principle As a priest in high school he was hanging out with his friends After they got something to eat they were driving around when someone suggested they should go to a certain movie The problem was he knew it was a movie he shouldn t see Although he immediately felt pressure and anxiety about the situation he had planned for this This was a page straight out of his priesthood playbook Taking a deep breath and summoning his courage he announced I m not interested in that movie Just drop me off at my house which they did A simple play leading to a victory Years later one of the friends with him that night described how this example proved to be a great strength for him to courageously face similar circumstances in his own life Pages from the PlaybookI asked a few of the Brethren to recommend plays you might include in your playbook Here are some of their inspired suggestions Pray every day for greater light and a testimony of Jesus Christ Listen carefully to the teachings of your parents your bishop and your Young Men and quorum leaders Avoid pornography and immoral social media content Remember the promises you have made to God and work to keep them Study scripture stories of great prophets and emulate their good qualities Bless Heavenly Father s children through service Seek good friends to help you become the person you want to be Become an expert in the FamilySearch app and research your own family history Plan places of retreat where you can escape evil influences Love and help strengthen other members of your priesthood quorum I also communicated with the athletes whose pictures we viewed earlier I found it interesting that they do not identify themselves only by what they do as professional athletes but also by who they are as sons of a loving Heavenly Father and holders of the priesthood of God Now let s listen to their thoughts Jimmer Fredette here as a deacon learning to tie his tie says I have learned to lean heavily on my knowledge and faith of the truthfulness of the gospel This has guided me to be a worthy priesthood holder and above all a positive example Bryce Harper here as a husband writes I thought fame fortune and an MVP award would make me happy Something was missing So I prepared and entered the temple I am now on a path to return to my Heavenly Father and have an eternal family which is the greatest joy in the world Daniel Sorensen here as a missionary says A good playbook is a plan that uses the talents and strengths of each team member As I study and practice the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ I can know how to use my strengths to serve in the priesthood Jeremy Guthrie here currently serving as mission president shared As a 12 year old deacon I felt the Spirit testify to me that this life is the time to prepare to meet God 2 The game plan is faith in God unto action and repentance through the Savior The playbook is found in the holy scriptures and through living prophets Jabari Parker here at his ordination to the office of elder says I couldn t imagine the person that I would ve turned out to be if I hadn t made the decision to be baptized I m so grateful that I have God in my life to guide me every day Ricardo Rojas here currently serving as branch president said Through God s priesthood we can help in His work We are called to be strong and of a good courage 3 in defending the truth This has helped him succeed both on the pitch and as a priesthood holder Taysom Hill here as a missionary feels the gospel of Jesus Christ has served as a playbook for him in his life He shared Believing in God s plan and doing my best to fulfill my role in it has given me an overwhelming sense of peace and happiness in life knowing God is pleased with my efforts William Hopoate here at his son s baby blessing with four generations says that the gospel helps him identify the opposition s strategies and provides the spiritual efficacy to withstand fiery darts and better serve others What about you Do you recognize your higher and holier identity as a son of God a bearer of His holy priesthood With this eternal identity in mind create your game plan and priesthood playbook that will guide you during times of temptation and adversity Consider both offensive and defensive strategies Offensive strategies help strengthen testimonies and increase resolve to stay on the strait and narrow path Examples include regular prayer scripture study church and temple attendance paying tithing and following the counsel found in the For the Strength of Youth booklet Defensive strategies include planning ahead how you will face temptation When tempted to compromise your personal standards you know beforehand what you will do You need a playbook for that Don t feel like praying today Time to execute the play you already game planned Do you feel your testimony waning You have a play for that You know what to do All Stars in God s EyesYou are bearers of the holy priesthood of God Your commitment to hold firmly the iron rod will transform you into the eternal being who you were created to become God knows and loves you He will bless you and guide your steps You might be thinking that you are no one special that you are not all star material But that is not true Don t you know that God has proclaimed The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones 4So do you feel weak insignificant Congratulations you just made the lineup Do you feel unimportant inferior You may be just who God needs What greater example is there than David stepping onto the battlefield against a frightening opponent Goliath Relying on the Lord with a plan David saved not only himself but the army of Israel 5 Know that the Lord will be with you as you summon your courage to be on His side If God be for us who can be against us 6He can open doors and help us find strengths and abilities we never knew we had 7Listen to your trusted coaches such as your parents bishop and Young Men leaders Learn the playbook Read the scriptures Study the words of modern day prophets Create your own game plan of how you will prove yourself as a disciple of Christ Know in advance the plays you will employ to strengthen your spirit and avoid the snares of the adversary Do this and God will surely utilize you Now there may be some who detach themselves from the gospel and wander away Others may sit in the stands and watch the game from afar Some may choose to stay on the bench even though the coach has tried to send them in I invite you to rescue support and love them as a fellow team member Others want to get in the game and do What matters most is not how talented they are but their willingness to put themselves on the field They do not wait to have their number called because they know the scripture that says If ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work 8You can put yourself in the lineup You do this as you study and execute your priesthood playbook Along the way you will most likely stumble and fall perhaps many many times You are not perfect falling is part of the qualifying process that allows you to refine your character and serve in a more compassionate way The Savior and His infinite Atonement provide the way to overcome our mistakes through sincere repentance Great athletes spend hundreds of hours perfecting one small aspect of their game As a priesthood holder you need the same mind set If you fail repent and learn from it Practice so you will do better the next time Ultimately it s up to you Will you learn the playbook I urge you Trust in the Lord Put on the whole armor of God 9 and get in the game There aren t many who play professional sports at the highest levels but when it comes to discipleship there are many who choose to follow Christ In fact that is your mission in this life to learn the ways of the Lord enter the path of discipleship and strive to live according to God s plan God will uphold and bless you as you turn to Him You can do this because you are an all star in His eyes I pray that you will make the commitment to live worthy of the holy priesthood that you bear and strive to execute your sacred role every day I bless you with the ability and desire to do so I add my testimony of the power of the priesthood that you hold of living prophets and of Jesus Christ and His role as our Savior and Redeemer In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In a recent conversation with a friend of mine he told me that when he was a young newly baptized member of the Church he suddenly felt like somehow he did not fit in anymore in his ward The missionaries who taught him had been transferred away and he felt like he was on the periphery Without friends in the ward he found his old friends and with them engaged in activities that took him away from participating at church so much so that he began to stray from the flock With tears in his eyes he described how deeply grateful he was when a fellow ward member extended a ministering hand to him and in a warm and inclusive way invited him to return Within months he was back in the safety of the flock strengthening others as well as himself Aren t we grateful for the shepherd in Brazil who sought after this young man Elder Carlos A Godoy who now sits behind me as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy Isn t it remarkable how such small efforts can have eternal consequences This truth is at the heart of the Church s ministering efforts Heavenly Father can take our simple daily efforts and turn them into something miraculous It has been only six months since President Russell M Nelson announced that the Lord has made important adjustments in the way we care for each other 1 explaining We will implement a newer holier approach to caring for and ministering to others We will refer to these efforts simply as ministering 2President Nelson also explained A hallmark of the Lord s true and living Church will always be an organized directed effort to minister to individual children of God and their families Because it is His Church we as His servants will minister to the one just as He did We will minister in His name with His power and authority and with His loving kindness 3Since the announcement your response has been incredible We have received reports of the great success in implementing these changes in nearly every stake in the world as directed by our living prophet For example ministering brothers and sisters have been assigned to families companionships including young men and young women have been organized and ministering interviews are taking place I don t think it is a coincidence that six months prior to the revelatory announcement of yesterday a new balance and connection between gospel instruction in the home and in the Church 4 the revelatory announcement on ministering was given Beginning January as we spend one less hour in our church worship all that we have learned in ministering will help us rebalance that void in a higher and holier home centered Sabbath day experience with family and loved ones With these organizational structures in place we might ask How do we know we are ministering in the Lord s way Are we assisting the Good Shepherd in the way He intends In a recent discussion President Henry B Eyring commended the Saints in adjusting to these notable changes but also expressed his sincere hope that members recognize that ministering is more than just being nice That is not to say that being nice is inconsequential but those who understand the true spirit of ministering realize that it goes far beyond merely being nice Done in the Lord s way ministering can have a far reaching influence for good that ripples throughout all eternity as it has for Elder Godoy The Savior showed by example what it means to minister as He served out of love He taught prayed for comforted and blessed those around Him inviting all to follow Him As Church members minister in a higher and holier way they prayerfully seek to serve as He would to watch over the church always and be with and strengthen them visit the house of each member and help each become a true disciple of Jesus Christ 5We understand that a true shepherd loves his sheep knows each one by name and has personal interest in them 6My friend of many years spent his life as a rancher doing the hard work of raising cattle and sheep in the rugged Rocky Mountains He once shared with me the challenges and hazards associated with raising sheep He described that in early spring when snow on the expansive mountain range had mostly melted he placed the family herd of approximately 2 000 sheep in the mountains for the summer There he watched over the sheep until late fall when they were moved from the summer range to a winter range in the desert He described how tending a large flock of sheep was difficult requiring early days and late nights waking well before sunrise and finishing long after dark He could not possibly do it alone Others helped tend the flock including a mix of experienced ranch hands assisted by younger hands who were benefiting from the wisdom of their companions He also relied on two old horses two colts in training two old sheepdogs and two or three sheepdog pups Over the course of the summer my friend and his sheep faced wind and rainstorms sickness injuries drought and just about every other hardship one can imagine Some years they had to haul water all summer just to keep the sheep alive Then every year in late fall when winter weather threatened and the sheep were taken off the mountain and counted there were usually more than 200 that were lost The flock of 2 000 sheep placed in the mountains in early spring was reduced to less than 1 800 Most of the missing sheep were not lost to sickness or natural death but to predators such as mountain lions or coyotes These predators usually found the lambs that had strayed from the safety of the flock withdrawing themselves from the protection of their shepherd Would you consider for a moment what I have just described in a spiritual context Who is the shepherd Who is the flock Who are those who assist the shepherd The Lord Jesus Christ Himself said I am the good shepherd and know my sheep and I lay down my life for the sheep 7The prophet Nephi likewise taught that Jesus shall feed his sheep and in him they shall find pasture 8 I find abiding peace in knowing that the Lord is my shepherd 9 and that each of us is known by Him and under His care When we confront life s wind and rainstorms sickness injuries and drought the Lord our Shepherd will minister to us He will restore our souls In the same way that my friend tended his sheep with the assistance of young and old ranch hands horses and sheepdogs the Lord also requires assistance in the challenging labor of caring for the sheep in His flock As children of a loving Heavenly Father and as sheep in His flock we enjoy the blessing of being individually ministered to by Jesus Christ Simultaneously we have a responsibility to provide ministering assistance to others around us as shepherds ourselves We heed the words of the Lord to serve me and go forth in my name and gather together my sheep 10Who is a shepherd Every man woman and child in the kingdom of God is a shepherd No calling is required From the moment we emerge from the waters of baptism we are commissioned to this work We reach out in love to others because it is what our Savior commanded us to do Alma emphasized For what shepherd having many sheep doth not watch over them that the wolves enter not and devour his flock Doth he not drive him out 11 Whenever our neighbors are in distress temporally or spiritually we run to their aid We bear one another s burdens that they may be light We mourn with those who mourn We comfort those who stand in need of comfort 12 The Lord lovingly expects this of us And the day will come when we will be held accountable for the care we take in ministering to His flock 13My shepherd friend shared another important element in the watchcare of sheep on the range He described that lost sheep were particularly vulnerable to the dangers of predators In fact up to 15 percent of his and his team s total time was devoted to finding lost sheep The sooner they found lost sheep before the sheep drifted too far from the flock the less likely the sheep were to be harmed Recovering lost sheep required much patience and discipline Some years ago I found an article in a local newspaper so intriguing that I saved it The front page headline read Determined Dog Won t Abandon Lost Sheep 14 This article describes a small number of sheep belonging to an operation not far from my friend s property that were somehow left behind in their summer range Two or three months later they became stranded and snowbound in the mountains When the sheep were left behind the sheepdog stayed with them for it was his duty to look after and protect the sheep He would not go off watch There he remained circling about the lost sheep for months in the cold and snowy weather serving as a protection against coyotes mountain lions or any other predator that would harm the sheep He stayed there until he was able to lead or herd the sheep back to the safety of the shepherd and the flock The image captured on the front page of this article allows one to see character in the eyes and demeanor of this sheepdog In the New Testament we find a parable and instruction from the Savior that provide further insight pertaining to our responsibility as shepherds ministering sisters and brothers of lost sheep What man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it And when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing And when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbours saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost 15As we summarize the lesson taught in the parable we find this valuable counsel We are to identify the lost sheep We search after them until they are found When they are found we may have to lay them on our shoulders to bring them home We surround them with friends upon their return Brothers and sisters our greatest challenges and our greatest rewards may come as we minister to lost sheep The members of the Church in the Book of Mormon watch ed over their people and did nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness 16 We can follow their examples and remember that ministering is to be led by the Spirit flexible and customized to the needs of each member It is also critical that we seek to help individuals and families prepare for their next ordinance keep their covenants and become self reliant 17Every soul is precious to our Heavenly Father His personal invitation to minister is of greatest value and importance to Him for it is His work and glory It is quite literally the work of eternity Each one of His children has immeasurable potential in His sight He loves you with a love you cannot even begin to comprehend Like the devoted sheepdog the Lord will stay on the mountain to protect you through the wind rainstorms snow and more President Russell M Nelson taught us last conference Our message to the world and may I add to our ministering flock is simple and sincere we invite all of God s children on both sides of the veil to come unto their Savior receive the blessings of the holy temple have enduring joy and qualify for eternal life 18May we raise our sights to this prophetic vision so we can shepherd souls to the temple and ultimately to our Savior Jesus Christ He does not expect us to perform miracles He asks only that we bring our brothers and sisters unto Him for He has the power to redeem souls As we do so we can and will secure this promise And when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away 19 Of this I testify and of Jesus Christ as our Savior and our Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I have fervently prayed that the Holy Ghost will be with each of us today on this heavenly occasion What we have collectively witnessed has been most impressive as the 17th prophet of this dispensation has been sustained in solemn assembly As I sought guidance to know the topic the Lord would have me address today my mind was directed to a recent conversation with the newly called First Presidency In this discussion one of the counselors shared words to this effect I deeply hope that the membership of the Church can comprehend the magnitude of what has taken place with the calling of our new prophet President Russell M Nelson and the significance and sacredness of the solemn assembly that will take place at general conference He further observed It has been 10 years and many especially the youth of the Church do not remember or have not experienced this before This caused me to reflect on experiences I have had The first prophet I remember is President David O McKay I was 14 years old when he passed away I remember a sense of loss that accompanied his passing the tears in my mother s eyes and the sorrow felt by our whole family I remember how the words Please bless President David O McKay fell out of my lips so naturally in my prayers that if I wasn t mindful even following his passing I would find myself using those same words I wondered if my heart and mind would transition to the same feeling and conviction for the prophets succeeding him But almost like parents who love each of their children I found a love for connection with and testimony of President Joseph Fielding Smith who followed President McKay and for each prophet thereafter Harold B Lee Spencer W Kimball Ezra Taft Benson Howard W Hunter Gordon B Hinckley Thomas S Monson and today President Russell M Nelson I fully sustained each prophet with uplifted hand and uplifted heart As each of our beloved prophets has passed on it is only natural to feel a sense of sorrow and loss But our sadness is tempered by the joy and hope that come as we experience one of the great blessings of the Restoration the calling and sustaining of a living prophet on the earth To that end I will speak to this divine process as observed over the past 90 days I will describe it in four segments first the passing of our prophet and the dissolution of the First Presidency second the period of time awaiting the reorganization of the new First Presidency third the calling of the new prophet and fourth the sustaining of the new prophet and First Presidency in solemn assembly The Passing of a ProphetOn January 2 2018 our dear prophet Thomas S Monson passed to the other side of the veil He will forever have a place in our hearts President Henry B Eyring offered sentiments at President Monson s passing which succinctly describe our feelings The hallmark of his life like the Savior s will be his individual concern in reaching out to the poor the sick even all individuals worldwide 1President Spencer W Kimball explained As one star sinks behind the horizon another comes into the picture and death spawns life The work of the Lord is endless Even when a powerful leader dies not for a single instant is the Church without leadership thanks to the kind Providence who gave his kingdom continuity and perpetuity As it already has happened before in this dispensation a people reverently close a grave dry their tears and turn their faces to the future 2The Apostolic InterregnumThe period of time between the death of a prophet and the reorganization of the First Presidency is referred to as an apostolic interregnum During this period the Quorum of the Twelve under the leadership of the quorum president jointly holds the keys to administer the leadership of the Church President Joseph F Smith taught There is always a head in the Church and if the Presidency of the Church are removed by death or other cause then the next head of the Church is the Twelve Apostles until a presidency is again organized 3The most recent interregnum period began when President Monson passed away on January 2 and ended 12 days later on Sunday January 14 On that Sabbath morning the Quorum of the Twelve met in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple in a spirit of fasting and prayer under the presiding direction of President Russell M Nelson the senior Apostle and President of the Quorum of the Twelve Calling of a New ProphetIn this sacred and memorable meeting following a well established precedent in unity and unanimity the Brethren were seated by seniority in a semicircle of 13 chairs and raised their hands first to sustain the organization of a First Presidency and then to sustain President Russell Marion Nelson as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints This sustaining was followed by the Quorum of the Twelve gathering in a circle and placing hands upon the head of President Nelson to ordain and set him apart with the next most senior Apostle acting as voice President Nelson then named his counselors President Dallin Harris Oaks President Henry Bennion Eyring with President Oaks as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and President Melvin Russell Ballard as the Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Following similar sustaining votes each of these Brethren was set apart to his respective office by President Nelson This was a deeply sacred experience with an outpouring of the Spirit I offer to you my absolute witness that the will of the Lord for which we fervently prayed was powerfully manifest in the activities and events of that day With the ordination of President Nelson and the reorganization of the First Presidency the apostolic interregnum ended and the newly constituted First Presidency began to operate without remarkably even one second of interruption in governing the Lord s kingdom on the earth Solemn AssemblyThis morning this divine process is culminated in accordance with scriptural mandate outlined in the Doctrine and Covenants For all things must be done in order and by common consent in the church by the prayer of faith 4 and three Presiding High Priests upheld by the confidence faith and prayer of the church form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church 5Elder David B Haight described a previous occurrence of what we participated in today We are witnesses to and participants in a most sacred occasion a solemn assembly to act upon heavenly things As in olden times there has been much fasting and prayer offered by the Saints throughout the world that they may receive an outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord which is so much in evidence on this occasion this morning A solemn assembly as the name implies denotes a sacred sober and reverent occasion when the Saints assemble under the direction of the First Presidency 6Brothers and sisters we can rejoice even shout Hosanna that the Lord s mouthpiece a prophet of God is in place and that the Lord is pleased that His work is being done in the way that He has divinely prescribed President Russell M NelsonThis divinely ordained process leads to another divinely called prophet Just as President Monson was one of the grandest inhabitants to grace this earth so is President Nelson He has been profoundly prepared and specifically tutored by the Lord to lead us at this time It is a great blessing to now have dear President Russell M Nelson as our loving and devoted prophet the 17th President of the Church in this final dispensation President Nelson is truly a remarkable man I had the privilege of serving in the Quorum of the Twelve with him as my quorum president for just over two years I have traveled with him and marvel at his energy as one must move quickly to keep up with his pace In total he has visited 133 countries in his lifetime His outreach is to all young and old He seems to know everyone and is particularly gifted at remembering names All who know him feel that they are his favorite And so it is with each of us because of his genuine love and concern for everyone My primary association with President Nelson has been in ecclesiastical roles yet I have also become familiar with the professional life that President Nelson led before he was called as a General Authority As many of you know President Nelson was a world renowned heart surgeon and early in his medical career a pioneer developer of the heart lung machine He was on the research team that supported the first open heart operation on a human being in 1951 using a heart lung bypass President Nelson performed a heart operation on President Spencer W Kimball not long before President Kimball became the prophet Interestingly as President Nelson s call to the Twelve 34 years ago ended a professional medical career of strengthening and repairing hearts it began a ministry as an Apostle devoted to strengthening and repairing hearts of countless tens of thousands around the world each having been lifted and healed by his words and acts of wisdom service and love A Christlike HeartWhen I envision a Christlike heart in daily practice I see President Nelson I have not met anyone who exemplifies this trait at a higher level than he does It has been a remarkable tutelage for me to be in the position to observe firsthand the manifestations of the Christlike heart of President Nelson Within weeks of my call to the Twelve in October 2015 I had the opportunity to get an up close glimpse of the past professional life of President Nelson I was invited to attend an event where he was honored as a pioneer of heart surgery When I entered the venue I was astonished to see the large number of professionals there to honor and recognize the work that President Nelson had done many years before as a medical doctor and surgeon That evening numerous professionals stood and expressed their respect and admiration for President Nelson s outstanding contribution to his medical specialty As impressive as each of the presenters was in describing President Nelson s various accomplishments I was even more spellbound by a conversation I struck up with a man seated next to me He did not know who I was but he knew President Nelson as Dr Nelson director of the thoracic surgery residency program at a medical school in 1955 This man was President Nelson s former student He shared many memories Most interesting was his description of President Nelson s teaching style which he said brought with it a large measure of notoriety He explained that much of the teaching of heart surgery residents was conducted in the operating room There residents observed and performed surgery under faculty supervision as a laboratory classroom He shared that the operating room environment under certain faculty surgeons was chaotic competitive pressure filled and even ego driven This man described it as a difficult environment sometimes even demeaning As a result resident surgeons even felt their careers were often on the line He then explained the unique environment found in President Nelson s operating room It was peaceful calm and dignified Residents were treated with deep respect However following the demonstration of a procedure Dr Nelson expected the highest standard of performance from each of the residents This man further described how the best patient outcomes and the best surgeons came out of Dr Nelson s operating room This is no surprise to me at all This is what I have observed firsthand and been truly blessed by in the Quorum of the Twelve I feel like I have been in a sense one of his residents in training President Nelson has an exceptional way of teaching others and offering correction in a positive respectful and uplifting manner He is the embodiment of a Christlike heart and an example to us all From him we learn that in any circumstance we find ourselves our conduct and hearts can be in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ We now have the great blessing to sustain our prophet President Russell M Nelson Throughout his life he has magnified his numerous roles as student father professor husband doctor priesthood leader grandfather and Apostle He fulfilled these roles then and continues to do so with the heart of a prophet Brothers and sisters what we have witnessed and participated in today a solemn assembly leads to my witness that President Russell M Nelson is the Lord s living mouthpiece for all humankind I also add my testimony of God the Father of Jesus Christ and of His role as our Savior and Redeemer In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On August 21 of this year two rare events occurred that captured the attention of people around the world The first was the 90th birthday celebration of our beloved prophet President Thomas S Monson At the time I was on assignment in the Pacific Area and was thrilled that the Saints of Australia Vanuatu New Zealand and French Polynesia were not only aware of his personal milestone but they also rejoiced in celebrating it I felt fortunate to share in their warm expressions of faith and love for this great man What an inspiration it is to see the connection Latter day Saints share with their prophet Of course President Monson mindful of those desiring to wish him happy birthday described an ideal birthday gift Find someone who is having a hard time or is ill or lonely and do something for them That s all I would ask 1 We love and sustain you President Monson Solar EclipseThe other rare and heavenly event occurring on the same day and captivating millions worldwide was a total solar eclipse This was the first time such an eclipse had marched across the entire United States in 99 years 2 Have you ever seen a solar eclipse Perhaps I could describe this in greater detail A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the earth and the sun almost completely blocking any light from the sun s surface 3 The fact that this can happen is a marvel to me If you imagine the sun as the size of a common bicycle tire the moon in comparison would scarcely be the size of a small pebble How is it possible that the very source of our warmth light and life could be so greatly obscured by something comparatively insignificant in size Although the sun is 400 times larger than the moon it is also 400 times farther away from the earth 4 From earth s perspective this geometry makes the sun and moon appear to be the same size When the two are aligned just right the moon seems to obscure the entire sun Friends and family of mine who were in the zone of total eclipse described how light was replaced by darkness the stars appeared and birds quit singing The air became chilly as temperatures in an eclipse can decrease by more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit 11 degrees Celsius 5They described a sense of awe astonishment and even anxiety knowing an eclipse brings certain hazards However they all exercised care to prevent permanent eye damage or eclipse blindness during the eclipse event Safety was made possible because they wore glasses equipped with special filtered lenses that protected their eyes from any potential harm The AnalogyIn the same manner that the very small moon can block the magnificent sun extinguishing its light and warmth a spiritual eclipse can occur when we allow minor and troublesome obstructions those we face in our daily lives to get so close that they block out the magnitude brightness and warmth of the light of Jesus Christ and His gospel Elder Neal A Maxwell took this analogy even further when he stated Even something as small as a man s thumb when held very near the eye can blind him to the very large sun Yet the sun is still there Blindness is brought upon the man by himself When we draw other things too close placing them first we obscure our vision of heaven 6Clearly none of us wants to purposefully obscure our vision of heaven or allow a spiritual eclipse to occur in our lives Let me share some thoughts that may assist us in preventing spiritual eclipse from causing us permanent spiritual damage Gospel Glasses Maintain a Gospel PerspectiveDo you recall my description of special eyewear used to protect those viewing a solar eclipse from eye damage or even eclipse blindness Looking at a spiritual eclipse through the protecting and softening lens of the Spirit provides a gospel perspective thus protecting us from spiritual blindness Let s consider some examples With the words of the prophets in our hearts and the Holy Spirit as our counselor we can gaze at partially blocked heavenly light through gospel glasses avoiding the harm of a spiritual eclipse So how do we put on gospel glasses Here are some examples Our gospel glasses inform us that the Lord desires that we partake of the sacrament each week and that He desires that we study the scriptures and have daily prayer They also inform us that Satan will tempt us not to We know that his agenda seeks to take away our agency through distractions and worldly temptations Even in Job s day perhaps there were some experiencing a spiritual eclipse described as They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope in the noonday as in the night 7Brothers and sisters when I speak of seeing through gospel glasses please know that I am not suggesting that we do not acknowledge or discuss the challenges we face or that we walk blissfully ignorant of the traps and evils the enemy has placed before us I am not speaking of wearing blinders but just the opposite I am suggesting that we look at challenges through the lens of the gospel Elder Dallin H Oaks observed that perspective is the ability to see all relevant information in a meaningful relationship 8 A gospel perspective expands our sight to an eternal view When you put on gospel glasses you find enhanced perspective focus and vision in the way you think about your priorities your problems your temptations and even your mistakes You will see brighter light that you could not see without them Ironically it is not only the negative that can cause spiritual eclipse in our lives Often admirable or positive endeavors to which we dedicate ourselves can be drawn so close that they blot out gospel light and bring darkness These dangers or distractions could include education and prosperity power and influence ambition even talents and gifts President Dieter F Uchtdorf has taught that any virtue when taken to an extreme can become a vice There comes a point where milestones can become millstones and ambitions albatrosses around our necks 9Let me share in greater detail examples that could become catalysts for avoiding our own spiritual eclipses Social MediaA few months ago I spoke at BYU Women s Conference 10 I described how technology including social media facilitates spreading the knowledge of a Savior throughout every nation kindred tongue and people 11 These technologies include Church websites like LDS org and Mormon org mobile apps such as Gospel Library Mormon Channel LDS Tools and Family Tree and social media platforms including Facebook Instagram Twitter and Pinterest These modalities have generated hundreds of millions of likes shares views retweets and pins and have become very effective and efficient in sharing the gospel with family friends and associates All of the virtues and appropriate use of these technologies notwithstanding there are risks associated with them that when drawn too close can put us in a spiritual eclipse and potentially block the brightness and warmth of the gospel The use of social media mobile apps and games can be inordinately time consuming and can reduce face to face interaction This loss of personal conversation can affect marriages take the place of valuable spiritual practices and stifle the development of social skills especially among youth Two additional risks related to social media are idealized reality and debilitating comparisons Many if not most of the pictures posted on social media tend to portray life at its very best often unrealistically We have all seen beautiful images of home decor wonderful vacation spots smiling selfies elaborate food preparation and seemingly unattainable body images Here for example is an image that you might see on someone s social media account However it doesn t quite capture the full picture of what is actually going on in real life Comparing our own seemingly average existence with others well edited perfectly crafted lives as represented on social media may leave us with feelings of discouragement envy and even failure One person who has shared numerous posts of her own said perhaps only partly in jest What s the point of being happy if you re not going to post it 12As Sister Bonnie L Oscarson reminded us this morning success in life doesn t come down to how many likes we get or how many social media friends or followers we have It does however have something to do with meaningfully connecting with others and adding light to their lives Hopefully we can learn to be more real find more humor and experience less discouragement when confronted with images that may portray idealized reality and that too often lead to debilitating comparisons Comparison apparently is not just a sign of our times but was in times past as well The Apostle Paul warned the people of his day that they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise 13With so many appropriate and inspired uses of technology let us use it to teach inspire and lift ourselves and to encourage others to become their finest rather than to portray our idealized virtual selves Let us also teach and demonstrate the righteous use of technology to the rising generation and warn against the associated hazards and destructive use of it Viewing social media through the lens of the gospel can prevent it from becoming a spiritual eclipse in our lives PrideLet s now address the age old stumbling block of pride Pride is the opposite of humility which is a willingness to submit to the will of the Lord 14 When prideful we tend to take honor to ourselves rather than giving it to others including the Lord Pride is often competitive it is a tendency to seek to obtain more and presume we are better than others Pride often results in feelings of anger and hatred it causes one to hold grudges or to withhold forgiveness Pride however can be swallowed in the Christlike attribute of humility Relationships even with close family and loved ones especially with close family and loved ones even between husbands and wives are fostered in humility and are stymied by pride Many years ago an executive of a large retailer called me to talk about his company which was being bought out by one of its competitors He and numerous other headquarters personnel were extremely anxious that they might lose their jobs Knowing that I was well acquainted with senior management of the acquiring company he asked if I would be willing to both introduce him and give a strong reference on his behalf even to arrange a meeting for him He then concluded with the following statement You know what they say The meek shall perish I understood his comment was more than likely intended as humor I got the joke But there was an important principle that I felt might ultimately be of use to him I replied Actually that isn t what they say In fact it is just the opposite The meek shall inherit the earth 15 is what they say In my experience in the Church as well as throughout my professional career some of the greatest most effective people I have known have been among the most meek and humble Humility and meekness fit hand in glove May we remember that none is acceptable before God save the meek and lowly in heart 16I pray that we will strive to avoid the spiritual eclipse of pride by embracing the virtue of humility ConclusionIn conclusion a solar eclipse is indeed a remarkable phenomenon of nature during which the beauty warmth and light of the sun can be completely covered by a comparatively insignificant object causing darkness and chill A similar phenomenon can be replicated in a spiritual sense when otherwise small and insignificant matters are drawn too close and block the beauty warmth and heavenly light of the gospel of Jesus Christ replacing it with cold darkness Eyewear designed to protect the sight of those in the zone of a total solar eclipse can prevent permanent damage and even blindness 17 Gospel glasses comprised of a knowledge and testimony of gospel principles and ordinances provide a gospel perspective that can similarly provide greater spiritual protection and clarity for someone exposed to the hazards of a spiritual eclipse If you discover anything that seems to be blocking the light and joy of the gospel in your life I invite you to place it in a gospel perspective Look through a gospel lens and be vigilant not to allow insignificant and inconsequential matters in life to obscure your eternal view of the great plan of happiness In short don t let life s distractions eclipse heaven s light TestimonyI bear testimony that no matter the obstruction that may block our vision of gospel light the light is still there That source of warmth truth and brightness is the gospel of Jesus Christ I bear testimony of a loving Heavenly Father of His Son Jesus Christ and of the Son s role as our Savior and Redeemer In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On a Monday evening not long ago my wife Lesa and I stopped by the home of a young family in our neighborhood While we were there the family invited us to stay for family home evening telling us their nine year old son had prepared the lesson Of course we stayed Following the opening song prayer and family business the nine year old began by reading an insightful question included in his handwritten lesson How does the Holy Ghost help you This question began a meaningful family discussion as everyone shared ideas and insights I was impressed by our teacher s lesson preparation and his very good question which stirred in me over and over again Since then I have continued to ask myself How does the Holy Ghost help you a question especially relevant for Primary children turning eight and preparing for baptism and for those children who have recently been baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost It is also relevant for the thousands of recent converts I invite each of us especially Primary children to consider How does the Holy Ghost help you As I pondered this question I immediately reflected upon an experience from my youth This is a story I related to Elder Robert D Hales shortly after my call to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and which he included in a Church magazine article he wrote about my life 1 Some of you may have heard this story but many may not have When I was about 11 years old my father and I went hiking on a hot summer day in the mountains near our home As Dad hiked up the steep trail I jumped from one large rock to another along the sides of the trail Intending to climb one of the large rocks I began to clamber to the top of it As I did so I was surprised when my dad grabbed me by my belt and quickly pulled me down saying Don t climb on that rock Let s just keep on the trail Minutes later as we looked down from higher up the trail we were stunned as we saw a big rattlesnake basking in the sun on top of the very rock I had intended to climb Later as we were driving home I knew Dad was waiting for me to ask How did you know the snake was there So I asked and my question led to a discussion about the Holy Ghost and how the Holy Ghost can help us I have never forgotten what I learned that day Can you see how the Holy Ghost helped me I am forever grateful that my father listened to the still small voice of the Holy Ghost as it may have saved my life What We Know about the Holy GhostBefore we further consider the question How does the Holy Ghost help you let s review some of what the Lord has revealed about the Holy Ghost There are many eternal truths we could look at but today I will highlight just three First the Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead We learn this truth in the first article of faith We believe in God the Eternal Father and in His Son Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost 2Second the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit as described in modern scripture The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man s the Son also but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones but is a personage of Spirit Were it not so the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us 3 This means that the Holy Ghost has a spirit body unlike God the Father and Jesus Christ who have physical bodies This truth clarifies other names given to the Holy Ghost and familiar to us including Holy Spirit Spirit of God Spirit of the Lord Holy Spirit of Promise and Comforter 4Third the gift of the Holy Ghost comes by the laying on of hands This ordinance following baptism qualifies us for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost 5 To perform this ordinance worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders place their hands upon the head of the individual 6 call him or her by name state their priesthood authority and in the name of Jesus Christ confirm him or her a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and utter the important phrase Receive the Holy Ghost How Does the Holy Ghost Help You With that simple review of three key truths about the Holy Ghost we return to our first question How does the Holy Ghost help you The Holy Ghost WarnsAs I described in my childhood experience the Holy Ghost can help you by warning you in advance of physical and spiritual dangers I learned again of the important warning role of the Holy Ghost while I served in the Area Presidency in Japan During this time I worked closely with President Reid Tateoka of the Japan Sendai Mission As part of his usual mission routine President Tateoka planned a meeting for missionary leaders in the southern portion of his mission A few days prior to the meeting President Tateoka had an impression a feeling in his heart to invite all missionaries of that zone to the leadership meeting instead of the prescribed small number of elder and sister leaders When he announced his intention he was reminded that this meeting was not designed for all missionaries but only for mission leaders However setting convention aside in order to follow the prompting he had received he invited all missionaries serving in several coastal cities including the city of Fukushima to the meeting On the appointed day March 11 2011 the missionaries gathered together for the expanded mission meeting in the inland city of Koriyama During this meeting a 9 0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami struck the region of Japan where the Japan Sendai Mission is located Tragically many coastal cities including those from which the missionaries had been gathered were devastated and suffered great loss of life And the city of Fukushima suffered a subsequent nuclear event Although the meetinghouse where the missionaries were meeting that day was damaged by the earthquake through following the promptings of the Holy Ghost President and Sister Tateoka and all missionaries were safely assembled They were out of harm s way and miles from the devastation of the tsunami and the nuclear fallout As you heed promptings from the Holy Ghost impressions most often quiet and still you may be removed without ever knowing from spiritual and temporal danger Brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost will help you by warning you as He did my father and President Tateoka The Holy Ghost ComfortsTo continue answering the question How does the Holy Ghost help you let s now explore His role as Comforter Unexpected events in all our lives cause sadness pain and disappointment Yet amid these trials the Holy Ghost serves us in one of His important roles as Comforter which is actually one of His names These peaceful reassuring words from Jesus Christ describe this sacred role I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever 7To illustrate this further I share the true account of a family with five sons who moved from Los Angeles California USA to a small community some years ago The two oldest sons began playing high school sports and associating with friends leaders and coaches many of whom were faithful members of the Church These relationships helped lead to the baptism of Fernando the oldest and his next younger brother Fernando later moved away from home where he continued his education and played college football He married his high school sweetheart Bayley in the temple As Fernando and Bayley finished their schooling they eagerly anticipated the birth of their first child a baby girl But during the process of their families helping to move Fernando and Bayley back home Bayley and her sister were driving on the freeway and were in a tragic accident involving many vehicles Bayley and her unborn daughter lost their lives Yet as deep as was Fernando s pain as well as that of Bayley s parents and siblings so too was the depth of contrasting peace and comfort that distilled upon them almost immediately The Holy Ghost in His role as Comforter truly sustained Fernando through this incomprehensible affliction The Spirit communicated an abiding peace that led Fernando to an attitude of forgiveness and love toward everyone involved in the tragic crash Bayley s parents called her brother who was serving as a missionary at the time of the accident He described in a letter his feelings upon hearing the difficult news of his beloved sister It was amazing to hear your voices so calm in the midst of a tempest I did not know what to say All I could think of is my sister may not be there when I come home I was comforted by your infallible testimonies of the Savior and His plan The same sweet spirit that brings me to the verge of tears as I study and teach filled my heart I was then comforted and reminded of the things that I know 8The Holy Ghost will help you by comforting you as He did Fernando and Bayley s family The Holy Ghost TestifiesThe Holy Ghost also testifies and bears witness of the Father and the Son and of all truth 9 The Lord speaking to His disciples said But when the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father he shall testify of me 10In order to describe the valuable role of the Holy Ghost as witness I will continue the story of Fernando and Bayley If you remember I shared that Fernando and his brother had been baptized but his parents and three younger brothers had not And despite receiving numerous invitations to meet with the missionaries over the years each time the family declined Upon the painful passing of Bayley and her baby daughter Fernando s family was inconsolable Unlike Fernando and unlike Bayley s family they found no comfort or peace They could not understand how their own son along with Bayley s family could bear their heavy burden Eventually they concluded that what their son possessed and they did not was the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and this must be his source of peace and comfort Following this realization they invited the missionaries to teach their family the gospel As a result they received their own witness and testimony of the great plan of happiness which brought them the sweet peace and calming comfort they were desperately seeking Two months after the loss of Bayley and their unborn granddaughter Fernando s parents as well as two of his younger brothers were baptized and confirmed and received the gift of the Holy Ghost Fernando s youngest brother looks forward to his baptism when he turns eight They each testify that the Spirit the Holy Ghost bore witness of the truthfulness of the gospel leading them to a desire to be baptized and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost will help you by testifying to you as He did to Fernando s family SummaryLet s now summarize We have identified three revealed truths that bring us to a knowledge of the Holy Ghost These are that the Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit and the gift of the Holy Ghost comes by the laying on of hands We also identified three answers to the question How does the Holy Ghost help you The Holy Ghost warns the Holy Ghost comforts and the Holy Ghost testifies Worthiness to Keep the GiftFor those of you who are preparing to be baptized and confirmed those who recently have been or even those who were a long time ago it is vital to our physical and spiritual safety that we keep the gift of the Holy Ghost We begin to do so by striving to keep the commandments having individual and family prayer reading the scriptures and seeking loving and forgiving relationships with family and loved ones We should keep our thoughts actions and language virtuous We should worship our Heavenly Father in our homes at church and whenever possible in the holy temple Stay close to the Spirit and the Spirit will stay close to you TestimonyI now close with an invitation and my sure testimony I invite you to more fully live the words sung so often by our Primary children words I am sure they recognize Listen listen The Holy Ghost will whisper Listen listen to the still small voice 11My dear brothers and sisters old and young I offer my witness of the glorious existence of the divine beings who constitute the Godhead God the Father Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost I bear testimony that one of the privileges we enjoy as Latter day Saints living in the fulness of times is the gift of the Holy Ghost I know that the Holy Ghost does and will help you I also add my special witness of Jesus Christ and His role as our Savior and Redeemer and of God as our Heavenly Father In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Mary Elizabeth RollinsIn my mind I imagine you of the rising generation watching or listening to this conference session somewhere in the world I d like to share a true story with you a story that can be both an example and a lesson It can show you how to get closer to the Lord and access greater power to resist temptation This is a story of a young girl living in New York who before age three lost her father when his boat sank on a large lake She her mother older brother and younger sister moved to a new city in another state to live with her aunt and uncle Sometime after the family arrived missionaries and members of a newly organized religion came to their town with the glorious news of the Restoration of the gospel They told a remarkable story of an angel delivering an ancient record to a young man named Joseph Smith a record he had translated by the power of God Two of the visitors Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had actually seen the engraved metal pages of the ancient record with their own eyes and Whitmer witnessed he had held the golden plates in his own hands This record had been recently published and Brother Whitmer brought the book with him The name of the book of course was the Book of Mormon When 12 year old Mary heard the missionaries speak about the book she had a special feeling in her heart Even though the Book of Mormon was thick with many pages Mary yearned to read it When Brother Whitmer departed he gave one precious copy of the book to Brother Isaac Morley who was a friend of Mary s uncle and a local leader in the new church Mary later recorded I went to Brother Morley s house and asked to see the Book he put it in my hand and as I looked at it I felt such a desire to read it that I could not refrain from asking him to let me take it home and read it He said he had hardly had time to read a chapter in it himself and but few of the brethren had even seen it but I plead so earnestly for it he finally said child if you will bring this book home before breakfast tomorrow morning you may take it Mary ran home and was so captured by the book that she stayed up nearly all night reading it The next morning when she returned the book Brother Morley said I guess you did not read much in it and I don t believe you can tell me one word of it Mary stood up straight and repeated from memory the first verse of the Book of Mormon She then told him the story of the prophet Nephi Mary later wrote He gazed at me in surprise and said child take this book home and finish it I can wait A short time later Mary finished reading the book and was the first person in her town to read the entire book She knew it was true and that it came from Heavenly Father As she looked to the book she looked to the Lord One month later a special visitor came to her house Here is what Mary wrote about her memorable encounter that day When Joseph Smith saw me he looked at me so earnestly After a moment or two he gave me a great blessing and made me a present of the book and said he would give Brother Morley another copy We all felt that he was a man of God for he spoke with power and as one having authority This young girl Mary Elizabeth Rollins saw many other miracles in her life and always kept her testimony of the Book of Mormon 1 This story has special meaning to me because she is my fourth great aunt Through Mary s example along with other experiences in my life I have learned that one is never too young to seek and receive a personal testimony of the Book of Mormon The Keystone of Your TestimonyThere is a personal lesson for you in Mary s story Each of you young men young women and children can have the same feelings she had When you read the Book of Mormon and pray with a desire to know it is true you too can receive the same impression in your heart that Mary received You may also find that as you stand and bear witness of the Book of Mormon you will feel the same spirit of confirmation The Holy Ghost will speak to your heart You can also feel this same spirit of confirmation when you hear others share their testimonies of the Book of Mormon Each of these spiritual witnesses can lead to the Book of Mormon becoming the keystone of your testimony Let me explain The Prophet Joseph Smith who translated the Book of Mormon through the gift and power of God described the Book of Mormon as the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion 2Since the Book of Mormon s first printing in 1830 more than 174 million copies have been published in 110 different languages demonstrating that the Book of Mormon is still the keystone of our religion But what does this mean for each of you In architectural terms a keystone is a main element in an arched gateway It is the wedge shaped stone in the very center and at the highest point of an arch It is the most important of the stones because it keeps the sides of the arch in place preventing collapse And it is the structural element that ensures the gate or opening below is passable In gospel terms it is a gift and blessing from the Lord that the keystone of our religion is something as tangible and graspable as the Book of Mormon and that you can hold it and read it Can you see the Book of Mormon as your keystone your spiritual center of strength President Ezra Taft Benson expanded on those teachings of Joseph Smith He said There are three ways in which the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion It is the keystone in our witness of Christ It is the keystone of our doctrine It is the keystone of testimony President Benson further taught The Book of Mormon teaches us truth and bears testimony of Christ But there is something more There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book You will find greater power to resist temptation You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path 3My Personal WitnessIn my case the Book of Mormon became the keystone of my testimony over a period of years and through a number of experiences One powerful experience in forming my testimony occurred while I was a young missionary serving in my first area Kumamoto Japan My companion and I were house to house proselyting I met a grandmother who kindly invited us into the entry of her home which is called a genkan in Japanese She offered us a cold drink on a hot day I had not been in Japan very long and I had recently completed reading the Book of Mormon and had been praying to know with certainty that it was true Because of my newness to Japan I didn t speak Japanese very well In fact I don t think this woman understood much of what I was saying I began teaching her about the Book of Mormon describing how Joseph Smith received from an angel an ancient record engraved on plates and how he translated them by the power of God As I offered her my testimony that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and another testament of Jesus Christ I received the strongest impression accompanied by a warm feeling of comfort and serenity inside my chest which the scriptures describe as your bosom burning within you 4 This feeling reaffirmed to me in a powerful way that the Book of Mormon truly is the word of God At that time my feelings were so strong that tears came to my eyes as I talked to this Japanese grandmother I have never forgotten the special feeling of that day Your Personal WitnessEach of you can also receive a personal witness of this book Do you realize that the Book of Mormon was written for you and for your day This book is one of the blessings of living in what we call the dispensation of the fulness of times Although the Book of Mormon was written by inspired ancient authors many of whom were prophets they and the people of their day did not have the benefit of possessing the whole book You now have easily within your reach the sacred record that prophets priests and kings treasured embraced and preserved You have the benefit of holding in your hands the complete Book of Mormon Interestingly one of the Book of Mormon prophets Moroni saw our day your day He even saw you in vision many hundreds of years ago Moroni wrote Behold the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that day when these things meaning the Book of Mormon shall come forth among you Behold I speak unto you as if ye were present and yet ye are not But behold Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me and I know your doing 5In order to help the Book of Mormon become the keystone of your testimony I offer you a challenge I recently learned that many young people spend an average of seven hours a day looking at TV computer and smartphone screens 6 With this in mind would you make a small change Will you replace some of that daily screen time particularly that devoted to social media the internet gaming or television with reading the Book of Mormon If the studies I referred to are accurate you could easily find time for daily study of the Book of Mormon even if for only 10 minutes a day And you can study in a way that allows you to enjoy it and understand it either on your device or in book form President Russell M Nelson recently cautioned We should never make reading the Book of Mormon seem like an onerous duty like the gulping of nasty medicine to be swallowed quickly and then checked off with finality 7For some of you younger children you might read it with a parent grandparent or loved one If a chapter verse or portion becomes difficult enough to discourage your reading move on to the next and the next I picture you following the example of Mary I picture you excitedly finding time and a quiet place to read the Book of Mormon I see you discovering answers feeling guidance and gaining your own testimony of the Book of Mormon and a testimony of Jesus Christ As you look to the book you look to the Lord You will pore through the passages of this precious book and encounter your beloved Savior the Lord Jesus Christ on nearly every page It is estimated that some form of His name is used an average of once every 1 7 verses 8 Even Christ Himself testified of its truthfulness in these the latter days stating As your Lord and your God liveth it is true 9I am grateful for the invitation and promise that the Lord has offered through the prophet Moroni to each of you and to everyone who reads the Book of Mormon I close by reading this invitation and promise and adding my testimony And when ye shall receive these things the Book of Mormon I would exhort you that ye would ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Jesus Christ if these things are not true and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost 10I bear testimony of the Restoration of the gospel in these latter days and of the Book of Mormon as tangible evidence of that Restoration Just as the words of this book inspired a 12 year old girl to embrace the restored Church of Jesus Christ nearly two centuries ago the truths you will find there will uplift and inspire you in a similar way They will strengthen your faith fill your soul with light and prepare you for a future you scarcely have the ability to comprehend Within the book s pages you will discover the infinite love and incomprehensible grace of God As you strive to follow the teachings you find there your joy will expand your understanding will increase and the answers you seek to the many challenges mortality presents will be opened to you As you look to the book you look to the Lord The Book of Mormon is the revealed word of God Of this I testify with all my heart and soul in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As the winter afternoon sun slid behind the expansive snow covered ski hill the freezing mountain air sharply bit our cheeks and noses acting almost like a stern usher instructing us to find our cars and trucks in the ski resort parking lot There in our comfortable cars heaters would soon warm cold fingers and toes The sound of the frozen snow crunching with each step we took confirmed that this was extreme cold Our family had enjoyed a fun filled day on the ski slopes which was now coming to a frosty close Arriving at the car I reached in my coat pocket for the keys and then another pocket and another Where are the keys Everyone was anxiously waiting on the keys The car battery was charged and all the systems including the heater were ready to go but without the keys locked doors would deny entrance without the keys the engine would not provide power to the vehicle At the time our primary focus was on how we were going to get into the car and get warm but I couldn t help but think even then there just might be a lesson here Without keys this wonderful miracle of engineering was little more than plastic and metal Even though the car had great potential without keys it could not perform its intended function The more I reflect on this experience the more profound this analogy has become to me I marvel at Heavenly Father s love for His children I stand in wonder at the heavenly visitation and the grand visions of eternity God bestowed upon Joseph Smith And in particular my heart is filled with overwhelming gratitude for the restoration of priesthood authority and priesthood keys Without this restoration we would be locked out from the vehicle necessary to transport us on our journey home to loving heavenly parents The performance of every ordinance of salvation comprising our covenant pathway back to the presence of our Father in Heaven requires appropriate governance through priesthood keys In May of 1829 John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery conferred upon them the Aaronic Priesthood and bestowed upon them the keys attendant to that priesthood Soon thereafter Peter James and John conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood keys 1Nearly seven years later on a Sunday in the Kirtland Temple just one week following its dedication the Lord Jehovah appears in glory to Joseph and Oliver an event followed by the appearance of Moses Elias and Elijah who committed their keys and dispensations 2 The restored priesthood authority and these keys had been lost for centuries In the same way that our family was locked out of the car resulting from lost car keys so too had all of Heavenly Father s children been locked out from the saving ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ until a divine restoration was effected by these heavenly messengers Never ever again do we have to question Where are the keys On a beautiful fall day last year I visited the peaceful forest located in northeastern Pennsylvania known in scripture as Harmony where John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and restored the Aaronic Priesthood I also stood on the banks of the Susquehanna River where Joseph and Oliver endowed with authority and keys were baptized Near this same river Peter James and John appeared and restored the Melchizedek Priesthood and its attendant keys 3These sites as well as the reconstructed first home of Joseph and Emma where most of the Book of Mormon was translated the nearby home of Emma s parents and a visitors center incorporated into a new meetinghouse comprise the new Priesthood Restoration Site dedicated by President Russell M Nelson in September of last year There I felt the power and reality of the heavenly events which took place on that sacred ground That experience led me to ponder study and pray about priesthood authority and priesthood keys which impressed me with a desire to share with the young men and young women of the Church how priesthood authority and restored keys can bless them First an understanding of these terms may be helpful The priesthood or priesthood authority has been defined as the power and authority of God 4 and the consummate power on this earth 5 Priesthood keys are defined for our understanding as well Priesthood keys are the authority God has given to priesthood leaders to direct control and govern the use of His priesthood on earth 6 Priesthood keys control the exercise of priesthood authority Ordinances that create a record in the Church require keys and cannot be done without authorization Elder Dallin H Oaks taught that ultimately all keys of the priesthood are held by the Lord Jesus Christ whose priesthood it is He is the one who determines what keys are delegated to mortals and how those keys will be used 7Now for you young men and young women I have considered three ways that you can find the keys or use priesthood keys and authority to bless your life and the lives of others The First Is to Prepare for Missionary ServiceMy young brothers and sisters you may not realize it but the keys of the gathering of Israel restored by Moses enable missionary work in our dispensation Consider the full time missionary force of approximately 75 000 laboring in the field under the direction of these keys With this in mind remember it is never too early for you to prepare for missionary service In For the Strength of Youth we read Young men of the Aaronic Priesthood work diligently to prepare yourself to represent the Lord as a missionary 8 Young women can prepare also but you are not under the same mandate to serve 9 All of your preparation however whether you serve as a full time missionary or not will accrue lifelong benefits to you as a member missionary The Second Way to Find the Keys Is to Attend the TempleSealing keys restored by the Old Testament prophet Elijah enable ordinances to take place in holy temples Ordinances performed in these temples enable individuals and families to return to the presence of our heavenly parents We encourage you young men and young women to research and find the names of your ancestors and perform proxy baptisms for them in the temple We note that this is already taking place in significant and unprecedented numbers throughout the world Baptistries in many temples are filled with young men and young women early in the morning and into the night Keys are turned that allow families to be bound together as sacred ordinances are performed in these temples Can you see the relationship between priesthood keys and blessings As you engage in this work I think you will find that the Lord is in its details An experience demonstrates this I recently learned of a mother who regularly escorted her children to the temple to perform proxy baptisms On this particular day as this family completed their baptisms and were leaving the temple a man entered the baptistry area with a large batch of his own family names Realizing there was no one remaining in the baptistry to assist with these family names a temple worker caught the departing family and asked the children if they would consider reentering and changing once again to assist with these baptisms They willingly agreed and went back in As the children were baptized their mother listening began to recognize the names and soon to the amazement of all realized the man s batch of family names were deceased ancestors of her family as well A sweet tender mercy for them Two weeks ago the Provo City Center Temple was dedicated as the 150th operating temple of the Church worldwide We note that when President Thomas S Monson was sustained as an Apostle in 1963 there were 12 operating temples in the Church Temples are getting closer and closer to you However for those of you who live where distance or circumstances do not allow regular temple attendance you should always keep yourself worthy to attend You can do important work outside of temples as you research and submit your family names Finally Number Three Go Forward with FaithThe Old Testament prophet Abraham received a great blessing from the Lord in his dispensation sometimes referred to as the Abrahamic covenant Thousands of years later the blessings of the dispensation of the gospel to Abraham were restored This occurred when the prophet Elias appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple Through this restoration each of you has access to the great blessings promised to Abraham These blessings can be yours if you remain faithful and live worthy In the pamphlet For the Strength of Youth you are given some very practical instruction about how to go forward with faith I summarize some of that counsel To help you become all that the Lord wants you to become kneel each morning and night in prayer to your Father in Heaven Study the scriptures each day and apply what you read to your life Strive each day to be obedient In all circumstances follow the teachings of the prophets Be humble and willing to listen to the Holy Ghost This counsel is followed by a promise leading to promises that come through the blessings of Abraham As you do these things the Lord will make much more out of your life than you can by yourself He will increase your opportunities expand your vision and strengthen you He will give you the help you need to meet your trials and challenges You will gain a stronger testimony and find true joy as you come to know your Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ and feel Their love for you 10To summarize prepare for missionary service attend the temple and go forward with faith ConclusionLet s now end where we began stranded in the frigid parking lot asking Where are the keys By the way later that evening I did miraculously find the keys that had fallen out of my pocket on the mountain The Lord has shown us that He will not leave us standing in the bitter cold without keys or authority to lead us safely home to Him If you are like me you may often find yourself in daily life asking Where are the keys to the car the office the house or apartment When this happens to me I can t help but smile inside for as I am looking for the keys I find myself reflecting on restored priesthood keys and on President Thomas S Monson whom we sustain as prophet seer and revelator 11 and as the only person on earth who possesses and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys Yes the keys are safely in the possession of prophets seers and revelators They are conferred delegated and assigned to others in accordance with the Lord s will under the direction of the President of the Church I testify that priesthood authority and priesthood keys start the engine open the gates of heaven facilitate heavenly power and pave the covenant pathway back to our loving Heavenly Father I pray that you the rising generation of young men and young women will press forward with a steadfastness in Christ 12 that you may understand that it is your sacred privilege to act under the direction of those who hold the priesthood keys that will unlock blessings gifts and powers of heaven for you I testify of God the Father of our Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ of the Holy Ghost and of the Restoration of the gospel in these the latter days in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters it has been many decades since a general conference has been convened that President Boyd K Packer and Elders L Tom Perry and Richard G Scott were not seated immediately behind the podium and speaking at one of these sessions Our memories of them are poignant and I add my tribute to honor them each so uniquely different yet so harmonized in their witness and testimony of Jesus Christ and His Atonement Furthermore I like you find strength in and sustain President Thomas S Monson as prophet seer and revelator and I marvel at his faithful and dutiful apostolic service spanning over 50 remarkable years And so it was on Tuesday morning of this week just after 9 00 a m as the Bishopric was beginning a meeting with the Asia Area Presidency who are here for conference that I was called to meet with President Monson along with his counselors Moments later as I walked into the boardroom adjacent to his office I must have looked nervous sitting across the table as he kindly spoke to calm my nerves He commented noting my age that I seemed quite young and even looked younger than my age Then within a few moments President Monson described that acting on the will of the Lord he was extending a call to the Quorum of the Twelve to me He asked me if I would accept this call to which following what I am sure was a very undignified audible gasp in complete shock I responded affirmatively And then before I could even verbalize a tsunami of indescribable emotion most of which were feelings of inadequacy President Monson kindly reached out to me describing how he was called many years ago as an Apostle by President David O McKay at which time he too felt inadequate He calmly instructed me Bishop Stevenson the Lord will qualify those whom He calls These soothing words of a prophet have been a source of peace a calm in a storm of painful self examination and tender feelings in the ensuing agonizing hours which have passed day and night since then I rehearsed what I have just described to you to my sweet companion Lesa later that day seated in a quiet corner on Temple Square with a serene view of the temple and the historic Tabernacle lying before us As we tried to comprehend and process the events of the day we found our anchor to be our faith in Jesus Christ and our knowledge of the great plan of happiness This leads to an expression of my deepest love for Lesa She is the sunshine in and of my life and a remarkable daughter of God Hers is a life punctuated by selfless service and unconditional love of all I will strive to remain worthy of the blessing of our eternal union I express my deepest love to our four sons and their families three of whom are here with their beautiful wives the mothers of our six grandchildren the fourth a missionary has special permission to stay up past missionary curfew and is viewing these proceedings live with his mission president and the mission president s wife from their mission home in Taiwan I love each of them and love how they love the Savior and the gospel I express my love to each member of my family to my dear mother and to my father who passed away last year who instilled in me a testimony which seemed to dwell in me from my earliest memories I further extend this gratitude to my brother sisters and their faithful spouses as well as Lesa s family many of whom are actually here today I cast this net of gratitude to numerous extended family friends missionaries leaders and teachers along the way I have been blessed with a close association with the members of the First Presidency the Twelve the Seventy and the general auxiliary presidencies I express my love and esteem to each of you sisters and brothers and will strive to be worthy of our continued association The Presiding Bishopric enjoys an almost heavenly unity I will miss my association each day with Bishop G rald Causs Bishop Dean M Davies and the staff I stand before you as evidence of the words of the Lord recorded in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants That the fulness of the gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the earth and before kings and rulers 1 These words are preceded by the Lord s declaration which demonstrates the love of a Father for His children Wherefore I the Lord knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth called upon my servant Joseph Smith Jun and spake unto him from heaven and gave him commandments 2Our loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jehovah with a knowledge of the end from the beginning 3 opened the heavens and a new dispensation to offset the calamities that They knew would come The Apostle Paul described the forthcoming calamities as perilous times 4 For me this suggests that Heavenly Father s generous compensation for living in perilous times is that we also live in the fulness of times As I agonized over my inadequacies this week I received a distinct impression which both chastened and comforted me to focus not on what I can t do but rather on what I can do I can testify of the plain and precious truths of the gospel These are the words which I have shared hundreds of times with both those who belong to the Church and many who are not members God is our loving Heavenly Father We are His children He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right He wants to communicate with us and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer Heavenly Father has provided us His children with a way to return to live in His presence Central to our Heavenly Father s plan is Jesus Christ s Atonement 5Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind Of these plain and precious truths I bear my testimony and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The recent Olympic Winter Games enthralled the world as athletes representing 89 countries competed in 98 different events Remarkably 10 of these athletes were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 3 of whom earned medals recently highlighted in the Church News Christopher Fogt Noelle Pikus Pace and Torah Bright 1 We offer our congratulations to all of the athletes who competed Well done I speak of these games this morning directing my thoughts to young men young women and young single adults you who are in your critical years which set the course for your life I feel a great sense of urgency in addressing you For you to feel that urgency I first share the story of Noelle Pikus Pace one of those Latter day Saint athletes In Noelle s event the skeleton athletes build momentum as they sprint and then plunge headfirst on a small sled With their faces inches above the ground they race down a winding icy track at speeds that top 90 miles 145 km an hour Remarkably years of preparation would be considered either a success or a disappointment based on what happened in the space of four intense 60 second runs Noelle s previous 2006 Olympic dreams were dashed when a terrible accident left her with a broken leg In the 2010 Olympics her dreams fell short again when just over one tenth of a second kept her from the medal stand 2Can you imagine the anxiety she felt as she waited to begin her first run in the 2014 Olympics Years of preparation would culminate in only a sliver of time Four minutes total She spent years preparing for those four minutes and would spend a lifetime afterward reflecting on them Noelle s final runs were virtually flawless We will never forget her leap into the stands to embrace her family after crossing the finish line exclaiming We did it Years of preparation had paid off We saw her Young Women medallion around her neck as the silver medal was placed there beside it 3It may seem unfair that Noelle s entire Olympic dreams hinged on what she did during just four brief minutes But she knew it and that is why she prepared so diligently She sensed the magnitude the urgency of her four minutes and what they would mean for the rest of her life We also remember Christopher Fogt a member of the team that won the bronze medal in the four man bobsled race While he could have given up after a devastating crash in the 2010 Olympics he chose to persevere After a fantastic redemptive run he won the prize he so diligently sought 4Now consider how your pathway to eternal life is similar to these athletes four minute performance You are an eternal being Before you were born you existed as a spirit In the presence of a loving Heavenly Father you trained and prepared to come to earth for a brief moment and well perform This life is your four minutes While you are here your actions will determine whether you win the prize of eternal life The prophet Amulek described This life is the time to prepare to meet God yea behold the day of this life is the day to perform your labors 5In a sense your four minutes have already begun The clock is ticking The words of the Apostle Paul seem so fitting to run the race that you may obtain the prize 6In the same way that certain steps are essential in the very brief performance of an Olympic athlete jumps or maneuvers for ice skaters and snowboarders negotiating the turns of a bobsled run or carving through the gates of a downhill slalom course so it is in our lives where certain things are absolutely essential checkpoints which move us through our spiritual performance on earth These spiritual markers are the essential God given ordinances of the gospel baptism receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost priesthood ordinations temple ordinances and partaking of the sacrament each week In the se ordinances the power of godliness is manifest 7And in the same way that the discipline of training prepares an athlete to perform elements in his or her sport at the highest level keeping the commandments will qualify you to receive these saving ordinances Do you sense the urgency My young friends wherever you are in your four minute performance I urge you to ponder What do I need to do next to ensure my medal Perhaps during this conference the Spirit has whispered to you what that may be to prepare more thoughtfully for an ordinance in your future or to receive an ordinance that you should have received a long time ago Whatever it may be do it now Don t wait Your four minutes will pass quickly and you ll have eternity to think about what you did in this life 8Self discipline is needed Daily prayer scripture study and church attendance must be the foundation of your training A consistent pattern of obeying the commandments keeping the covenants you have made and following the Lord s standard found in For the Strength of Youth is required Perhaps you re aware of things in your life that are threatening to slow or stop your spiritual progress If so follow this scriptural counsel Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us 9It is not yet too late to repent But it soon may be because no one really knows when your four minutes will be over Now you may be thinking to yourself I already blew it My four minutes are already a disaster I may as well give up If so stop thinking that and never think it again The miracle of the Atonement can make up for imperfections in our performance As Elder Jeffrey R Holland has taught To those of you who may still be hanging back I testify of the renewing power of God s love and the miracle of His grace It is never too late so long as the Master says there is time Don t delay 10Remember you are not alone The Savior has promised that He will not leave you comfortless 11 You also have family friends and leaders who are cheering you on Although my remarks have been directed to the youth of the Church for parents and grandparents I offer the following Recently Elder David A Bednar described a simple way to conduct a family assessment to mark progress on the covenant path by essential ordinances All that is needed is a piece of paper with two columns name and plan for next or needful ordinance I did this recently listing each family member Among them I noted an infant grandson soon to be blessed a six year old grandson whose preparation for baptism was essential and a son turning 18 whose preparation for the priesthood and temple endowment was imminent Everyone on the list needed the sacrament ordinance This simple exercise assisted Lesa and me in fulfilling our role to help each member of our family along the covenant path with an action plan for each of them Perhaps this is an idea for you which will lead to family discussions family home evening lessons preparation and even invitations for essential ordinances in your family 12As a skier and a snowboarder myself I was deeply impressed with the four minute silver medal winning performance of Australian LDS athlete and snowboarder Torah Bright in the half pipe competition She dazzled the world as she finished a virtually flawless run culminating in a backside rodeo 720 However even more impressive and surprising to the world was the way she reached out and demonstrated Christlike love to her competitors She noticed that American snowboarder Kelly Clark who had a bad first run in her final round appeared to be nervous about her second run She gave me a hug Clark recalls She just held me until I actually calmed down enough and I slowed my breathing It was good to have a hug from a friend Kelly Clark would later join Torah on the winners podium as a bronze medalist When asked about this unusual act of kindness toward her opponent which could have put her own silver medal at risk Torah simply said I am a competitor I want to do my best but I want my fellow competitors to do their best too 13With that in mind is there someone who needs your encouragement a family member a friend a classmate or fellow quorum member How can you help them with their four minutes Dear friends you are in the midst of an exhilarating journey In some ways you are racing down the half pipe or sled track and it can be challenging to perform each element or navigate each turn along the way But remember you ve prepared for this for millennia This is your moment to perform This is your four minutes The time is now I express my utmost confidence in your abilities You have the Savior of the world on your side If you seek His help and follow His directions how can you fail I conclude with my testimony of the blessing we have in a living prophet President Thomas S Monson and of Jesus Christ and His role as our Savior and Redeemer in His holy name Jesus Christ amen 
Tonight I feel especially blessed to speak as a bishop to the young men holders of the Aaronic Priesthood gathered from around the world for this general priesthood meeting I share with you narrative from the Book of Mormon describing Helaman and his 2 000 stripling soldiers This scripture will provide insight into the character of those ancient young men and inspiration for you latter day young men I quote a favorite scripture And they were all young men and they were exceedingly valiant for courage and also for strength and activity but behold this was not all they were men who were true at all times 1 Courage strength activity and truth what admirable traits I would like to focus on the first trait that describes them valiant for courage To me this describes the conviction of these young men to courageously do what is right or as Alma describes to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all places 2 The 2 000 stripling soldiers had countless moments to demonstrate their courage Each of you will also have defining moments in your life requiring courage A friend of mine John shared with me one of those moments in his life Some years ago John was accepted at a prestigious Japanese university He would be part of the international student program with many other top students from around the world Some enrolled with a hope to deepen their understanding of the culture and language others viewed it as a stepping stone to an eventual profession and employment in Japan but all had left home to study in a foreign country Soon after John s arrival word of a party to be held on the rooftop of a private residence spread among the foreign student population That evening John and two friends made their way to the advertised address Following an elevator ride to the top floor of the building John and his friends navigated the single narrow stairway leading to the rooftop and began mingling with the others As the night wore on the atmosphere changed The noise music volume and alcohol amplified as did John s uneasiness Then suddenly someone began organizing the students into a large circle with the intent of sharing marijuana cigarettes John grimaced and quickly informed his two friends that it was time to leave Almost in ridicule one of them replied John this is easy we ll just stand in the circle and when it is our turn we ll just pass it along rather than smoke it That way we won t have to embarrass ourselves in front of everyone by leaving This sounded easy to John but it did not sound right He knew he had to announce his intention and act In a moment he mustered his courage and told them that they could do as they wished but he was leaving One friend decided to stay and joined the circle the other reluctantly followed John down the stairs to board the elevator Much to their surprise when the elevator doors opened Japanese police officers poured out and hurried to ascend the stairs to the rooftop John and his friend boarded the elevator and departed When the police appeared at the top of the stairs the students quickly threw the illegal drugs off the roof so they wouldn t be caught After securing the stairway however the officers lined up everyone on the roof and asked each student to extend both hands The officers then walked down the line carefully smelling each student s thumbs and index fingers All who had held the marijuana whether they had smoked it or not were presumed guilty and there were huge consequences Almost without exception the students who had remained on the rooftop were expelled from their respective universities and those convicted of a crime were likely deported from Japan Dreams of an education years of preparation and the possibility of future employment in Japan were dashed in a moment Now let me tell you what happened to these three friends The friend who stayed on the roof was expelled from the university in Japan to which he had worked so hard to be accepted and was required to return home The friend who left the party that night with John finished school in Japan and went on to earn degrees from two top tier universities in the United States His career took him back to Asia where he has enjoyed immense professional success He remains grateful to this day for John s courageous example As for John the consequences in his life have been immeasurable His time in Japan that year led him to a happy marriage and the subsequent birth of two sons He has been a very successful businessman and recently became a professor at a Japanese university Imagine how different his life would have been had he not had the courage to leave the party on that important evening in Japan 3Young men there will be times when you like John will have to demonstrate your righteous courage in plain view of your peers the consequence of which may be ridicule and embarrassment Additionally in your world skirmishes with the adversary will also be fought on a silent solitary battlefield in front of a screen Technology with its substantial benefits also brings challenges not faced by generations before you A recent national survey found that today s teens are tempted at alarming levels each day not only in schools but also in cyberspace It revealed that teens who were exposed to images of drinking or drug use on social networking sites were three to four times more likely to use alcohol or drugs Commenting on the survey a former U S cabinet secretary stated This year s survey reveals a new kind of potent peer pressure digital peer pressure Digital peer pressure moves beyond a child s friends and the kids they hang out with It invades the home and a child s bedroom via the Internet 4 The demonstration of righteous courage will often be as subtle as to click or not to click Missionaries are taught from Preach My Gospel What you choose to think and do when you are alone and you believe no one is watching is a strong measure of your virtue 5 Be courageous Be strong Stand ye in holy places and be not moved 6Young men I promise the Lord will empower you For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power 7 He will reward you for your courage and righteous behavior with happiness and joy Such courage will be a byproduct of your faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement your prayers and your obedience to commandments President N Eldon Tanner stated One young boy on the school ground can wield a mighty influence for good One young man on the football team or the campus or among his fellow workers can by living the gospel honoring his priesthood and taking a stand for the right do untold good Often you will experience much criticism and ridicule even by those who believe as you do even though they may respect you for doing right But remember that the Savior himself was tormented ridiculed spat upon and finally crucified because he would not waver in his conviction Have you ever stopped to think what would have happened had he weakened and said Oh what s the use and abandoned his mission Do we want to be quitters or do we want to be valiant servants in spite of all the opposition and evil in the world Let us have the courage to stand up and be counted as true devoted followers of Christ 8I invite you to qualify yourselves as did the 2 000 stripling soldiers by being valiant in courage as worthy priesthood holders Remember what you do where you go and what you see will shape who you become Who do you want to become Become a worthy deacon a worthy teacher a worthy priest Set a goal to be worthy to enter the temple now and to be worthy to receive your next ordinance at the proper age and ultimately to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood This is a pathway of righteousness which invites divine assistance The Lord stated In the ordinances thereof the power of godliness is manifest 9Parents priesthood leaders and prophetic priorities found in your Duty to God and For the Strength of Youth pamphlets will guide you along the way President Thomas S Monson recently counseled To make decisions wisely courage is needed the courage to say no the courage to say yes I plead with you to make a determination right now not to deviate from the path which will lead to our goal eternal life with our Father in Heaven 10Just as the 2 000 soldiers responded to the battle cry of their leader Helaman and marshaled their valiant courage you too can do the same by following your prophet leader President Thomas S Monson My young Aaronic Priesthood holders in closing I offer my testimony of God the Father and Jesus Christ and the words of Joseph Smith Brethren shall we not go on in so great a cause Go forward and not backward Courage brethren and on on to the victory 11 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
What a wonderful conference it has been How blessed we are to hear the counsel of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve whom we sustain as prophets seers and revelators I remember a warm sunny afternoon when spring was trying to nudge its way through a long winter in Cache Valley Utah My father whose Saturdays were always filled with chores for his grandsons stopped by our home with an offer to go for a ride Always happy to ride in Grandpa s truck our four and six year old sons scurried into the back jump seat and I joined my father in the front Our drive took us through the streets of downtown Logan which wrap around the Logan Temple prominently situated on a hill centered beautifully in the city As we moved further away from the city we turned from paved busy streets to seldom used dirt roads where we crossed old bridges and weaved through trees far into the country We were far from any other traffic and all alone Realizing his grandsons were in a place they had not been before my father stopped the truck Do you think we are lost he asked the wide eyed boys as they gazed out the windshield across the valley Followed by a moment of silent assessment came the profound reply of a young child Look he said pointing his finger Grandpa you are never lost when you can see the temple Our eyes turned focusing with his seeing the sun glistening off the spires of the Logan Temple far across the valley You are never lost when you can see the temple The temple will provide direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos It is an eternal guidepost which will help you from getting lost in the mist of darkness 1 It is the house of the Lord 2 It is a place where covenants are made and eternal ordinances are performed In the Book of Mormon King Benjamin directed the Saints of his time and place to gather every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple 3 As Church members we have recently received counsel from modern day prophets which if followed will turn the doors of our homes more fully towards the temple The First Presidency has invited adult members to have a current temple recommend and visit the temple more often where time and circumstance permit and encouraged members to replace some leisure activities with temple service They also encouraged newer members and youth of the Church who are 12 years of age and older to live worthy to assist in this great work by serving as proxies for baptisms and confirmations 4 Even our young children have been encouraged to visit the temple grounds and touch the temple 5 President Thomas S Monson once counseled As we touch the temple the temple will touch us 6We are blessed to live in a temple building dispensation in which 146 temples have been dedicated or announced 7 Under the definition of Temple in the Bible Dictionary we read the following It is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth followed by this insightful statement Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness 8 For me this suggests a sacred relationship between the temple and the home Not only can we turn the doors of our homes to the temple or the house of the Lord we can make our homes a house of the Lord Recently in a stake conference all present were invited by the visiting authority Elder Glen Jenson an Area Seventy to take a virtual tour of their homes using their spiritual eyes I would like to invite each of you to do this also Wherever your home may be and whatever its configuration the application of eternal gospel principles within its walls is universal Let s begin Imagine that you are opening your front door and walking inside your home What do you see and how do you feel Is it a place of love peace and refuge from the world as is the temple Is it clean and orderly As you walk through the rooms of your home do you see uplifting images which include appropriate pictures of the temple and the Savior Is your bedroom or sleeping area a place for personal prayer Is your gathering area or kitchen a place where food is prepared and enjoyed together allowing uplifting conversation and family time Are scriptures found in a room where the family can study pray and learn together Can you find your personal gospel study space Does the music you hear or the entertainment you see online or otherwise offend the Spirit Is the conversation uplifting and without contention That concludes our tour Perhaps you as I found a few spots that need some home improvement hopefully not an extreme home makeover Whether our living space is large or small humble or extravagant there is a place for each of these gospel priorities in each of our homes In order to keep the temple and those who attend it sacred and worthy the Lord has established standards through His servants the prophets We may be well advised to consider together in family council standards for our homes to keep them sacred and to allow them to be a house of the Lord The admonition to establish a house of prayer a house of fasting a house of faith a house of learning a house of glory a house of order a house of God 9 provides divine insight into the type of home the Lord would have us build Doing such begins the construction of a spiritual mansion in which we all may reside regardless of our worldly circumstance a home filled with treasure that neither moth nor rust doth corrupt 10There exists a righteous unity between the temple and the home Understanding the eternal nature of the temple will draw you to your family understanding the eternal nature of the family will draw you to the temple President Howard W Hunter stated In the ordinances of the temple the foundations of the eternal family are sealed in place 11President Boyd K Packer counseled Say the word temple Say it quietly and reverently Say it over and over again Temple Temple Temple Add the word holy Holy Temple Say it as though it were capitalized no matter where it appears in the sentence Temple One other word is equal in importance to a Latter day Saint Home Put the words holy temple and home together and you have described the house of the Lord 12Last year Primary children gathered thousands of them from around the world in each of their wards and branches singing to their families and ward members as part of the Primary sacrament meeting presentation They sang of desire promises and preparation The things of which they sang begin in sacred homes and continue in sacred temples I think you will hear the tune in your hearts as I read the words I love to see the temple I m going there somedayTo feel the Holy Spirit To listen and to pray For the temple is a house of God A place of love and beauty I ll prepare myself while I am young This is my sacred duty I love to see the temple I ll go inside someday I ll cov nant with my Father I ll promise to obey For the temple is a holy placeWhere we are sealed together As a child of God I ve learned this truth A fam ly is forever 13President Boyd K Packer stated The ultimate purpose of all we teach is to unite parents and children in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that they are happy at home sealed in an eternal marriage linked to their generations and assured of exaltation in the presence of our Heavenly Father 14I testify to you that the application of these principles will help turn the doors of your home to the temple or house of the Lord and more fully allow you to make your sacred home a house of the Lord I conclude where I began with the words of an innocent child You are never lost when you can see the temple And I add my testimony of the sacred nature of our homes and of the Lord s temples I know that God is our loving Heavenly Father I bear witness of Jesus Christ and of His role as our Savior and Redeemer and of living prophets authorized to exercise all priesthood keys from Joseph Smith to Thomas S Monson I do so in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen
