My dear brothers and sisters I am honored to speak at this historic general conference commemorating Joseph Smith s First Vision of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ in what is without question a Sacred Grove That vision was a magnificent beginning to the Restoration of the gospel and all that unfolded from the Book of Mormon to the return of priesthood authority and keys the organization of the Lord s true Church temples of God and prophets and apostles who lead the work in these latter days By divine design ancient prophets of God when moved upon by the Holy Ghost prophesied of the Restoration and what was to come in our day the last dispensation and the fulness of times The very work fired the souls of the early seers 1 Through generations of time they foretold dreamed envisioned and prophesied of the future of God s kingdom on earth what Isaiah called a marvellous work and a wonder 2The prophecies that have been fulfilled by the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints are many Today however I will highlight only a few of my favorites These were taught to me by my dear Primary teachers and at the knee of my angel mother Daniel who staved off lions by his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the intercession of God s ministering angels was one who saw our day in vision Interpreting a dream for Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar Daniel prophesied the Lord s Church would rise in the last days as a small stone cut out of the mountain without hands 3 Without hands meaning by divine intervention the Lord s Church would increase in magnitude until it fills the whole earth never to be destroyed but to stand for ever 4It is a profound witness that Daniel s words are being fulfilled as members of the Church from all over the world are watching and listening to the conference today The devoted Apostle Peter described times of restitution of all things since the world began 5 The Apostle Paul wrote that in the fulness of times God would gather in one all things in Christ 6 Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone 7 I felt those prophecies so strongly when I participated in the dedication of the Rome Italy Temple All of the prophets and apostles were there bearing testimony of Jesus Christ the Redeemer of the world as had Peter and Paul The Church is a living example of that restitution brothers and sisters and our members are witnesses of those divine prophecies long ago Joseph of Egypt prophesied that in the latter days a seer shall the Lord my God raise up who shall be a choice seer unto the fruit of my loins 8 For he shall do the Lord s work 9 Joseph Smith the prophet of the Restoration was that seer John the Revelator prophesied of an angel of the Almighty bringing together important elements of the Restoration with these words And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people 10 Moroni was that angel He saw our day as recorded in the Book of Mormon In repeated appearances he prepared Joseph Smith for his ministry including the translation of the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ Other prophets foretold of our day Malachi spoke of Elijah turning the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers 11 Elijah has come and as a result today we have 168 temples dotting the earth Each temple serves worthy members making sacred covenants and receiving blessed ordinances on behalf of themselves and their deceased ancestors This sacred work described by Malachi is central to the Creator s plan for the eternal destiny of His children 12We live in that time prophesied we are the people charged with ushering in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ we are to gather God s children those who will hear and embrace the truths covenants and promises of the everlasting gospel President Nelson calls it the greatest challenge the greatest cause and the greatest work on the earth today 13 Of that miracle I bear my witness By assignment from President Russell M Nelson in February of this year I dedicated the Durban South Africa Temple It was a day I will remember all my life I was with members who have come to the gospel as Jeremiah prophesied long ago one of a city and two of a family 14 The doctrine of Jesus Christ unites all of us around the world as sons and daughters of God as brothers and sisters in the gospel Regardless of how we look or dress we are one people with a Father in Heaven whose plan from the beginning was and is for His family to be reunited by making and keeping sacred temple covenants To a small gathering of priesthood holders in a schoolhouse in Kirtland Ohio in 1834 the Prophet Joseph prophesied It is only a little handfull of Priesthood you see here tonight but this Church will fill North and South America it will fill the world 15In recent years I have traveled throughout the world to meet the members of the Church My Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve have had similar assignments Still who can keep up with the schedule of our dear prophet President Nelson whose travel in his first two years as President of the Church has taken him to meet with the Saints in 32 countries and U S territories16 to witness of the living Christ I remember when I received my mission call as a young man I wanted to serve in Germany like my father brother and brother in law Not waiting for anyone to get home I rushed to the mailbox and opened the call I read that I had been called to the Eastern States Mission headquartered in New York City I was disappointed so I went inside and opened my scriptures for comfort I began to read in the Doctrine and Covenants Behold and lo I have much people in this place in the regions round about and an effectual door shall be opened in the regions round about in this eastern land 17 That prophecy given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1833 was a revelation to me I knew then I had been called to the exact mission the Lord wanted me to serve in I taught the Restoration and its dramatic beginning when our Father in Heaven spoke to Joseph Smith and said This is My Beloved Son Hear Him 18Of great significance for the whole Church is the prophecy of Isaiah given more than 700 years before the birth of Jesus Christ And it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord s house shall be established in the top of the mountains and all nations shall flow unto it 19In my mind today I picture millions of our members and friends connected to these proceedings electronically by television internet or other means We are sitting down as if together in the top of the mountains 20 It was Brigham Young who spoke the prophetic words This is the right place 21 The Saints some of them my own pioneer ancestors worked to establish Zion in the Rocky Mountains through the will and pleasure of him who dictates the nations of the earth 22I stand today on the sacred ground that has drawn millions of visitors In 2002 Salt Lake City hosted the Winter Olympic Games The Tabernacle Choir sang at the opening ceremonies and the Church offered concerts and programs for guests and participants from many many nations I will always remember seeing the temple in the background of the nightly news broadcasts worldwide Over the years presidents of the United States kings judges prime ministers ambassadors and officials from many lands have come to Salt Lake City and met with our leaders President Nelson hosted leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People a United States organization committed to equal rights without discrimination based on race I remember standing shoulder to shoulder with these friends and leaders as President Nelson joined them in calling for greater civility and racial harmony in the world 23Many more have come to Temple Square and met in council with Church leaders For example this past year to name just a few we welcomed the United Nations 68th Civil Society Conference a global gathering and the first of its kind outside of New York City We have met with Vietnam s Committee for Religious Affairs and ambassadors from Cuba the Philippines Argentina Romania Sudan Qatar and Saudi Arabia We also welcomed the secretary general of the Muslim World League What I am describing is a fulfillment of Isaiah s prophecy that in the last days nations shall flow unto the mountain of the Lord s house 24 The great Salt Lake Temple stands in the center of that majesty and glory It is not the landscape that has drawn people though our setting is magnificent it is the essence of pure religion exhibited in the spirit growth goodness and generosity of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and its people our love as God loves our commitment to a higher cause what Joseph Smith called the cause of Christ 25We do not know when the Savior will return but this we do know We must be prepared in heart and mind worthy to receive Him and honored to be part of all that was prophesied so long ago I testify that President Russell M Nelson is the Lord s prophet on the earth and at his side are Apostles called of God sustained as prophets seers and revelators And my dear brothers and sisters the Restoration continues I close with the prophecy of Joseph Smith words that I testify are true No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing persecutions may rage mobs may combine armies may assemble calumny may defame but the truth of God will go forth boldly nobly and independent till it has penetrated every continent visited every clime swept every country and sounded in every ear till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done 26 I so testify that these prophecies of Joseph Smith are being fulfilled I promise as you follow the inspired counsel of our dear prophet President Russell M Nelson his counselors the Apostles and other Church leaders and as you pay heed to the ancient prophets who foretold of our day you will be filled deep in your heart and soul with the spirit and the work of the Restoration I promise you will see the hand of God in your lives hear His promptings and feel His love In the name of Jesus Christ with gratitude for the Restoration of His gospel and His Church in evidence of His matchless love amen 
Dear brothers and sisters as we close this session may we each hold in our hearts the witness borne today of the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ We are blessed to have this sacred time together to reinforce our promise to the Lord Jesus Christ that we are His servants and He is our Savior The importance of making and keeping promises and covenants weighs heavy on my mind How important is it to you to keep your word to be trusted to do what you say you will do to strive to honor your sacred covenants to have integrity By living true to our promises to the Lord and to others we walk the covenant path back to our Father in Heaven and we feel His love in our lives Our Savior Jesus Christ is our great Exemplar when it comes to making and keeping promises and covenants He came to earth promising to do the will of the Father He taught gospel principles in word and in deed He atoned for our sins that we might live again He has honored every one of His promises Can the same be said of each of us What are the dangers if we cheat a little slip a little or do not quite follow through with our commitments What if we walk away from our covenants Will others come unto Christ in light of our example Is your word your bond Keeping promises is not a habit it is a characteristic of being a disciple of Jesus Christ Ever mindful of our frailties in mortal life the Lord promised Be of good cheer and do not fear for I the Lord am with you and will stand by you 1 I have felt His presence when needing reassurance comfort or greater spiritual insight or strength and I have been deeply humbled and am grateful for His divine companionship The Lord has said Every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me and calleth on my name and obeyeth my voice and keepeth my commandments shall see my face and know that I am 2 That is perhaps His ultimate promise I learned the importance of keeping my word in my youth One such example is when I stood at attention to recite the Scout Oath Our association with the Boy Scouts of America as it now concludes will always be an important legacy to me and this Church To the Scouting organization to the scores of men and women who have served diligently as Scout leaders to the moms real credit goes there and to the young men who have participated in Scouting we say Thank you In this very session our dear prophet President Russell M Nelson and Elder Quentin L Cook have announced adjustments that will refocus our attention on youth and align our organizations with revealed truth In addition just last Sunday President Nelson and President M Russell Ballard explained the new Children and Youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints program for the entire Church It is a worldwide initiative focused on our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are unified in this new direction and I personally bear my witness that the Lord has guided us every step of the way I am excited for the children and youth of the Church to experience this integrated focus on them both at home and at church through gospel learning service and activities and personal development The youth theme for this coming year 2020 speaks of Nephi s classic promise to go and do He wrote And it came to pass that I Nephi said unto my father I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them 3 Although it was uttered long ago we in the Church stand on that promise today To go and do means rising above the ways of the world receiving and acting on personal revelation living righteously with hope and faith in the future making and keeping covenants to follow Jesus Christ and thereby increasing our love for Him the Savior of the world A covenant is a two way promise between us and the Lord As members of the Church we covenant at baptism to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ to live as He lived Like those baptized at the Waters of Mormon we covenant to become His people to bear one another s burdens that they may be light to mourn with those that mourn comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places 4 Our ministering one to another in the Church reflects our commitment to honor those very promises When we partake of the sacrament we renew that covenant to take upon us His name and make additional promises to improve Our daily thoughts and actions both large and small reflect our commitment to Him His sacred promise in return is If ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you 5My question today is do we stand by our promises and covenants or are they sometimes half hearted commitments casually made and hence easily broken When we say to someone I will pray for you do we When we commit I will be there to help will we When we obligate ourselves to pay a debt do we When we raise our hands to sustain a fellow member in a new calling which means to give support do we One evening in my youth my mother sat with me at the foot of her bed and spoke fervently of the importance of living the Word of Wisdom I know from the experiences of others from years ago she said the loss of spirituality and sensitivity that comes from not following the Word of Wisdom She looked right into my eyes and I felt her words penetrate my heart Promise me Ronnie today she called me Ronnie that you will always live the Word of Wisdom I solemnly made that promise to her and I have held to it all these years That commitment served me well when I was in my youth and in later years when I was in business circles where substances flowed freely I made a decision in advance to follow God s laws and I never had to revisit it The Lord has said I the Lord am bound when ye do what I say but when ye do not what I say ye have no promise 6 What is He saying to those who abide by the Word of Wisdom That we will have the promise of health strength wisdom knowledge and angels to protect us 7Some years ago Sister Rasband and I were at the Salt Lake Temple for the sealing of one of our daughters As we stood outside the temple with a younger daughter not yet old enough to attend the ceremony we spoke of the importance of being sealed in the holy temple of God As my mother had taught me years before we said to our daughter We want you safely sealed in the temple and we want you to promise us that when you find your eternal companion you will make a date with him to be sealed in the temple She gave us her word She has since stated that our talk and her promise protected her and reminded her what was most important She later made sacred covenants as she was sealed to her husband in the temple President Nelson has taught We increase the Savior s power in our lives when we make sacred covenants and keep those covenants with precision Our covenants bind us to Him and give us godly power 8When we keep promises to one another we are more likely to keep promises to the Lord Remember the Lord s words Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me 9Reflect with me on examples of promises in the scriptures Ammon and the sons of Mosiah in the Book of Mormon committed to preach the word of God 10 When Ammon was captured by Lamanite forces he was taken before the Lamanite King Lamoni He committed to the king I will be thy servant 11 When raiders came to steal the king s sheep Ammon cut off their arms So astonished was the king he listened to Ammon s message of the gospel and was converted Ruth in the Old Testament promised her mother in law Whither thou goest I will go 12 She lived true to her word The good Samaritan in a parable in the New Testament promised the innkeeper if he would care for the injured traveler Whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee 13 Zoram in the Book of Mormon promised to go into the wilderness with Nephi and his brothers Nephi recounted When Zoram had made an oath unto us our fears did cease concerning him 14What of the ancient promise made to the fathers as described in the scriptures that the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers 15 In the pre earth life when we chose God s plan we made a promise to help gather Israel on both sides of the veil We went into a partnership with the Lord Elder John A Widtsoe explained years ago The working out of the plan became then not merely the Father s work and the Savior s work but also our work 16 The gathering is the most important thing taking place on earth today President Nelson has said as he has traveled the world When we speak of the gathering we are simply saying this fundamental truth every one of our Heavenly Father s children on both sides of the veil deserves to hear the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ 17As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I conclude with an invitation and promise First the invitation I invite you to consider the promises and covenants you make with the Lord and with others with great integrity knowing that your word is your bond Second I promise you as you do this the Lord will establish your words and sanction your deeds as you strive with unwearied diligence to build up your lives your families and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints He will be with you my dear brothers and sisters and you can with confidence look forward to being received into heaven that thereby you may dwell with God in a state of never ending happiness for the Lord God hath spoken it 18Of this I testify and promise in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters as this conference comes to a close I give thanks to our Father in Heaven for the counsel truths and revelation shared at this pulpit during the past two days We have been taught by servants of God called to speak His holy words The Lord has reminded us in latter day revelation Whether by mine own voice or the voice of my servants it is the same 1Looking over this vast congregation of Saints and picturing members watching general conference all over the world I think of the gathering in the Book of Mormon when Jesus Christ appeared to the Nephites following His Crucifixion He taught them the gospel and then encouraged Go ye unto your homes and ponder upon the things which I have said and ask of the Father in my name that ye may understand 2 Go ye unto your homes and ponder is the next step in taking to heart the words of prophets and Church leaders spoken in this sacred setting Christ centered homes are fortresses for the kingdom of God on earth in a day when as prophesied the devil rage s in the hearts of the children of men and stir s them up to anger against that which is good 3People have built fortresses throughout history to keep the enemy outside Often those fortresses included a guard tower where watchmen like prophets warned of menacing forces and coming attacks In early Utah pioneer times my great grandfather Thomas Rasband and his family were some of the first settlers to enter the Heber Valley in the beautiful Wasatch Mountains of Utah In 1859 Thomas helped construct the Heber fort built for their protection It was a simple structure of cottonwood logs positioned one next to the other forming the perimeter of the fort Log cabins were built inside the fortress using that common wall The structure provided both security and safety for those pioneer families as they put down roots and worshipped the Lord Fort Heber like Fort Clatsop pictured here was a place of refuge for early pioneers So it is with us Our homes are fortresses against the evils of the world In our homes we come unto Christ by learning to follow His commandments by studying the scriptures and praying together and by helping one another stay on the covenant path The new emphasis on personal and family study in the home through the curriculum Come Follow Me is designed to deepen our conversion and help us become more like Jesus Christ 4 In so doing we will become what Paul called new creature s 5 with our hearts and souls in tune with God We need that strength to face and deflect the assaults of the adversary As we live with devotion born of faith in Jesus Christ we will feel the peaceful presence of the Holy Ghost who guides us to truth inspires us to live worthy of the Lord s blessings and bears witness that God lives and loves us All this within the fortress of our own homes But remember our homes are only as powerful as the spiritual strength of each one of us within the walls President Russell M Nelson has taught In coming days it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding directing comforting and constant influence of the Holy Ghost 6 As the Lord s living prophet seer and revelator in this day the watchman on the tower of our fortress The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints he sees the advances of the enemy Brothers and sisters we are at war with Satan for the souls of men The battle lines were drawn in our pre earth life Satan and a third of our Father in Heaven s children turned away from His promises of exaltation Since that time the adversary s minions have been fighting the faithful who choose the Father s plan Satan knows his days are numbered and that time is growing shorter As crafty and cunning as he is he will not win However his battle for each one of our souls rages on For our safety we must build a fortress of spirituality and protection for our very souls a fortress that will not be penetrated by the evil one Satan is a subtle snake sneaking into our minds and hearts when we have let our guard down faced a disappointment or lost hope He entices us with flattery a promise of ease comfort or a temporary high when we are low He justifies pride unkindness dishonesty discontent and immorality and in time we can be past feeling 7 The Spirit can leave us And thus the devil cheateth their souls and leadeth them away carefully down to hell 8In contrast we often feel the Spirit so powerfully as we sing praises to God with words like these A mighty fortress is our God A tower of strength ne er failing A helper mighty is our God O er ills of life prevailing 9When we build a fortress of spiritual strength we can shun the advances of the adversary turn our backs on him and feel the peace of the Spirit We can follow the example of our Lord and Savior who when tempted in the wilderness said Get thee behind me Satan 10 We each have to learn by the experiences of life how to do that Such righteous purpose is well described in the Book of Mormon when Captain Moroni prepared the Nephites to face attacks from a deceitful bloodthirsty power hungry Amalickiah Moroni constructed fortresses to protect the Nephites that they might live unto the Lord their God and that they might maintain that which was called by their enemies the cause of Christians 11 Moroni was firm in the faith of Christ 12 and was faithful in keeping the commandments of God and resisting iniquity 13When the Lamanites came to battle they were astonished by the Nephites preparation and they were defeated The Nephites thanked the Lord their God because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies 14 They had built fortresses for protection on the outside and they had built faith in the Lord Jesus Christ on the inside deep in their souls What are some ways we can fortify ourselves in troubled times that we may be instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work 15 Let s look to the scriptures We are obedient The Lord commanded Father Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem to seek the records and bring them down hither into the wilderness 16 Lehi didn t question he didn t wonder why or how Nor did Nephi who responded I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded 17Do we act with the willing obedience of Nephi Or are we more inclined to question God s commands as did Nephi s brothers whose lack of faith eventually turned them away from the Lord Obedience exercised with holiness of heart 18 is what the Lord asks of us We trust the Lord who said to Joshua as he prepared to lead the Israelites into the promised land Be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest 19 Joshua trusted those words and counseled the people Sanctify yourselves for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you 20 The Lord parted the waters of the Jordan and the Israelites 40 years of wandering in the wilderness ended We stand for the truth as did the prophet Abinadi in the Book of Mormon Arrested brought before King Noah and his wicked priests Abinadi taught the Ten Commandments and preached powerfully that Christ would come down among the children of men and redeem his people 21 He then with faith deep within him proclaimed O God receive my soul 22 and Abinadi suffered death by fire 23We make and renew our covenants by partaking of the sacrament and by worshipping in the temple The sacrament is the centerpiece of our Sunday worship where we are receiving the promise to always have his Spirit to be with us 24 With that sacred ordinance we commit to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ to follow Him and to shoulder our responsibilities in this divine work as He did In the temple we can lay aside the things of this world 25 and feel the Lord s presence and His transcendent peace We can focus on our ancestors our families and eternal life in the presence of the Father No wonder President Nelson stated recently in Rome The good that will emanate from this temple is incalculably great 26We should have integrity in all that we do We should develop discernment and discipline so that we do not have to continually determine what is right and what is wrong We should take to heart the words of Peter the early Church Apostle who cautioned Be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 27As we diligently strengthen our fortifications we become like Jesus Christ as His true disciples with our very souls in His protection Your testimony of Jesus Christ is your personal fortress the security for your soul When my great grandfather and his fellow pioneers built the Heber fort they put up one log at a time until the fort was fitly framed together 28 and they were protected So it is with testimony One by one we gain a witness from the Holy Spirit as He speaks to our own spirit teaching truth in the inward parts 29 When we live the gospel of Jesus Christ when we draw upon the Savior s Atonement and press forward with faith not fear we are fortified against the wiles of the adversary Our testimonies connect us to the heavens and we are blessed with the truth of all things 30 And like pioneers protected by a fortress we are safely encircled in the arms of the Savior s love The prophet Ether taught Wherefore whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world yea even a place at the right hand of God which hope cometh of faith maketh an anchor to the souls of men which would make them sure and steadfast always abounding in good works being led to glorify God 31My dear brothers and sisters I leave you with my blessing to go forth with confidence in the Lord and in His gospel Put your arms around those who stumble and with the strength of the Spirit within you lead them lovingly back to the fortress of spirituality and protection Seek to be like Jesus 32 in all that you do shun evil and temptations repent as we were admonished yesterday by our dear prophet be honest in heart be upright and pure show compassion and charity and love the Lord your God with the devotion of a true disciple Our testimonies of the gospel of Jesus Christ our homes our families and our membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints will be our personal fortresses of protection surrounding us and shielding us from the power of the evil one Of this I bear my solemn witness in the name of our Lord and Savior even Jesus Christ amen 
I add my witness to the messages of President Russell M Nelson and Elder Quentin L Cook given moments ago of the harmony and unanimity of the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles I know these revelatory announcements are the mind and the will of the Lord and will bless and strengthen individuals families and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints for generations to come Some years ago one of our young married daughters and her husband asked Sister Rasband and me a very important life influencing question Is it still safe and wise to bring children into this seemingly wicked and frightening world we live in Now that was an important question for a mom and dad to consider with their dear married children We could hear the fear in their voices and feel the fear in their hearts Our answer to them was a firm Yes it s more than OK as we shared fundamental gospel teachings and our own heartfelt impressions and life experiences Fear is not new The disciples of Jesus Christ out on the Sea of Galilee feared the wind and the waves in the dark of the night 1 As His disciples today we too have fears Our single adults fear making commitments such as getting married Young marrieds like our children can fear bringing children into an increasingly wicked world Missionaries fear lots of things especially approaching strangers Widows fear going forward alone Teenagers fear not being accepted grade schoolers fear the first day of school university students fear getting back a test We fear failure rejection disappointment and the unknown We fear hurricanes earthquakes and fires that ravage the land and our lives We fear not being chosen and on the flip side we fear being chosen We fear not being good enough we fear that the Lord has no blessings for us We fear change and our fears can escalate to terror Have I included just about everyone Since ancient times fear has limited the perspective of God s children I have always loved the account of Elisha in 2 Kings The king of Syria had sent a legion that came by night and compassed the city about 2 Their intent was to capture and kill the prophet Elisha We read And when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots And his servant said unto him Alas my master how shall we do 3That was fear speaking And Elisha answered Fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them 4But he didn t stop there Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha 5We may or may not have chariots of fire sent to dispel our fears and conquer our demons but the lesson is clear The Lord is with us mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice The Lord knew that at times we would feel fear I have been there and so have you which is why the scriptures are replete with the Lord s counsel Be of good cheer and do not fear 6 Look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not 7 Fear not little flock 8 I love the tenderness of little flock In this Church we may be few in number by the way the world counts influence but when we open our spiritual eyes they that be with us are more than they that be with them 9 Our loving Shepherd Jesus Christ then continues Let earth and hell combine against you for if ye are built upon my rock they cannot prevail 10How is fear dispelled For the young lad he was standing right next to Elisha a prophet of God We have that same promise When we listen to President Russell M Nelson when we hearken to his counsel we are standing with a prophet of God Remember the words of Joseph Smith And now after the many testimonies which have been given of him this is the testimony last of all which we give of him That he lives 11 Jesus Christ lives Our love for Him and His gospel dispels fear Our desire to always have his Spirit 12 with us will push fear aside for a more eternal view of our mortal lives President Nelson has cautioned In coming days it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding directing comforting and constant influence of the Holy Ghost 13The Lord said regarding the scourges that would cover the land and would harden the hearts of many My disciples shall stand in holy places and shall not be moved 14And then this divine counsel Be not troubled for when all these things shall come to pass ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled 15Stand in holy places be not troubled and promises shall be fulfilled Let s look at each one of these in relation to our fears First stand in holy places When we stand in holy places our righteous homes our dedicated chapels the consecrated temples we feel the Spirit of the Lord with us We find answers to questions that trouble us or the peace to simply set them aside That is the Spirit in action These sacred places in the kingdom of God on earth call for our reverence our respect for others our best selves in living the gospel and our hopes to lay aside our fears and seek the healing power of Jesus Christ through His Atonement There is no room for fear in these holy places of God or in the hearts of His children Why Because of love God loves us always and we love Him Our love of God counters all fears and His love abounds in holy places Think about it When we are tentative in our commitments to the Lord when we stray from His path leading to life eternal when we question or doubt our significance in His divine design when we allow fear to open the door to all its companions discouragement anger frustration disappointment the Spirit leaves us and we are without the Lord If you know what that is like you know it is not a good place to be In contrast when we stand in holy places we can feel God s love and perfect love casteth out all fear 16The next promise is Be not troubled 17 No matter how much wickedness and chaos fill the earth we are promised by our daily faithfulness in Jesus Christ the peace of God which passeth all understanding 18 And when Christ comes in all power and glory evil rebellion and injustice will end Long ago the Apostle Paul prophesied of our times saying to the young Timothy This know also that in the last days perilous times shall come For men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God 19Remember they that be with us on both sides of the veil those who love the Lord with all their heart might mind and strength are more than they that be with them 20 If we actively trust in the Lord and His ways if we are engaged in His work we will not fear the trends of the world or be troubled by them I plead with you to set aside worldly influences and pressures and seek spirituality in your daily life Love what the Lord loves which includes His commandments His holy houses our sacred covenants with Him the sacrament each Sabbath day our communication through prayer and you will not be troubled The last point trust the Lord and His promises I know that all His promises will be fulfilled I know it as firmly as I stand here before you in this sacred meeting The Lord has revealed For they that are wise and have received the truth and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide and have not been deceived verily I say unto you they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire but shall abide the day 21This is why we should not be troubled by the turmoil of today by those in the great and spacious building by those who scoff at honest effort and dedicated service to the Lord Jesus Christ Optimism courage even charity come from a heart not burdened by troubles or turmoil President Nelson who is optimistic about the future has reminded us If we are to have any hope of sifting through the myriad of voices and the philosophies of men that attack truth we must learn to receive revelation 22To receive personal revelation we must place priority on living the gospel and encouraging faithfulness and spirituality in others as well as ourselves Spencer W Kimball was one of the prophets of my youth These past few years after being called as an Apostle I have found peace in his first message at general conference in October 1943 He was overwhelmed by his call I know what that feels like Elder Kimball said I did a great deal of thinking and praying and fasting and praying There were conflicting thoughts that surged through my mind seeming voices saying You can t do the work You are not worthy You have not the ability and always finally came the triumphant thought You must do the work assigned you must make yourself able worthy and qualified And the battle raged on 23I take heart from that purehearted testimony of this Apostle who would become the 12th President of this mighty Church He recognized he had to put behind him his fears to do the work assigned and that he had to rely on the Lord for the strength to make himself able worthy and qualified We can too The battles will rage on but we will face them with the Spirit of the Lord We will be not troubled because when we stand with the Lord and stand for His principles and His eternal plan we are standing on holy ground Now what about that daughter and son in law who asked the very heartfelt and probing fear based question years ago They seriously considered our conversation that night they prayed and fasted and came to their own conclusions Happily and joyfully for them and for us the grandparents they have now been blessed with seven beautiful children as they go forward in faith and love Take heart brothers and sisters Yes we live in perilous times but as we stay on the covenant path we need not fear I bless you that as you do so you will not be troubled by the times in which we live or the troubles that come your way I bless you to choose to stand in holy places and be not moved I bless you to believe in the promises of Jesus Christ that He lives and that He is watching over us caring for us and standing by us In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brethren of the priesthood it is with great humility that I stand before you on this historic occasion under assignment by our dear prophet and President Russell M Nelson How I love and sustain this wonderful man of God and our new First Presidency I add my witness to that of Elder D Todd Christofferson and my other Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that the changes announced this evening are the will of the Lord As stated by President Nelson this is a matter that has been prayerfully discussed and considered by the senior Brethren of the Church for a long time The desire was to seek the Lord s will and strengthen the quorums of the Melchizedek Priesthood Inspiration was received and this evening our prophet made known the will of the Lord Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets 1 How blessed we are to have a living prophet today Throughout our life Sister Rasband and I have traveled the world on various Church and professional assignments I have seen nearly every type of unit configuration in the Church a small branch in Russia where the number of Melchizedek Priesthood holders could be counted on one hand a new and growing ward in Africa where both high priests and elders met as a single body because the overall number of Melchizedek Priesthood holders was low and well established wards where the number of elders required the dividing of their quorum into two quorums Everywhere we have gone we have witnessed the hand of the Lord going before His servants preparing the people and the way ahead so that all His children might be blessed according to their every need Hasn t He promised that He will go before our face and be on our right hand and on our left and that His Spirit shall be in our hearts and His angels round about us 2Thinking about all of you I am reminded of the hymn Behold A Royal Army Behold A royal army With banner sword and shield Is marching forth to conquerOn life s great battlefield Its ranks are filled with soldiers United bold and strong Who follow their CommanderAnd sing their joyful song 3Elder Christofferson has answered several questions that are certain to arise from the announcement that high priests groups and elders quorums at the ward level are being combined into one unified mighty army of brethren of the Melchizedek Priesthood These adjustments will help elders quorums and Relief Societies harmonize their work They will also simplify the quorum s coordination with the bishopric and ward council And they allow the bishop to delegate more responsibilities to the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents so that the bishop and his counselors can focus on their primary duties particularly presiding over the young women and the young men who bear the Aaronic Priesthood Changes in organizations and functions of the Church are not uncommon In 1883 the Lord said to President John Taylor Concerning the management and organization of my Church and Priesthood I will reveal unto you from time to time through the channels that I have appointed everything that shall be necessary for the future development and perfection of my Church for the adjustment and rolling forth of my kingdom 4Now a few words to you brethren who are high priests know that we love you Our Father in Heaven loves you You are a great part of the royal army of the priesthood and we cannot move this work forward without your goodness service experience and righteousness Alma taught that men are called to be high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works to teach and to minister to others 5 That experience is needed now perhaps more than ever In many wards we may have high priests who are now going to have the opportunity to be presided over by an elder as their quorum president We have a precedent of elders presiding over high priests elders are currently serving as branch presidents in some regions of the world where high priests reside in the branch and there are branches in which only an elders quorum is organized and high priests are present What a joy it will be for all Melchizedek Priesthood holders to have the blessing of teaching learning and serving shoulder to shoulder with all the members in their ward Wherever you are and whatever your circumstances may be we invite you prayerfully faithfully and joyfully to accept new opportunities to lead or to be led and to serve unitedly as a body of priesthood brethren I will now address additional matters which may need clarification as we move forward to implement the will of the Lord regarding the organization of His quorums of the holy priesthood What are the adjustments for a stake high priests quorum Stake high priests quorums will continue to function Stake presidencies will continue to serve as the presidency of the stake high priests quorum However as noted by Elder Christofferson members of the stake high priests quorum will now consist of high priests currently serving in the stake presidency as members of a ward bishopric as members of the stake high council and the functioning patriarch Ward and stake clerks and executive secretaries are not members of the stake high priests quorum When someone who is actively serving as a high priest patriarch Seventy or Apostle is visiting a ward and desires to attend priesthood meeting he will meet with the elders quorum As brethren in these callings are released in due course they will return to their home units as members of the elders quorum What is the role of the stake high priests quorum The stake presidency meets with members of the high priests quorum to counsel together to testify and to provide training Stake meetings as outlined in our handbooks will continue with two adjustments One wards and stakes will no longer hold priesthood executive committee meetings If a special ward issue arises such as a delicate family matter or an unusual welfare challenge it could be addressed in an expanded bishopric meeting Other less sensitive matters can be addressed in the ward council What has been known as the stake priesthood executive committee meeting will now be called the high council meeting Two the annual meeting of all ordained high priests in the stake will no longer be held However the stake presidency will continue to hold an annual meeting of the stake high priests quorum as has been announced today Can a ward have more than one elders quorum The answer is yes In the spirit of Doctrine and Covenants section 107 verse 89 when a ward has an unusually large number of active Melchizedek Priesthood bearers leaders may organize more than one elders quorum In such cases each quorum should have a reasonable balance in terms of age experience and priesthood office and strength I testify that as we move forward with this inspired quorum restructuring in our wards and stakes we will see a multitude of blessings Let me cite just a few examples Under the direction of the bishop more priesthood resources may assist with the work of salvation This would include the gathering of Israel through temple and family history work working with families and individuals in need and helping the missionaries to bring souls to Jesus Christ As previous presiding leaders return to share their experience with the quorum of elders a stronger quorum membership will result There will be a greater diversity of gifts and capacities within the quorum There will be more flexibility and availability to meet current and urgent needs within the ward and quorum and in fulfilling our various ministering assignments There will be an increase in mentoring and unity as a new elder and an experienced high priest share experiences side by side in quorum meetings and assignments Bishops and branch presidents will hopefully be liberated to magnify their callings to shepherd their flocks and to minister to those in need We understand that each ward and stake is different While understanding these differences we are hopeful that you will follow through with these changes promptly following this general conference We have been given direction by a prophet of God What a tremendous blessing and responsibility Let us fulfill it with all righteousness and diligence I remind you priesthood authority comes by way of setting apart and ordination but real priesthood power the power to act in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can come only through righteous living The Lord declared to the Prophet Joseph Smith the prophet of the Restoration Behold and lo I will take care of your flocks and will raise up elders and send unto them Behold I will hasten my work in its time 6Indeed this is a time when the Lord is hastening His work Let us each use this opportunity to reflect and improve our lives to better align with His will so that we may deserve the many blessings He has promised to the true and faithful Brethren thank you for all that you are doing to be a part of this magnificent work May we go forward in this great and honored cause Oh when the war is ended When strife and conflicts cease When all are safely gatheredWithin the vale of peace Before the King eternal That vast and mighty throngShall praise his name forever And this shall be their song Victory victory Thru him that redeemed us Victory victory Thru Jesus Christ our Lord Victory victory victory Thru Jesus Christ our Lord 7Today we all stand as witnesses of the Lord revealing His will through His prophet President Russell M Nelson I testify that he is God s prophet here on earth I bear my witness of the Lord Jesus Christ who is our great Redeemer and Savior This is His work and this is His will to which I bear solemn testimony in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters as I stand here in this inspiring worldwide general conference and feel your strength and your spirits I cannot help but think of the words of the Apostle Peter Lord it is good for us to be here 1That is not exactly what Alma said after preaching to the people in Ammonihah Alma left the city due to the wickedness of the people Soon an angel appeared to Alma and called him to return to the city of Ammonihah and preach again unto the people of the city 2Alma did so speedily entering the city by another way 3 As he entered the city he was an hungered and he said to a man Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat And the man said unto him I am a Nephite and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision Thou shalt receive 4The man was Amulek Now did Alma just happen upon Amulek No it was no coincidence that he went into the city by the way that would lead him to this faithful man who would become his missionary companion Elder Neal A Maxwell once explained None of us ever fully utilizes the people opportunities allocated to us within our circles of friendship You and I may call these intersectings coincidence This word is understandable for mortals to use but coincidence is not an appropriate word to describe the workings of an omniscient God He does not do things by coincidence but by divine design 5Our lives are like a chessboard and the Lord moves us from one place to another if we are responsive to spiritual promptings Looking back we can see His hand in our lives We can see such heavenly intervention when Nephi returns to get the plates from Laban He was led by the Spirit not knowing beforehand the things that he should do 6 Laban was soon before him in a drunken stupor and Nephi slew him retrieved the plates and fled back to his brothers Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban Or was it by divine design Significant events unfold in the gospel and in the Church that further the kingdom of God on earth They are not by accident but by God s plan He who fashioned this world can calm the seas with His word and can steer both Alma and Amulek and Nephi and Laban to be at the right place at precisely the right time Likewise events and associations unfold in each of our lives that further God s work on earth Dear Elder Joseph B Wirthlin spoke of an occasion when President Thomas S Monson said to him There is a guiding hand above all things Often when things happen it s not by accident One day when we look back at the seeming coincidences of our lives we will realize that perhaps they weren t so coincidental after all 7Most often our good works are known to only a few They are however recorded in heaven One day we will stand as a witness of our whole souled devotion to works of righteousness No trial or calamity can derail God s plan of happiness Indeed by divine design joy cometh in the morning 8 I came into the world to do the will of the Father 9 Jesus taught Dear brothers and sisters so have we Through the experience of my own life s journey I know that the Lord will move us on that seeming chessboard to do His work What may appear to be a random chance is in fact overseen by a loving Father in Heaven who can number the hairs of every head 10 Not even a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father s notice 11 The Lord is in the small details of our lives and those incidents and opportunities are to prepare us to lift our families and others as we build the kingdom of God on earth Remember as the Lord said to Abraham I know the end from the beginning therefore my hand shall be over thee 12The Lord placed me in a home with loving parents By the world s standards they were very ordinary people my father a devoted man was a truck driver my angel mother a stay at home mom The Lord helped me find my lovely wife Melanie He prompted a businessman who became a dear friend to give me an employment opportunity The Lord called me to serve in the mission field both as a young man and as a mission president He called me to the Quorum of the Seventy and now He has called me as an Apostle Looking back I realize I did not orchestrate any of those moves the Lord did just as He is orchestrating important moves for you and for those you love What should you be looking for in your own life What are God s miracles that remind you that He is close saying I am right here Think of those times some daily when the Lord has acted in your life and then acted again Treasure them as moments the Lord has shown confidence in you and in your choices But allow Him to make more of you than you can make of yourself on your own Treasure His involvement Sometimes we consider changes in our plans as missteps on our journey Think of them more as first steps to being on the Lord s errand 13Some months ago our granddaughter joined a youth group to tour several Church history sites The final itinerary noted that she would be passing through the very area where her missionary brother our grandson was serving Our granddaughter had no intention of seeing her brother on his mission However as the bus entered the town where her brother was serving two missionaries could be seen walking down the street One of the missionaries was her brother Anticipation filled the bus as the youth asked the bus driver to pull over so she could greet her brother In less than one minute after tears and sweet words her brother was back on his way to fulfill his missionary duties We later learned that her brother had been on that street for less than five minutes walking from an appointment to his car Heavenly Father can put us in situations with specific intent in mind He has done so in my life and He is doing so in yours as He did in the lives of our dear grandchildren Each of us is precious and loved by the Lord who cares who whispers and who watches over us in ways unique to each of us He is infinitely wiser and more powerful than mortal men and women He knows our challenges our triumphs and the righteous desires of our hearts Over a year ago as I was walking through Temple Square one of the sister missionaries approached me and asked Do you remember me I am from Florida She told me her name Sister Aida Chilan Yes I remembered meeting her and her family Her stake president had suggested we visit her family It became apparent that we were there for their daughter Aida who had not been baptized After our visit and more than a year of teaching and fellowshipping Aida was baptized After we visited on Temple Square she wrote me a letter She said I know with all my heart that Heavenly Father knows each of us and that He continues to place us in each other s paths for a reason Thank you for being one of my missionaries for reaching out to me and finding me five years ago 14 Aida also sent me her conversion story recounting the divine coincidences which have taken place in her life that have led to her baptism and confirmation serving a mission on Temple Square and her recent temple marriage 15Was it a mere coincidence that the stake president had steered us to the Chilan home or that she and I would later meet on Temple Square Aida s testimony bears record that this was all part of God s divine design The Lord loves to be with us It is no coincidence that when you are feeling His Spirit and acting on first promptings that you feel Him as He promised I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 16We all have similar things happen in our lives We may meet someone who seems familiar renew an acquaintance or find common ground with a stranger When those occur perhaps the Lord is reminding us that we are all truly brothers and sisters We are really engaged in the same cause in what Joseph Smith called the cause of Christ 17Now where does our agency fit in a divine design We have a choice to follow or to not follow our Savior and His chosen leaders The pattern is clear in the Book of Mormon when the Nephites had turned away from the Lord Mormon lamented And they saw that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them yea it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness 18Not all that the Lord asks of us is a result of how strong we are how faithful we are or what we may know Think of Saul whom the Lord stopped on the road to Damascus He was going the wrong direction in his life and it had nothing to do with north or south Saul was divinely redirected When he was known later as Paul his apostolic ministry reflected what the Lord already knew he was capable of doing and becoming not what he had set out to do as Saul In the same manner the Lord knows what each of us is capable of doing and becoming What did the Apostle Paul teach And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose 19When we are righteous willing and able when we are striving to be worthy and qualified we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father s divine design Each of us has divinity within us When we see God working through us and with us may we be encouraged even grateful for that guidance When our Father in Heaven said This is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 20 He was talking about all of His children you in particular The Lord s hand is guiding you By divine design He is in the small details of your life as well as the major milestones As it says in Proverbs Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and he shall direct thy paths 21 I testify that He will bless you sustain you and bring you peace In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters I like all of you recognize we are seeing the hastening of the Lord s work through President Thomas S Monson and his message this morning President Monson we love you sustain you and ever pray for you our prophet dear 1We have felt an outpouring of the Spirit this weekend Whether you are here in this great hall or watching from homes or gathered in meetinghouses in distant parts of the world you have had the opportunity to feel the Spirit of the Lord That Spirit confirms to your hearts and minds the truths taught at this conference Consider the words of this familiar hymn Let the Holy Spirit guide Let him teach us what is true He will testify of Christ Light our minds with heaven s view 2From latter day revelation we know that the Godhead is comprised of three distinct and separate beings our Father in Heaven His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost We know that the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man s the Son also but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones but is a personage of Spirit Were it not so the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us 3My message today focuses on the importance of the Holy Ghost in our lives Our Father in Heaven knew that in mortality we would face challenges tribulation and turmoil He knew we would wrestle with questions disappointments temptations and weaknesses To give us mortal strength and divine guidance He provided the Holy Spirit another name for the Holy Ghost The Holy Ghost binds us to the Lord By divine assignment He inspires testifies teaches and prompts us to walk in the light of the Lord We have the sacred responsibility to learn to recognize His influence in our lives and respond Remember the Lord s promise I will impart unto you of my Spirit which shall enlighten your mind which shall fill your soul with joy 4 I love that assurance Joy that fills our souls brings with it an eternal perspective in contrast to day to day living That joy comes as peace amidst hardship or heartache It provides comfort and courage unfolds the truths of the gospel and expands our love for the Lord and all God s children Although the need for such blessings is so great in many ways the world has forgotten and forsaken them Each week as we partake of the holy sacrament we make a covenant to always remember him the Lord Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice When we keep this sacred covenant the promise is given that we may always have his Spirit to be with us 5How do we do that First we strive to live worthy of the Spirit The Holy Ghost accompanies those who are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day 6 As the Lord counseled we must lay aside the things of this world and seek for the things of a better 7 for the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples 8 We must always try to obey God s laws study the scriptures pray attend the temple and live true to the thirteenth article of faith being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and doing good to all men Second we must be willing to receive the Spirit The Lord has promised I will tell you in your mind and in your heart by the Holy Ghost which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart 9 I began to understand this as a young missionary in Scotch Plains New Jersey One hot July morning my companion and I felt prompted to look up a Temple Square referral We knocked on the door of the Elwood Schaffer home Mrs Schaffer politely turned us away As she began to shut the door I felt to do something I had never done before and have never done since I stuck my foot in the door and I asked Is there anyone else who might be interested in our message Her 16 year old daughter Marti did have an interest and had fervently prayed for guidance just the day before Marti met with us and in time her mother participated in the discussions Both of them joined the Church Resulting from Marti s baptism 136 people including many of her own family have been baptized and made gospel covenants How grateful I am that I listened to the Spirit and stuck my foot in the door on that hot July day Marti and a number of her dear family members are here today Third we must recognize the Spirit when it comes My experience has been that the Spirit most often communicates as a feeling You feel it in words that are familiar to you that make sense to you that prompt you Consider the response of the Nephites as they listened to the Lord pray for them And the multitude did hear and do bear record and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed 10 They felt in their hearts the words of His prayer The voice of the Holy Spirit is still and small In the Old Testament Elijah contended with the priests of Baal The priests expected the voice of Baal to come down as thunder and light their sacrifice with fire But there was no voice and there was no fire 11On a later occasion Elijah prayed And behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake And after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice 12Do you know that voice President Monson has taught As we pursue the journey of life let us learn the language of the Spirit 13 The Spirit speaks words that we feel These feelings are gentle a nudge to act to do something to say something to respond in a certain way If we are casual or complacent in our worship drawn off and desensitized by worldly pursuits we find ourselves diminished in our ability to feel Nephi said to Laman and Lemuel Ye have heard his voice from time to time and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice but ye were past feeling that ye could not feel the words 14Last June I was on an assignment to South America We were on a tight 10 day schedule visiting Colombia Peru and Ecuador An enormous earthquake had killed hundreds injured tens of thousands damaged and destroyed homes and communities in the Ecuadorian cities of Portoviejo and Manta I felt prompted to add to our schedule a visit to members living in those cities With damage to the roads we weren t sure we could get there In fact we had been told we could not get there but the prompting would not go away Consequently we were blessed and were able to visit both cities With such short notice I expected that only a few local priesthood leaders would attend the hastily organized gatherings However we arrived at each stake center to find the chapels filled all the way back to the stage Some who attended were the stalwarts of the region the pioneers who had held fast to the Church encouraging others to join them in worship and to feel the Spirit in their lives Sitting on the front rows were the members who had lost loved ones and neighbors in the earthquake I felt prompted to bestow an apostolic blessing upon all who were in attendance one of my very first given Though I was standing at the front of that room it was as if my hands were on each of their heads and I felt the words of the Lord pouring forth It didn t end there I felt prompted to speak to them just as Jesus Christ had done when visiting the people in the Americas He took their little children and blessed them and prayed unto the Father for them 15 We were in Ecuador we were about our Father s business and these were His children Fourth we must act on the first prompting Remember the words of Nephi I was led by the Spirit not knowing beforehand the things which I should do Nevertheless he said I went forth 16And so must we We must be confident in our first promptings Sometimes we rationalize we wonder if we are feeling a spiritual impression or if it is just our own thoughts When we begin to second guess even third guess our feelings and we all have we are dismissing the Spirit we are questioning divine counsel The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that if you will listen to the first promptings you will get it right nine times out of ten 17Now a caution don t expect fireworks because you responded to the Holy Ghost Remember you are about the work of the still small voice While serving as a mission president in New York City I was with some of our missionaries in a restaurant in the Bronx A young family came in and sat near us They appeared golden for the gospel I watched our missionaries as they continued to visit with me then noticed as the family concluded their meal and slipped out the door Then I said Elders there s a lesson here today You saw a lovely family come into this restaurant What should we have done One of the elders spoke up quickly I thought about getting up and going over to talk to them I felt the nudge but I didn t respond Elders I said we must always act on our first prompting That nudge you felt was the Holy Ghost First promptings are pure inspiration from heaven When they confirm or testify to us we need to recognize them for what they are and never let them slip past So often it is the Spirit inspiring us to reach out to someone in need family and friends in particular Thus the still small voice which whispereth through and pierceth all things 18 points us to opportunities to teach the gospel to bear testimony of the Restoration and Jesus Christ to offer support and concern and to rescue one of God s precious children Think of it as being what is called a first responder In most communities the first responders to a tragedy disaster or calamity are firefighters police officers paramedics They arrive with lights flashing and may I add we are so incredibly grateful for them The Lord s way is less obvious but requires just as immediate a response The Lord knows the needs of all His children and He knows who is prepared to help If we let the Lord know in our morning prayers that we are ready He will call on us to respond If we respond He will call on us time and time again and we will find ourselves on what President Monson calls the Lord s errand 19 We will become spiritual first responders bringing help from on high If we pay attention to the promptings that come to us we will grow in the spirit of revelation and receive more and more Spirit driven insight and direction The Lord has said Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good 20May we take seriously the Lord s call to be of good cheer for I will lead you along 21 He leads us by the Holy Ghost May we live close to the Spirit acting quickly upon our first promptings knowing they come from God I bear witness of the power of the Holy Ghost to guide us guard us and ever be with us in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Good afternoon dear brothers and sisters How blessed we have been during this conference My first year as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has been most humbling It has been a year of stretching growth and earnest ever present petitions to my Father in Heaven I have felt the sustaining prayers of family friends and Church members all around the globe Thank you for your thoughts and prayers I have also had the privilege of meeting with cherished friends some from years past and many I have met recently It was after a meeting with a dear friend that I have known and loved for many years that I felt impressed to prepare my remarks today When we met my friend confided that he had been struggling He felt he was experiencing to use his words a crisis of faith and sought my counsel I felt grateful that he would share his feelings and concerns with me He expressed a great longing for what he had once felt spiritually and what he now thought he was losing As he spoke I listened carefully and prayed earnestly to know what the Lord would have me say My friend like perhaps some of you asked the question so poignantly phrased in the Primary song Heavenly Father are you really there 1 For those of you who may be asking this same question I would like to share with you the counsel I would offer to my friend and hope that each of you may find your faith strengthened and your resolve renewed to be a committed disciple of Jesus Christ I begin by reminding you that you are a son or daughter of a loving Father in Heaven and that His love remains constant I know that such reassuring feelings of love are difficult to recall when you are in the midst of personal struggles or trials disappointments or broken dreams Jesus Christ knows about fierce struggles and trials He gave His life for us His final hours were brutal beyond anything we can even comprehend but His sacrifice for each one of us was the ultimate expression of His pure love No mistake sin or choice will change God s love for us That does not mean sinful conduct is condoned nor does it remove our obligation to repent when sins are committed But do not forget Heavenly Father knows and loves each of you and He is always ready to help As I pondered my friend s situation my mind reflected on the great wisdom found in the Book of Mormon And now my sons remember remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer who is Christ the Son of God that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds yea his shafts in the whirlwind yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo because of the rock upon which ye are built which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall 2I testify that the gulf of misery and endless wo is a place no one wants to be And my friend was feeling that he was on the edge When I have counseled individuals such as my friend I have explored their decisions made over the years which led them to forget sacred experiences to weaken and to doubt I encouraged them as I encourage you now to recall especially in times of crisis when you felt the Spirit and your testimony was strong remember the spiritual foundations you have built I promise that if you will do this avoiding things that do not build and strengthen your testimony or that mock your beliefs those precious times when your testimony prospered will return again to your memory through humble prayer and fasting I assure you that you will once again feel the safety and warmth of the gospel of Jesus Christ Each of us must first strengthen ourselves spiritually and then strengthen those around us Ponder the scriptures regularly and remember the thoughts and feelings you experience as you read them Seek other sources of truth as well but heed this caution from the scriptures But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God 3 Attend Church meetings especially sacrament meeting and partake of the sacrament and renew covenants including the promise to always remember the Savior that His Spirit may ever be with you No matter what mistakes we have made or how imperfect we feel we are we can always bless and lift others Reaching out to them in Christlike service can help us feel the love of God deep within our hearts It is important to remember the powerful counsel found in Deuteronomy Keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons 4Generations are affected by the choices we make Share your testimony with your family encourage them to remember how they felt when they recognized the Spirit in their lives and to record those feelings in journals and personal histories so that their own words may when needed bring to their remembrance how good the Lord has been to them You will recall that Nephi and his brothers returned to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates that contained the recorded history of their people in part so that they would not forget their past Also in the Book of Mormon Helaman named his sons after their first fathers so they would not forget the goodness of the Lord Behold my sons I desire that ye should remember to keep the commandments of God Behold I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them and when ye remember them ye may remember their works and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said and also written that they were good Therefore my sons I would that ye should do that which is good that it may be said of you and also written even as it has been said and written of them 5Many today have the same tradition of naming their children after scriptural heroes or faithful ancestors as a way of encouraging them not to forget their heritage When I was born I was given the name of Ronald A Rasband My last name honors my father s ancestral line The middle initial A was given to me to remind me to honor my mother s Danish Anderson ancestry My great great grandfather Jens Anderson was from Denmark And in 1861 the Lord led two Mormon missionaries to the Jens and Ane Cathrine Anderson home where the missionaries introduced them and their 16 year old son Andrew to the restored gospel Thus began a legacy of faith of which my family and I are the beneficiaries The Andersons read the Book of Mormon and were baptized a short time later The following year the Anderson family heeded the call of a prophet to cross the Atlantic to join the Saints in North America Sadly Jens died on the ocean voyage but his wife and son continued to the Salt Lake Valley arriving on September 3 1862 Despite their hardships and their heartaches their faith never wavered and neither has the faith of many of their descendants In my office hangs a painting6 that captures so beautifully a symbolic reminder of that first meeting between my ancestors and those dedicated early missionaries I am determined not to forget my heritage and because of my name I will forever remember their legacy of faithfulness and sacrifice Never forget question or ignore personal sacred spiritual experiences The adversary s design is to distract us from spiritual witnesses while the Lord s desire is to enlighten and engage us in His work Let me share a personal example of this truth I distinctly recall a time when I received a prompting in answer to mighty prayer The answer was clear and powerful However I failed to act immediately on the prompting and after a period of time I began to wonder if what I had felt had been real Some of you may have fallen for that deception of the adversary as well Several days later I awoke with these powerful verses of scripture in my mind Verily verily I say unto you if you desire a further witness cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter What greater witness can you have than from God 7It was as if the Lord was saying Now Ronald I already told you what you needed to do Now do it How grateful I was for that loving correction and direction I was immediately comforted by the prompting and was able to move forward knowing in my heart that my prayer had been answered I share this experience dear brothers and sisters to demonstrate how quickly our minds can forget and how spiritual experiences guide us I have learned to cherish such moments lest I forget To my friend and to all who wish to bolster their faith I give you this promise as you faithfully live the gospel of Jesus Christ and abide by its teachings your testimony will be protected and it will grow Keep the covenants you have made regardless of the actions of those around you Be diligent parents brothers and sisters grandparents aunts uncles and friends who strengthen loved ones with personal testimony and who share spiritual experiences Remain faithful and steadfast even if storms of doubt invade your lives through the actions of others Seek that which will edify and fortify you spiritually Avoid counterfeit offerings of so called truths which are so pervasive and remember to record your feelings of love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance 8In the midst of life s greatest storms do not forget your divine heritage as a son or daughter of God or your eternal destiny to one day return to live with Him which will surpass anything the world has to offer Remember the tender and sweet words of Alma Behold I say unto you my brethren if ye have experienced a change of heart and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love I would ask can ye feel so now 9To all who feel the need to have their faith fortified I plead with you do not forget Please do not forget I bear witness that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God I know he saw and talked with God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ just as he recorded in his own words How grateful I am that he did not forget to write of that experience that we may all know of his testimony I bear my solemn witness of the Lord Jesus Christ He lives I know He lives and stands at the head of this Church These things I know for myself independent of any other voice or witness and I pray that you and I will never forget sacred eternal truths first and foremost that we are sons and daughters of living and loving Heavenly Parents who desire only our eternal happiness Of these truths I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
We extend a warm welcome to the newly called General Authorities Area Seventies and the wonderful new Primary general presidency And with deepest appreciation we thank those who have been released We love you each one My dear brothers and sisters we have just participated in a most blessed experience as we have raised our hands to sustain prophets seers and revelators and other leaders and general officers called of God in these very days I have never taken lightly or casually the opportunity of sustaining and being guided by the Lord s servants And being just months into my own new calling as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles I am humbled by your sustaining vote and confidence I treasure your willingness to stand with me and with all of these great leaders Soon after I was sustained last October I traveled to Pakistan on an assignment and while there met the magnificent and dedicated Saints in that country They are few in number but large in spirit Shortly after returning home I received the following note from Brother Shakeel Arshad a dear member I had met on my visit Thank you Elder Rasband for coming to Pakistan I want to tell you that we Church members sustain you and love you We are so lucky that you were here and we heard from you It was just a golden day in my family s life that we met an Apostle 1Meeting Saints like Brother Arshad was an overwhelming and humbling experience and using his words a golden day for me as well In January Church leaders participated in a Face to Face broadcast with youth and their leaders and parents from around the world The broadcast was streamed live over the Internet to many locations in 146 countries some locations had large audiences in chapels and others were a single home with one youth tuning in In total many hundreds of thousands joined in In connecting with our vast audience Sister Bonnie Oscarson Young Women general president Brother Stephen W Owen Young Men general president and I supported by our youth hosts musicians and others answered questions from our youth Our purpose was to introduce the Mutual theme for 2016 Press Forward with a Steadfastness in Christ from 2 Nephi which reads Wherefore ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men Wherefore if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life 2By reading many hundreds of our youth s questions what did we learn We learned that our youth love the Lord sustain their leaders and desire to have their questions answered Questions are an indication of a further desire to learn to add to those truths already in place in our testimonies and to be better prepared to press forward with a steadfastness in Christ The Restoration of the gospel began with a youth Joseph Smith asking a question Many of the Savior s teachings in His ministry began with a question Remember His question to Peter Whom say ye that I am 3 And Peter s response Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God 4 We need to help each other find Heavenly Father s answers through the guidance of the Spirit At that broadcast I said to the youth The leaders of this Church are no strangers to your issues to your concerns and to your challenges We have children We have grandchildren We are often meeting with youth all over the world And we re praying for you we re talking about you in the most sacred places and we love you 5I would like to share one of the many many responses we received from that event Lisa from Grande Prairie Alberta Canada wrote This Face to Face event was wonderful What a strength to my testimony and convictions of the gospel We are so blessed to have inspired leaders who have been called to serve in so many different capacities 6Liz from Pleasant Grove Utah wrote on an earlier post I am grateful for my personal faith and the opportunity to sustain a prophet of God and the men and women who serve with him 7We have sustained leaders today who by divine inspiration have been called to teach and guide us and who are calling out to us to beware of the dangers we face each day from casual Sabbath day observance to threats to the family to assaults on religious freedom and even to disputing latter day revelation Brothers and sisters are we listening to their counsel Many times in conferences sacrament meetings and Primary we have sung the tender words Lead me guide me walk beside me 8 What do those words mean to you Who comes to mind when you think of them Have you felt the influence of righteous leaders those disciples of Jesus Christ who have in the past and continue today to touch your life who walk the Lord s path with you They may be close at home They may be in your local congregations or speaking from the pulpit at general conference These disciples share with us the blessing of having a testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ the leader of this Church the leader of our very souls who has promised Be of good cheer and do not fear for I the Lord am with you and will stand by you 9I remember President Thomas S Monson sharing the story of being invited to his stake president Paul C Child s home to prepare for advancement to the Melchizedek Priesthood What a special blessing for President Child who did not know at the time that he was teaching a young Aaronic Priesthood boy who would one day become the prophet of God 10I have had my own learning moments from our dear prophet President Monson There is no question in my mind or in my heart that he is the Lord s prophet on the earth I have been a humbled recipient as he has received revelation and acted upon it He has been teaching us to reach out to protect each other to rescue one another So it was taught at the Waters of Mormon Those desirous to be called his people were willing to bear one another s burdens to mourn with those that mourn and to stand as witnesses of God 11I stand today as a witness of God the Eternal Father and His Son Jesus Christ I know our Savior lives and loves us and directs His servants you and me to fulfill His mighty purposes on this earth 12As we press forward choosing to follow the counsel and the warnings of our leaders we choose to follow the Lord while the world is going in another direction We choose to hold fast to the iron rod to be Latter day Saints to be on the Lord s errand and to be filled with exceedingly great joy 13The growing question of today is clear are you standing with the leaders of the Church in a darkening world so that you might spread the Light of Christ Relationships with leaders are so important and significant No matter what age leaders may be how close or far away or when they may have touched our lives their influence reflects the words of the American poet Edwin Markham who said this There is a destiny that makes us brothers No one goes his way alone All that we send into the lives of othersComes back into our own 14Shakeel Arshad my friend in Pakistan sent his support to me his brother and friend So have many of you When we reach out to lift one another we prove those powerful words No one goes his way alone Most of all we need our Savior our Lord Jesus Christ One of the accounts from scripture that has always spiritually moved me is when Jesus Christ walked out on the water to meet His disciples who were traveling in a ship on the Sea of Galilee These were leaders newly called like many of us on the stand today The account is recorded in Matthew But the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with the waves for the wind was contrary And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled and they cried out for fear But straightway Jesus spake unto them saying Be of good cheer it is I be not afraid 15Peter heard that wonderful call of encouragement from the Lord And Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water And Jesus said Come 16Pretty bold Peter was a fisherman and he knew about the hazards of the sea However he was committed to following Jesus night or day on a ship or on dry land I can imagine that Peter leaped over the side of the boat not waiting for a second invitation and began to walk on the water Indeed the scripture says He walked on the water to go to Jesus 17 As the wind increased in strength and force and as the waves swirled about his feet Peter became afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying Lord save me And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him 18Such a powerful lesson The Lord was there for him just as He is there for you and for me He reached out His hand and drew Peter to Him and to safety I have needed the Savior and the rescue of His hand so many times I need Him now as never before as does each of you I have felt confident at times leaping over the side of the boat figuratively speaking into unfamiliar places only to realize that I could not do it alone As we discussed during Face to Face the Lord often reaches out to us through our families and leaders inviting us to come unto Him just like He reached out to save Peter You too will have your many moments to respond to frequent invitations to come unto Christ 19 Isn t that what this mortal life is all about The call may be to come rescue a family member come serve a mission come back to church come to the holy temple and as we have recently heard from our wonderful youth in the Face to Face event come please help me answer my question In due time each one of us will hear the call Come home I pray that we will reach out reach out and take the Savior s hand that He is extending to us often through His divinely called leaders and our family members and listen for His call to come I know that Jesus Christ lives I love Him and I know with all my heart that He loves each of us He is our great Exemplar and the divine leader of all of our Father s children Of this I bear my solemn witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen

On May 20 of last year a massive tornado pummeled the suburbs of Oklahoma City in the heartland of America carving a trail more than a mile 1 6 km wide and 17 miles 27 km long This storm an onslaught of devastating tornadoes altered the landscape and the lives of the people in its path Just a week after the massive storm struck I was assigned to visit the area where homes and belongings were strewn across the flattened ravaged neighborhoods Before I left I spoke with our beloved prophet President Thomas S Monson who relishes such errands for the Lord With respect borne not only of his office but also of his goodness I asked What do you want me to do What do you want me to say He tenderly took my hand as he would have done with each one of the victims and each of those helping with the devastation had he been there and said First tell them I love them Second tell them I am praying for them Third please thank all those who are helping As a member of the Presidency of the Seventy I could feel the weight on my shoulders in the words the Lord spoke unto Moses Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them And I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee Moses and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone 1These are words from ancient times yet the Lord s ways have not changed Currently in the Church the Lord has called 317 Seventies serving in 8 quorums to assist the Twelve Apostles in carrying the burden placed on the First Presidency I joyfully feel that responsibility in the depths of my very soul as do my fellow Brethren However we are not the only ones assisting in this glorious work As members of the Church worldwide we all have the wonderful opportunity of blessing the lives of others I had learned from our dear prophet what the storm tossed people needed love prayers and appreciation for helping hands This afternoon each of us will raise our right arm to the square and sustain the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets seers and revelators of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints This is not a mere formality nor is it reserved for those called to general service To sustain our leaders is a privilege it comes coupled with a personal responsibility to share their burden and to be disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ President Monson has said We are surrounded by those in need of our attention our encouragement our support our comfort our kindness be they family members friends acquaintances or strangers We are the Lord s hands here upon the earth with the mandate to serve and to lift His children He is dependent upon each of us Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these ye have done it unto me Matthew 25 40 2Will we respond with love when an opportunity is before us to make a visit or a phone call write a note or spend a day meeting the needs of someone else Or will we be like the young man who attested to following all of God s commandments All these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet Jesus said unto him If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me 3The young man was being called to a greater service at the side of the Lord to do the work of the kingdom of God on earth yet he turned away for he had great possessions 4What of our earthly possessions We can see what a tornado can do with them in just minutes It is so important for each of us to strive to lay up our spiritual treasures in heaven using our time talents and agency in service to God Jesus Christ continues to extend the call Come and follow me 5 He walked His homeland with His followers in a selfless manner He continues to walk with us stand by us and lead us To follow His perfect example is to recognize and honor the Savior who has borne all of our burdens through His sacred and saving Atonement the ultimate act of service What He asks of each one of us is to be able and willing to take up the joyful burden of discipleship While in Oklahoma I had the opportunity to meet with a few of the families devastated by the mighty twisters As I visited with the Sorrels family I was particularly touched by the experience of their daughter Tori then a fifth grader at Plaza Towers Elementary School She and her mother are here with us today Tori and a handful of her friends huddled in a restroom for shelter as the tornado roared through the school Listen as I read in Tori s own words the account of that day I heard something hit the roof I thought it was just hailing The sound got louder and louder I said a prayer that Heavenly Father would protect us all and keep us safe All of a sudden we heard a loud vacuum sound and the roof disappeared right above our heads There was lots of wind and debris flying around and hitting every part of my body It was darker outside and it looked like the sky was black but it wasn t it was the inside of the tornado I just closed my eyes hoping and praying that it would be over soon All of a sudden it got quiet When I opened my eyes I saw a stop sign right in front of my eyes It was almost touching my nose 6Tori her mother three of her siblings and numerous friends who were also in the school with her miraculously survived that tornado seven of their schoolmates did not That weekend the priesthood brethren gave many blessings to members who had suffered in the storm I was humbled to give Tori a blessing As I laid my hands on her head a favorite scripture came to mind I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 7I counseled Tori to remember the day when a servant of the Lord laid his hands on her head and pronounced that she had been protected by angels in the storm Reaching out to rescue one another under any condition is an eternal measure of love This is the service I witnessed in Oklahoma that week Often we are given the opportunity to help others in their time of need As members of the Church we each have the sacred responsibility to bear one another s burdens that they may be light 8 to mourn with those that mourn 9 and to lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 10Brothers and sisters how grateful the Lord is for each and every one of you for the countless hours and acts of service whether large or small you so generously and graciously give each day King Benjamin taught in the Book of Mormon When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God 11Focusing on serving our brothers and sisters can guide us to make divine decisions in our daily lives and prepares us to value and love what the Lord loves In so doing we witness by our very lives that we are His disciples When we are engaged in His work we feel His Spirit with us We grow in testimony faith trust and love I know that my Redeemer lives even Jesus Christ and that He speaks to and through His prophet dear President Thomas S Monson in this our day May we all find the joy that comes from the sacred service of bearing one another s burdens even those simple and small is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
For the past 20 months our family has been blessed with the privilege of having a very special baby Little Paxton our grandson was born with a very rare chromosomal deletion a genetic disorder that distinguishes him literally as one in hundreds of millions For our daughter and her husband an uncharted life changing journey began when Paxton was born This experience has become a crucible for learning special lessons tied to the eternities Dear Elder Russell M Nelson who just spoke to us taught For reasons usually unknown some people are born with physical limitations Specific parts of the body may be abnormal Regulatory systems may be out of balance And all of our bodies are subject to disease and death Nevertheless the gift of a physical body is priceless A perfect body is not required to achieve a divine destiny In fact some of the sweetest spirits are housed in frail frames Eventually the time will come when each spirit and body shall be reunited again in perfect form both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame Alma 11 43 Then thanks to the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can become perfected in Him 1To all of you who have challenges concerns disappointments or heartaches with a dear one know this with infinite love and everlasting compassion God our Heavenly Father loves your afflicted one and He loves you Some might ask when faced with such suffering how could Almighty God let this happen And then that seemingly inevitable question why did this happen to me Why must we experience disease and events that disable or call precious family members home early or extend their years in pain Why the heartaches At these moments we can turn to the great plan of happiness authored by our Heavenly Father That plan when presented in the pre earth life prompted us all to shout for joy 2 Put simply this life is training for eternal exaltation and that process means tests and trials It has always been so and no one is spared Trusting in God s will is central to our mortality With faith in Him we draw upon the power of Christ s Atonement at those times when questions abound and answers are few After His Resurrection when visiting the Americas our Savior Jesus Christ reached out to all with this invitation Have ye any that are sick among you Bring them hither Have ye any that are lame or blind or halt or maimed or leprous or that are withered or that are deaf or that are afflicted in any manner Bring them hither and I will heal them for I have compassion upon you my bowels are filled with mercy And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken all the multitude with one accord did go forth with their sick and their afflicted and their lame and with their blind and with their dumb and with all them that were afflicted in any manner and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him 3Great strength can be found in the words all the multitude did go forth all brothers and sisters We all face challenges And then the phrase that were afflicted in any manner All of us can identify can t we Shortly after precious Paxton was born we knew Heavenly Father would bless us and teach us special lessons As his father and I put our fingers on his tiny head in the first of many priesthood blessings the words came into my mind from the ninth chapter of John that the works of God should be made manifest in him 4God s works are definitely being made manifest through Paxton We are learning patience faith and gratitude through the balm of service endless hours of intense emotions tears of empathy and the prayers and expressions of love for dear ones in need especially Paxton and his parents President James E Faust my boyhood stake president said I have a great appreciation for those loving parents who stoically bear and overcome their anguish and heartbreak for a child who was born with or who has developed a serious mental or physical infirmity This anguish often continues every day without relief during the lifetime of the parent or the child Not infrequently parents are required to give superhuman nurturing care that never ceases day or night Many a mother s arms and heart have ached years on end giving comfort and relieving the suffering of her special child 5As described in Mosiah we have witnessed the Savior s pure love given to Paxton s family which love is available to all And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light yea the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord 6One night early in Paxton s life we were in the neonatal intensive care unit of the wonderful Primary Children s Medical Center in Salt Lake City Utah marveling at the dedicated undivided attention given by the doctors nurses and caregivers I asked my daughter how we would ever pay for this and ventured a guess at what the cost would be A doctor standing nearby suggested that I was way low and that little Paxton s care would cost substantially more than I had estimated We learned that much of the expense for care given in this hospital is covered by the generous gifts of time and monetary contributions of others His words humbled me as I thought of the worth of this tiny little soul to those who were so carefully watching over him I was reminded of a familiar missionary scripture that took on new meaning Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God 7I wept as I pondered the limitless love our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ have for each one of us while learning in a powerful way what the worth of a soul is both physically and spiritually to God Paxton s family has learned they are surrounded by countless heavenly and earthly ministering angels Some have quietly slipped in when needed and silently slipped out Others have been at the door with food doing the laundry picking up the siblings calling with encouragement and especially praying for Paxton Thus another special lesson learned If you come upon a person who is drowning would you ask if they need help or would it be better to just jump in and save them from the deepening waters The offer while well meaning and often given Let me know if I can help is really no help at all We continue to learn the important value of being aware of and interested in the lives of those around us learning not only the importance of giving help but also the overwhelming joy that comes from helping others Dear President Thomas S Monson who is such a magnificent example of lifting the downtrodden said God bless all who endeavor to be their brother s keeper who give to ameliorate suffering who strive with all that is good within them to make a better world Have you noticed that such individuals have a brighter smile Their footsteps are more certain They have an aura about them of contentment and satisfaction for one cannot participate in helping others without experiencing a rich blessing himself 8Though we will face trials adversities disabilities heartaches and all manner of afflictions our caring loving Savior will always be there for us He has promised I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you My peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid 9How grateful we are to our Father in Heaven for our champion Paxton Through him the Lord has manifest His works and continues to teach us these valuable sacred and special lessons I would like to close with the words from a beloved hymn We are all enlisted till the conflict is o er Happy are we Happy are we Soldiers in the army there s a bright crown in store We shall win and wear it by and by 10Brothers and sisters it is my hope and prayer that we will continue to bear nobly our burdens and to reach out to those among us who are suffering and in need of being lifted and encouraged May we each thank God for His blessings and renew our commitment to our Father in Heaven of humble service to His children In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Good evening my dear brethren of the priesthood Tonight I would like to speak about missionary service I direct my comments to the vast army of young men who hold the Aaronic Priesthood who are gathered throughout the entire world and to their fathers grandfathers and priesthood leaders who watch over them Missionary work is a subject very close to my heart as it is to every member of the eight Quorums of the Seventy whom the Lord has appointed to go before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come 1 Missionary work is the lifeblood of the Church and the lifesaving blessing to all who accept its message When the Master ministered among men He called fishermen at Galilee to leave their nets and follow Him declaring I will make you fishers of men 2 The Lord extended those calls to humble men so that through them others would hear the truths of His gospel and come unto Him In June of 1837 the Prophet Joseph Smith called Heber C Kimball an Apostle to go on a mission to England Elder Kimball s call came as the two sat in the Kirtland Temple and Joseph spoke with divine authority Brother Heber the Spirit of the Lord has whispered to me Let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my gospel and open the door of salvation to that nation 3That whispering of the Spirit is an example of how the call comes to servants of the Lord to send missionaries to their fields of labor Today missionaries go forth two by two as appointed by the Lord carrying that same message with the same divine call to serve from the prophet of God Our prophet President Thomas S Monson has said of those called to serve The missionary opportunity of a lifetime is yours The blessings of eternity await you Yours is the privilege to be not spectators but participants on the stage of priesthood service 4The stage is yours my dear Aaronic Priesthood boys Are you ready and willing to play your part The Lord needs every able young man to prepare and recommit starting tonight to be worthy of a call from the prophet of God to serve a mission I remember fondly our entire family s great joy when two of our children received their calls to serve as full time missionaries Excitement and anticipation filled our hearts as they each opened their special letter from the prophet of God Our daughter Jenessa was called to the Michigan Detroit Mission and our son Christian was called to the Russia Moscow South Mission What humbling and thrilling experiences all at the same time As Sister Rasband and I had the privilege of presiding over the New York New York North Mission several years ago I marveled as the missionaries arrived in New York City As I interviewed them on their first day in the mission I had a profound sense of gratitude for each missionary I felt that their call to our mission was divinely designed for them and for me as their mission president After finishing our mission assignment I was called by President Gordon B Hinckley to serve as a Seventy in the Church Part of my early training as a new General Authority included an opportunity to sit with members of the Twelve as they assigned missionaries to serve in one of the 300 plus missions of this great Church With the encouragement and permission of President Henry B Eyring I would like to relate to you an experience very special to me which I had with him several years ago when he was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Each Apostle holds the keys of the kingdom and exercises them at the direction and assignment of the President of the Church Elder Eyring was assigning missionaries to their fields of labor and as part of my training I was invited to observe I joined Elder Eyring early one morning in a room where several large computer screens had been prepared for the session There was also a staff member from the Missionary Department who had been assigned to assist us that day First we knelt together in prayer I remember Elder Eyring using very sincere words asking the Lord to bless him to know perfectly where the missionaries should be assigned The word perfectly said much about the faith that Elder Eyring exhibited that day As the process began a picture of the missionary to be assigned would come up on one of the computer screens As each picture appeared to me it was as if the missionary were in the room with us Elder Eyring would then greet the missionary with his kind and endearing voice Good morning Elder Reier or Sister Yang How are you today He told me that in his own mind he liked to think of where the missionaries would conclude their mission This would aid him to know where they were to be assigned Elder Eyring would then study the comments from the bishops and stake presidents medical notes and other issues relating to each missionary He then referred to another screen which displayed areas and missions across the world Finally as he was prompted by the Spirit he would assign the missionary to his or her field of labor From others of the Twelve I have learned that this general method is typical each week as Apostles of the Lord assign scores of missionaries to serve throughout the world Having served as a missionary in my own country in the Eastern States Mission a number of years ago I was deeply moved by this experience Also having served as a mission president I was grateful for a further witness in my heart that the missionaries I had received in New York City were sent to me by revelation After assigning a few missionaries Elder Eyring turned to me as he pondered one particular missionary and said So Brother Rasband where do you think this missionary should go I was startled I quietly suggested to Elder Eyring that I did not know and that I did not know I could know He looked at me directly and simply said Brother Rasband pay closer attention and you too can know With that I pulled my chair a little closer to Elder Eyring and the computer screen and I did pay much closer attention A couple of other times as the process moved along Elder Eyring would turn to me and say Well Brother Rasband where do you feel this missionary should go I would name a particular mission and Elder Eyring would look at me thoughtfully and say No that s not it He would then continue to assign the missionaries where he had felt prompted As we were nearing the completion of that assignment meeting a picture of a certain missionary appeared on the screen I had the strongest prompting the strongest of the morning that the missionary we had before us was to be assigned to Japan I did not know that Elder Eyring was going to ask me on this one but amazingly he did I rather tentatively and humbly said to him Japan Elder Eyring responded immediately Yes let s go there And up on the computer screen the missions of Japan appeared I instantly knew that the missionary was to go to the Japan Sapporo Mission Elder Eyring did not ask me the exact name of the mission but he did assign that missionary to the Japan Sapporo Mission Privately in my heart I was deeply touched and sincerely grateful to the Lord for allowing me to experience the prompting to know where that missionary should go At the end of the meeting Elder Eyring bore his witness to me of the love of the Savior which He has for each missionary assigned to go out into the world and preach the restored gospel He said that it is by the great love of the Savior that His servants know where these wonderful young men and women senior missionaries and senior couple missionaries are to serve I had a further witness that morning that every missionary called in this Church and assigned or reassigned to a particular mission is called by revelation from the Lord God Almighty through one of these His servants I conclude with the Lord s words to the Whitmer brothers who had a profound role in the early days of the Restoration They were witnesses to the gold plates and their signed testimonies are included at the front of every copy of the Book of Mormon They were among the first band of missionaries called by a prophet of God in 1829 to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ In the preface to section 14 of the Doctrine and Covenants it states Three of the Whitmer sons each having received a testimony as to the genuineness of the work became deeply concerned over the matter of their individual duty To John and Peter Whitmer Jr the Lord said this For many times you have desired of me to know that which would be of the most worth unto you 5I suppose many of you young men have asked yourselves that same question Here is the Lord s answer And now behold I say unto you that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people that you may bring souls unto me that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father 6At this time in your life a mission call from the Lord my young friends is the most important work that you can do Prepare now live righteously learn from your family and Church leaders and come join with us in building the kingdom of God on earth accept your divine appointment in so great a cause 7 This is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I would like to add my testimony and witness on this special day that President Thomas S Monson is the Lord s prophet on the earth I am grateful to have this privilege to speak in general conference I am grateful as you are for the experience we have in this historic conference as we sustain in an orderly and patterned way our new prophet First Presidency and other leaders of the Church This kind of experience fortifies our testimonies and increases our faith in the knowledge that this is indeed the Lord s true and living Church Our personal journey through life provides us with many special experiences that become building blocks of faith and testimony These experiences come to us in vastly different ways and at unpredictable times They can be powerful spiritual events or small enlightening moments Some experiences will come as serious challenges and heavy trials that test our ability to cope with them No matter what the experience may be each gives us a chance for personal growth greater wisdom and in many cases service to others with more empathy and love As the Lord stated to the Prophet Joseph Smith in a reassuring way during one of his most significant trials at Liberty Jail All these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good D C 122 7 As experiences accumulate in our lives they add strength and support to each other Just as the building blocks of our homes support the rest of the structure so too do our personal life experiences become building blocks for our testimonies and add to our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ This very conference session illustrates the value of a life full of experiences As we follow the wise counsel of our leaders and marvel at their teachings and spirit is it any wonder that the Lord chooses His senior Apostle after years of preparation to become His chosen prophet My patriarchal blessing indicates that I would be given special experiences that would strengthen my own testimony Brothers and sisters think of the special experiences you have been blessed with in your life that have given you conviction and joy in your heart Remember when you first knew that Joseph Smith was God s prophet of the Restoration Remember when you accepted Moroni s challenge and knew that the Book of Mormon was indeed another testament of Jesus Christ Remember when you received an answer to fervent prayer and realized that your Heavenly Father knows and loves you personally As you contemplate such special experiences don t they give you a sense of gratitude and resolve to go forward with renewed faith and determination Not long ago Sister Rasband and I had an experience we shall never forget I was assigned to preside at two stake conferences in Peru While there we went to the city of Puno high in the Andes Mountains on Lake Titicaca At 12 000 feet 3 660 m above sea level we were amazed at this simple and beautiful city high on this Andean lake We met with stake presidents in the area and had a wonderful youth fireside with hundreds of young people from the Puno area One morning we were invited to visit a small group of local members who lived out on the floating reed islands of Lake Titicaca The people who live there are known as the Uros Indians of Bolivia and Peru We were told that a few Latter day Saint families had joined together and built their own small new floating island With excitement we took a boat out to the island and were greeted warmly by these wonderful members We held their babies wrapped in the most beautiful colorful handmade blankets We ate the fish they caught that very day from the lake which had been so carefully prepared and generously shared We saw their wares and handicrafts and exchanged gifts with one another As we visited we learned that their children paddled by canoe 45 minutes to and from Puno for seminary and school each day We were also pleased that these members knew the scriptures well understood them and loved them Eagerly they showed us their current temple recommends having been endowed and sealed in the Cochabamba Bolivia Temple Before we were to leave one of the mothers asked if we would kneel with them and have a family prayer I remember well kneeling on the spongy reeds with these faithful Saints As we knelt she asked if I would say the prayer and using the Melchizedek Priesthood dedicate their new island and home I was deeply humbled that there on the floating islands of Lake Titicaca these faithful Latter day Saint families would ask me to pray for the little island of Apu Inti and ask the Lord to bless the homes and families of the Lujanos and Jallahuis As I consider this special experience that the Lord blessed us with I know a new building block has been added to my house of faith I often think of that experience in Puno as another reminder of the fulfillment of my own patriarchal blessing From the preface of the Doctrine and Covenants written in 1831 foretelling the expansion of the Lord s work in our day the Lord revealed But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord even the Savior of the world That faith also might increase in the earth That mine everlasting covenant might be established That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world D C 1 20 23 Brothers and sisters the weak and the simple members of the Church like you and me are taking the gospel to the ends of the earth to Puno Peru and other far off places Faith is increasing among God s covenant people and I believe it is through having a personal treasury of such valued experiences that an increase of faith can happen for each of us President Monson said The Lord commands And to those who obey Him whether they be wise or simple He will reveal Himself in the toils the conflicts the sufferings which they shall pass through in His fellowship and they shall learn in their own experience Who He is in The Way of the Master Liahona and Ensign Jan 2003 7 quoting Albert Schweitzer The Quest of the Historical Jesus 1948 401 emphasis added In these days of worldly intrusions into our lives when trials and difficulties may seem to engulf us let us remember our own special spiritual experiences These building blocks of faith will bring us conviction and reassurance of a caring loving Father in Heaven of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and of Their restored true and living Church I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Good evening my dear brethren of the priesthood Tonight throughout the world we are gathered nearer to the temples of the Lord than ever before in the history of mankind Through the loving kindness of our Savior in directing His prophets 122 temples are now accessible to the Lord s covenant people to obtain their own temple blessings and perform vital ordinances for their departed ancestors And more have been announced and are coming We thank you President Hinckley for your inspired leadership in this tremendous effort In an early Book of Mormon time the members of the Church also gathered near a temple to receive instruction from their prophet and leader Late in his life King Benjamin called upon fathers to bring their families together to give them counsel and admonitions From Mosiah we read And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple they pitched their tents round about every man according to his family Every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which King Benjamin should speak unto them Mosiah 2 5 6 I love the imagery of these verses Figuratively speaking brethren are the doors of our homes pitched towards the temples we so love Do we attend as often as we can showing our children through our example the importance of these sacred and special places As recorded in Mosiah families received the word of the Lord through their prophet with enthusiasm and commitment The people were so moved by King Benjamin s teachings that they entered into a new covenant to follow the Lord Jesus Christ However there is a sad epilogue to this story We learn later in Mosiah concerning those who were but little children in the tents at the time of King Benjamin s sermon Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin being little children at the time he spake unto his people and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers Mosiah 26 1 What happened to that rising generation brethren Why didn t the young children accept the righteous traditions of their fathers More importantly here we are centuries later in a day of many temples and constant prophetic direction and what of our rising generation Do we have reason to be concerned Certainly we do The young men here and throughout the world and their young women counterparts are very special President Hinckley has spoken of them I have said many times that I believe we have the finest generation of young people that this Church has ever known They try to do the right thing They are bright and able clean and fresh attractive and smart They know what the gospel is about and they are trying to live it looking to the Lord for His guidance and help Your Greatest Challenge Mother Liahona Jan 2001 113 Ensign Nov 2000 97 98 All of us who are involved with these youth know the truth of President Hinckley s words Elder Henry B Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles however provides us with a somber warning speaking of the youth Many of them are remarkable in their spiritual maturity and in their faith But even the best of them are sorely tested And the testing will become more severe We Must Raise Our Sights Ensign Sept 2004 14 This warning that the testing will become more severe gets my attention Our rising generation is worthy of our best efforts to support and strengthen them in their journey to adulthood In these perilous times as our youth are faced with this increased adversity we can learn from others In the armed forces particularly in all the navies throughout the world every seaman understands one phrase that is a clarion call for immediate help no matter what he is doing or where he is on the ship The call is All hands on deck Many a battle at sea has been won or lost by the response to this call We as members of the Church leaders of youth anxious fathers and concerned grandfathers all need to respond to the call for all hands on deck as it pertains to our youth and young single adults We must all look for opportunities to bless the youth whether or not we are currently closely associated with them We must continue to teach and fortify fathers and mothers in their divinely declared roles with their children in the home We must ask ourselves constantly if that extra sporting event that extra activity or errand outside of the home is more important than families being together at home Now is the time brethren when in every action we take in every place we go with every Latter day Saint young person we meet we need to have an increased awareness of the need for strengthening nurturing and being an influence for good in their lives In our own family we have had such an experience with wonderful watchful priesthood leaders When I was first called to the Seventy some years ago we were assigned to move to Solihull England to serve in the Area Presidency Sister Rasband and I took our two youngest children with us on this assignment Our daughter was a young single adult and our son a 17 year old who liked American style football and played it very well We were very concerned about them No friends no extended family and no American football I wondered Would this exciting new experience prove to be a serious trial for our family The answer came in an early assignment I received I had been asked to speak to the missionaries at the Missionary Training Center in Preston England I called President White of the center and was pleased to hear that he knew of my family situation He suggested we include our children on our visit to Preston Once we were there he even invited our daughter and son to speak to the missionaries What a thrill for them to be and feel included and share their testimonies of the Lord s work When finished and after tender good byes to those missionaries we visited the beautiful Preston England Temple which was close to the Missionary Training Center As we walked near the front door there stood President and Sister Swanney the temple president and matron They greeted us and welcomed us into the temple with Elder Rasband how would you and your family like to perform baptisms for the dead What a wonderful idea We looked at each other and gratefully accepted After performing the ordinances and while my son and I were still in the font with tears of joy in our eyes he put his hand on my shoulder and asked Dad why haven t we ever done this before I thought of all the football games all the movies we had attended together all of the good times we had shared certainly happy memories and traditions that are so important to build However I realized we had an opportunity to add more meaningful spiritual experiences with our children like what we had experienced in Preston that day Thanks to those caring and observant priesthood leaders I knew then that our family was going to do fine in Europe How grateful we are for the many priesthood and Young Women leaders who have always been watchful and loving to our children and yours Looking to another Book of Mormon time Nephi lived in a situation where some members of his family struggled with obedience harmony and faithfulness He most certainly understood the necessity for attentive commitment to children of the rising generation He said late in his life And we talk of Christ we rejoice in Christ we preach of Christ we prophesy of Christ and we write according to our prophecies that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins 2 Ne 25 26 I pray that as the holders of the priesthood of God we may each of us do all things that lie in our power to teach our youth what source they may look to for a remission of their sins even the Lord Jesus Christ May we each respond with our most sincere efforts to all hands on deck as it pertains to saving our own rising generation they are certainly worth our very best efforts I testify that this is the Lord s true Church directed by Him through our dear prophet even Gordon B Hinckley whom I love and sustain In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters I feel it a great privilege and honor to stand here at this pulpit today I pray for the blessing of the Holy Spirit that what I say may add to the spiritual feelings we all experience at conference time I would be very ungrateful if I did not take this opportunity to thank the Lord in all sincerity for my calling as a Seventy I would also like to thank our dear prophet President Hinckley and his fellow leaders of the Church for their confidence in me I pledge to them and all of you my best efforts in the years of service that lie before me Through many hours of reflection I have been drawn back to my pioneer ancestors in deep appreciation All eight of my great grandparents came into the Church as early converts Six of the eight immigrated to the United States from Europe where I am now serving I feel a deep sense of love and connection to the European Saints and commit myself to do all that I possibly can to strengthen the Church and build up the kingdom of God there or wherever I may be assigned I express my love and gratitude to my dear eternal companion and choice family for their devoted support and love I wish to convey my love to our friends and dear missionaries whom we recently served with in the New York New York North Mission One of the great blessings of my life is that of treasured friends and close associates that I have had the privilege to know and learn from Throughout my life I have come to know through my own experiences that Heavenly Father hears and answers our personal prayers I know that Jesus is the living Christ and that He knows each of us individually or as the scriptures express it one by one This sacred assurance is taught compassionately by the Savior Himself in His appearance to the people of Nephi We read of this in 3 Nephi chapter 11 verse 15 And it came to pass that the multitude went forth and thrust their hands into his side and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet and this they did do going forth one by one until they had all gone forth 3 Ne 11 15 emphasis added To further illustrate the one by one nature of our Savior s ministry we read in 3 Nephi chapter 17 verse 9 And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken all the multitude with one accord did go forth with their sick and their afflicted and their lame and with their blind and with their dumb and with all them that were afflicted in any manner and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him 3 Ne 17 9 emphasis added We then read of the special blessing given to the precious children in verse 21 And when he had said these words he wept and the multitude bare record of it and he took their little children one by one and blessed them and prayed unto the Father for them 3 Ne 17 21 emphasis added This was not a small gathering In verse 25 3 Ne 17 25 we read And they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls and they did consist of men women and children Certainly there is a very profound and tender personal message here Jesus Christ ministers to and loves us all one by one As we reflect on our Savior s way of loving we sustain you dedicated stake and ward leaders men and women of great faith We gratefully recognize the many efforts of those of you working with the youth And we express great appreciation to our caring Primary leaders and teachers for your Christlike service We consider each of your one by one ministries and say thank you and please please continue Perhaps never in the history of mankind do we need to be serving on a one by one basis more than we do now During the final months of our mission last year we experienced an event that taught once again this profound principle that each of us is known and loved by God Elder Neal A Maxwell was coming to New York City for some Church business and we were informed that he would also like to have a mission conference We were so pleased to have this opportunity to hear from one of the Lord s chosen servants I was asked to select one of our missionaries to provide the opening prayer for the meeting I might have randomly picked one of the missionaries to pray but felt to ponder and prayerfully select one whom the Lord would have me ask In going through the missionary roster a name boldly stood out to me Elder Joseph Appiah of Accra Ghana He was the one I felt the Lord wanted to pray at the meeting Prior to the mission conference I was having a regularly scheduled interview with Elder Appiah and told him of the prompting that I had received for him to pray With amazement and humility in his eyes he began to weep deeply Somewhat surprised by his reaction I started to tell him that it was all right and he wouldn t have to pray when he informed me he would love to offer the prayer that his emotion was caused by the love he has for Elder Maxwell He told me that this Apostle is very special to the Saints in Ghana and to his own family Elder Maxwell had called his father to be the district president in Accra and had sealed his mother and father in the Salt Lake Temple Now I didn t know any of what I just related about this missionary or his family but the Lord did and inspired a mission president on behalf of one missionary to provide a lifelong memory and testimony building experience At the meeting Elder Appiah offered a wonderful prayer and made a humble contribution to a meeting where Elder Maxwell taught the missionaries of the attributes of Jesus Christ All who were there will never forget the feelings of love they experienced for their Savior I have a testimony in my heart brothers and sisters that God our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know and love us individually I m not sure I fully understand how I just know and have experienced that They do I urge all of us in our own ministries to our families and to our fellowman to embrace the Savior s warm invitation to come unto Him one by one and be perfected in Him I share this witness and hope in the name of Jesus Christ amen
