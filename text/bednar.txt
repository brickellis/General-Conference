In the Sacred Grove 200 years ago young Joseph Smith saw and talked with God the Eternal Father and His Son Jesus Christ From Them Joseph learned about the true nature of the Godhead and of ongoing revelation as this supernal vision ushered in the latter day dispensation of the fulness of times 1Approximately three years later in response to earnest prayer on the evening of September 21 1823 Joseph s bedroom filled with light until it was lighter than at noonday 2 A personage appeared at his bedside called the young boy by name and declared he was a messenger sent from the presence of God and that his name was Moroni 3 He instructed Joseph about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon And then Moroni quoted from the book of Malachi in the Old Testament with a little variation in the language used in the King James Version Behold I will reveal unto you the Priesthood by the hand of Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers If it were not so the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming 4Importantly Moroni s instruction to Joseph Smith about Elijah s mission initiated temple and family history work in the latter days and was a key element in restoring all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began 5I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we learn together about the covenants ordinances and blessings that are available to us in the temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints The Return of ElijahI begin by asking a fundamental question why was the return of Elijah important We learn from latter day revelation that Elijah held the sealing power of the Melchizedek Priesthood 6 and was the last prophet to do so before the time of Jesus Christ 7The Prophet Joseph Smith explained The spirit power and calling of Elijah is that ye have power to hold the key of the fullness of the Melchizedek Priesthood and to obtain all the ordinances belonging to the kingdom of God even unto the turning of the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are in heaven 8This sacred sealing authority is necessary so that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven 9Joseph further clarified How shall God come to the rescue of this generation He will send Elijah the prophet Elijah shall reveal the covenants to seal the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers 10Elijah appeared with Moses on the Mount of Transfiguration and conferred this authority upon Peter James and John 11 Elijah also appeared with Moses and Elias on April 3 1836 in the Kirtland Temple and conferred the same priesthood keys upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery 12The restoration of the sealing authority by Elijah in 1836 was necessary to prepare the world for the Savior s Second Coming and initiated a greatly increased and worldwide interest in family history research Changing Turning and Purifying HeartsThe word heart is used over 1 000 times in the standard works This simple but significant word often denotes the inner feelings of an individual Our hearts the sum total of our desires affections intentions motives and attitudes define who we are and determine what we will become And the essence of the Lord s work is changing turning and purifying hearts through gospel covenants and priesthood ordinances We do not build or enter holy temples solely to have a memorable individual or family experience Rather the covenants received and the ordinances performed in temples are essential to the sanctifying of our hearts and for the ultimate exaltation of God s sons and daughters Planting in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers even Abraham Isaac and Jacob turning the hearts of the children to their own fathers conducting family history research and performing vicarious temple ordinances are labors that bless individuals on both sides of the veil As we become anxiously engaged in this sacred work we are obeying the commandments to love and serve God and our neighbors 13 And such selfless service helps us truly to Hear Him 14 and come unto the Savior 15The most sacred covenants and priesthood ordinances are received only in a temple the house of the Lord Everything that is learned and all that is done in the temple emphasize the divinity of Jesus Christ and His role in Heavenly Father s great plan of happiness From the Inside OutPresident Ezra Taft Benson described an important pattern the Redeemer employs in bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 16 He said The Lord works from the inside out The world works from the outside in The world would take people out of the slums Christ takes the slums out of people and then they take themselves out of the slums The world would mold men by changing their environment Christ changes men who then change their environment The world would shape human behavior but Christ can change human nature 17Covenants and priesthood ordinances are central in the ongoing process of spiritual rebirth and transformation they are the means whereby the Lord works with each of us from the inside out Covenants that are honored steadfastly remembered always and written with the Spirit of the living God in fleshy tables of the heart 18 provide purpose and the assurance of blessings in mortality and for eternity Ordinances that are received worthily and remembered continually open the heavenly channels through which the power of godliness can flow into our lives We do not come to the temple to hide from or escape the evils of the world Rather we come to the temple to conquer the world of evil As we invite into our lives the power of godliness 19 by receiving priesthood ordinances and making and keeping sacred covenants we are blessed with strength beyond our own20 to overcome the temptations and challenges of mortality and to do and become good The Fame of This House Shall SpreadThe first temple of this dispensation was constructed in Kirtland Ohio and dedicated on March 27 1836 In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith one week after the dedication the Lord declared Let the hearts of all my people rejoice who have with their might built this house to my name Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my people 21Please note the phrases the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice and the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands These were stunning declarations in April of 1836 when the Church had only a relative handful of members and one temple Today in 2020 we have 168 operating temples Forty nine additional temples are under construction or have been announced Houses of the Lord are being constructed on the isles of the sea 22 and in countries and locations previously considered by many unlikely to warrant a temple The endowment ceremony currently is presented in 88 languages and will become available in many additional languages as temples are built to bless more of God s children In the next 15 years the number of languages in which temple ordinances will be available likely will double This year we will break ground and start construction on 18 temples In contrast it took 150 years to build the first 18 temples from the organization of the Church in 1830 to the dedication of the Tokyo Japan Temple by President Spencer W Kimball in 1980 Consider the hastening of temple work that has occurred just during the lifetime of President Russell M Nelson When President Nelson was born on September 9 1924 the Church had six operating temples When he was ordained an Apostle on April 7 1984 60 years later 26 temples were operating an increase of 20 temples in 60 years When President Nelson was sustained as President of the Church 159 temples were operating an increase of 133 temples in the 34 years during which he served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Since becoming the President of the Church on January 14 2018 President Nelson has announced 35 new temples Ninety six percent of the existing temples have been dedicated during President Nelson s lifetime 84 percent have been dedicated since he was ordained an Apostle Always Focus on the Things That Matter MostAs members of the Lord s restored Church we stand all amazed at the ever accelerating pace of His work in the latter days And more temples are coming Brigham Young prophesied To accomplish this work there will have to be not only one temple but thousands of them and thousands and tens of thousands of men and women will go into those temples and officiate for people who have lived as far back as the Lord shall reveal 23Understandably the announcement of each new temple is a source of great joy and a reason to give thanks to the Lord However our primary focus should be on the covenants and ordinances that can change our hearts and deepen our devotion to the Savior and not simply on the location or beauty of the building The fundamental obligations that rest upon us as members of the Lord s restored Church are 1 to Hear Him 24 and have our own hearts changed through covenants and ordinances and 2 to fulfill joyfully the divinely appointed responsibility to offer temple blessings to the entire human family on both sides of the veil With the Lord s direction and help indeed we will fulfill these sacred duties The Building Up of ZionThe Prophet Joseph Smith declared The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age it is a theme upon which prophets priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day but they died without the sight it is left for us to see participate in and help to roll forward the Latter day glory 25 The heavenly Priesthood will unite with the earthly to bring about those great purposes a work that God and angels have contemplated with delight for generations past that fired the souls of the ancient patriarchs and prophets a work that is destined to bring about the destruction of the powers of darkness the renovation of the earth the glory of God and the salvation of the human family 26I solemnly testify that the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith and Elijah restored the sealing authority Sacred temple covenants and ordinances can strengthen us and purify our hearts as we Hear Him 27 and receive the power of godliness in our lives And I witness that this latter day work will destroy the powers of darkness and bring about the salvation of the human family Of these truths I joyfully testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
I earnestly pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost for you and for me as we rejoice and worship together In April of 1976 Elder Boyd K Packer spoke specifically to the youth of the Church in general conference In his classic message entitled Spiritual Crocodiles he described how during an assignment in Africa he observed well camouflaged crocodiles waiting to prey on unsuspecting victims He then likened the crocodiles to Satan who preys on unwary youth by camouflaging the deadly nature of sin I was 23 years old when Elder Packer gave that talk and Susan and I were anticipating the birth of our first child in just a few days We were impressed with the content of his message about avoiding sin and the masterful way he used the ordinary behavior of animals to teach an important spiritual lesson Susan and I also have traveled to Africa on many assignments And we have had opportunities to see the magnificent animals that live on that continent Remembering the impact of Elder Packer s talk in our lives we have tried to observe and learn lessons from the behavior of African wildlife I want to describe the characteristics and tactics of two cheetahs Susan and I watched hunting their prey and relate some of the things we observed to the daily living of the gospel of Jesus Christ Cheetahs and TopisCheetahs are the fastest land animals on earth and reach running speeds as high as 75 mph 120 km h These beautiful animals can accelerate from a standstill position to running as fast as 68 mph 109 km h in less than three seconds Cheetahs are predators that sneak up on their prey and sprint a short distance to chase and attack Susan and I spent almost two hours watching two cheetahs stalking a large group of topis Africa s most common and widespread antelopes The tall dry grass of the African savanna was golden brown and almost totally obscured the predators as they pursued a group of topis The cheetahs were separated from each other by approximately 100 yards 91 m but worked in tandem While one cheetah sat upright in the grass and did not move the other cheetah crouched low to the ground and slowly crept closer to the unsuspecting topis Then the cheetah that had been sitting upright disappeared in the grass at exactly the same moment that the other cheetah sat upright This alternating pattern of one cheetah crouching low and creeping forward while the other cheetah sat upright in the grass continued for a long time The stealthy subtlety of the strategy was intended to distract and deceive the topis and thereby divert their attention away from the approaching danger Patiently and steadily the two cheetahs worked as a team to secure their next meal Positioned between the large group of topis and the approaching cheetahs were several older and stronger topis standing as sentinels on termite mounds The enhanced view of the grasslands from the small hills enabled these guardian topis to watch for signs of danger Then suddenly as the cheetahs appeared to be within striking distance the entire group of topis turned and ran away I do not know if or how the sentinel topis communicated with the larger group but somehow a warning was given and all the topis moved to a place of safety And what did the cheetahs do next Without any delay the two cheetahs resumed their alternating pattern of one cheetah crouching low and creeping forward while the other cheetah sat upright in the grass The pattern of pursuit continued They did not stop They did not rest or take a break They were relentless in following their strategy of distraction and diversion Susan and I watched the cheetahs disappear in the distance always moving closer and closer to the group of topis That night Susan and I had a memorable conversation about what we had observed and learned We also discussed this experience with our children and grandchildren and identified many valuable lessons I now will describe three of those lessons Lesson 1 Beware of Evil s Beguiling DisguisesTo me cheetahs are sleek alluring and captivating creatures A cheetah s yellowish tan to greyish white coat with black spots acts as a beautiful disguise that makes these animals almost invisible as they stalk their prey in the African grasslands In a similar way spiritually dangerous ideas and actions frequently can appear to be attractive desirable or pleasurable Thus in our contemporary world each of us needs to be aware of beguiling bad that pretends to be good As Isaiah warned Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter 1In a paradoxical period when violating the sanctity of human life is heralded as a right and chaos is described as liberty how blessed we are to live in this latter day dispensation when restored gospel light can shine brightly in our lives and help us to discern the adversary s dark deceptions and distractions For they that are wise and have received the truth and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide and have not been deceived verily I say unto you they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire but shall abide the day 2Lesson 2 Stay Awake and Be AlertFor a topi a brief moment of carelessness or inattentiveness could invite a swift attack from a cheetah Likewise spiritual complacency and casualness make us vulnerable to the advances of the adversary Spiritual thoughtlessness invites great danger into our lives iStock com AngelikaNephi described how in the latter days Satan would attempt to pacify and lull the children of God into a false sense of carnal security that they will say All is well in Zion yea Zion prospereth all is well and thus the devil cheateth their souls and leadeth them away carefully down to hell 3Constant vigilance is required to counteract complacency and casualness To be vigilant is the state or action of keeping careful watch for possible danger or difficulties And keeping watch denotes the act of staying awake to guard and protect Spiritually speaking we need to stay awake and be alert to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the signals that come from the Lord s watchmen on the towers 4 Yea and I also exhort you that ye be watchful unto prayer continually that ye may not be led away by the temptations of the devil for behold he rewardeth you no good thing 5Focusing our lives in and on the Savior and His gospel enables us to overcome the tendency of the natural man to be spiritually snoozy and lazy As we are blessed with eyes to see and ears to hear 6 the Holy Ghost can increase our capacity to look and listen when we may not typically think we need to look or listen or when we may not think anything can be seen or heard Watch therefore that ye may be ready 7Lesson 3 Understand the Intent of the EnemyA cheetah is a predator that naturally preys on other animals All day every day a cheetah is a predator Satan is the enemy of righteousness and of those who seek to do the will of God 8 All day every day his only intent and sole purpose are to make the sons and daughters of God miserable like unto himself 9The Father s plan of happiness is designed to provide direction for His children to help them experience enduring joy and to bring them safely home to Him with resurrected exalted bodies The devil labors to make the sons and daughters of God confused and unhappy and to hinder their eternal progression The adversary works relentlessly to attack the elements of the Father s plan he hates the most Satan does not have a body and his eternal progress has been halted Just as water flowing in a riverbed is stopped by a dam so the adversary s eternal progress is thwarted because he does not have a physical body Because of his rebellion Lucifer has denied himself all of the mortal blessings and experiences made possible through a tabernacle of flesh and bones One of the potent scriptural meanings of the word damned is illustrated in his inability to continue progressing and becoming like our Heavenly Father Because a physical body is so central to the Father s plan of happiness and our spiritual development Lucifer seeks to frustrate our progression by tempting us to use our bodies improperly President Russell M Nelson has taught that spiritual safety ultimately lies in never taking the first enticing step toward going where you should not go and doing what you should not do As human beings we all have physical appetites necessary for our survival These appetites are absolutely essential for the perpetuation of life So what does the adversary do He attacks us through our appetites He tempts us to eat things we should not eat to drink things we should not drink and to love as we should not love 10One of the ultimate ironies of eternity is that the adversary who is miserable precisely because he has no physical body invites and entices us to share in his misery through the improper use of our bodies The very tool he does not have and cannot use is thus the primary target of his attempts to lure us to physical and spiritual destruction Understanding the intent of an enemy is vital to effective preparation for possible attacks 11 Precisely because Captain Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites he was prepared to meet them at the time of their coming and was victorious 12 And that same principle and promise applies to each of us If ye are prepared ye shall not fear And that ye might escape the power of the enemy 13Invitation Promise and TestimonyJust as important lessons can be learned by observing the behavior of cheetahs and topis so each of us should look for the lessons and warnings found in the simple events of everyday life As we seek for a mind and heart open to receive heavenly direction by the power of the Holy Ghost then some of the greatest instructions that we can receive and many of the most powerful warnings that can safeguard us will originate in our own ordinary experiences Powerful parables are contained in both the scriptures and in our daily lives I have highlighted only three of the many lessons that can be identified in the adventure Susan and I had in Africa I invite and encourage you to reflect on this episode with the cheetahs and the topis and identify additional lessons for you and your family Please remember always that your home is the true center of gospel learning and living As you respond in faith to this invitation inspired thoughts will come to your mind spiritual feelings will swell in your heart and you will recognize actions that should be undertaken or continued so that you can take upon you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand the evil day having done all that ye may be able to stand 14I promise that the blessings of effective preparation and spiritual protection will flow into your life as you are watchful unto prayer vigilantly and continually I testify that pressing forward on the covenant path provides spiritual safety and invites enduring joy into our lives And I witness that the risen and living Savior will sustain and strengthen us in times both good and bad Of these truths I testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
The programs and activities of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints are becoming ever more home centered and Church supported as evidenced by the series of adjustments announced in recent general conferences President Russell M Nelson has counseled us There is much more to come Eat your vitamin pills Get your rest It s going to be exciting 1I pray for and invite the help of the Holy Ghost as we consider together several basic implications of these ongoing adjustments in the Lord s restored Church Home Centered and Church Supported Gospel LearningElder Craig C Christensen and I were companions recently in a priesthood leadership conference and he used two simple questions to emphasize the principle of becoming home centered and Church supported He suggested that instead of returning to our homes after Church meetings on Sunday and asking What did you learn about the Savior and His gospel today at church we should ask in our Church meetings What did you learn about the Savior and His gospel this week in your home Proper Sabbath day observance the new curriculum and the adjusted meeting schedule all help us to learn the gospel both in our homes and at church Each member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has an individual responsibility to learn and live the Lord s teachings and to receive by proper authority the ordinances of salvation and exaltation We should not expect the Church as an organization to teach or tell us everything we need to know and do to become devoted disciples and endure valiantly to the end 2 Rather our personal responsibility is to learn what we should learn to live as we know we should live and to become who the Master would have us become And our homes are the ultimate setting for learning living and becoming As a child Joseph Smith learned of God from his family His efforts to discover God s will for him caused Joseph to search for the truth among many different Christian denominations ponder diligently the scriptures and pray sincerely to God As young Joseph Smith returned to his home from the Sacred Grove immediately after the appearance of the Father and the Son he spoke first with his mother As he leaned up to the fireplace his mother inquired what the matter was Joseph replied Never mind all is well I am well enough off He then said to his mother I have learned for myself 3 Joseph s experience provides a powerful pattern of learning that each of us should emulate We too need to learn for ourselves The overarching purpose of Heavenly Father s plan is for His children to become more like Him Accordingly He provides us with essential opportunities to grow and progress Our commitment to learn and live according to truth is increasingly important in a world that is in commotion 4 and is ever more confused and wicked We cannot expect simply to attend Church meetings and participate in programs and thereby receive all of the spiritual edification and protection that will enable us to withstand in the evil day 5 Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness 6 Inspired Church leaders teachers and activities help individual and family efforts to grow spiritually And though we all need help pressing forward on the covenant path the ultimate responsibility for developing spiritual strength and stamina rests upon each one of us Recall how Nephi son of the prophet Lehi desired to see hear and know for himself by the power of the Holy Ghost the things his father had learned in the vision of the tree of life Nephi clearly needed and was blessed in his youth by the example and teachings of his goodly parents 7 Yet just like Joseph Smith he yearned to learn and know for himself If all you or I know about Jesus Christ and His restored gospel is what other people teach or tell us then the foundation of our testimony of Him and His glorious latter day work is built upon sand 8 We cannot rely exclusively upon or borrow gospel light and knowledge from other people even those whom we love and trust Significantly the Prophet Joseph Smith taught that each Latter day Saint needs to understand for himself or herself the designs and purposes of God in our coming into the world 9 Could we read and comprehend all that has been written from the days of Adam on the relation of man to God and angels in a future state we should know very little about it Reading the experience of others or the revelation given to them can never give us a comprehensive view of our condition and true relation to God Knowledge of these things can only be obtained by experience through the ordinances of God set forth for that purpose 10Enabling the accomplishment of this grand spiritual objective for individuals and families is one of the fundamental reasons the programs and activities of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints are becoming more home centered and Church supported in this specific season of the dispensation of the fulness of times Implications of Home Centered and Church Supported LearningLet me summarize a few basic implications of gospel learning becoming increasingly home centered and Church supported The ultimate missionary training center is in our homes secondary missionary training centers are located in Provo Manila Mexico City and in other locations Our most instructive Sunday School classes should be our individual and family study in our places of residence helpful but secondary Sunday School classes are held in our meetinghouses Family history centers now are in our homes Supplemental support for our family history research work also is available in our meetinghouses Vital temple preparation classes occur in our homes important but secondary temple preparation classes also may be conducted periodically in our meetinghouses Making our homes sanctuaries wherein we can stand in holy places 11 is essential in these latter days And as important as home centered and Church supported learning is for our spiritual strength and protection today it will be even more vital in the future Home Centered and Church Supported Learning and Temple PreparationPlease consider how the principle of home centered and Church supported applies to our individual preparation and worthiness to receive sacred ordinances and covenants in the house of the Lord Indeed temple preparation is most effective in our homes But many Church members are unsure about what appropriately can and cannot be said regarding the temple experience outside of the temple President Ezra Taft Benson described why this uncertainty exists The temple is a sacred place and the ordinances in the temple are of a sacred character Because of its sacredness we are sometimes reluctant to say anything about the temple to our children and grandchildren As a consequence many do not develop a real desire to go to the temple or when they go there they do so without much background to prepare them for the obligations and covenants they enter into I believe a proper understanding or background will immeasurably help prepare our youth for the temple and will foster within them a desire to seek their priesthood blessings just as Abraham sought his 12Two basic guidelines can help us achieve the proper understanding emphasized by President Benson Guideline 1 Because we love the Lord we always should speak about His holy house with reverence We should not disclose or describe the special symbols associated with the covenants we receive in sacred temple ceremonies Neither should we discuss the holy information that we specifically promise in the temple not to reveal Guideline 2 The temple is the house of the Lord Everything in the temple points us to our Savior Jesus Christ We may discuss the basic purposes of and the doctrine and principles associated with temple ordinances and covenants President Howard W Hunter counseled Let us share with our children the spiritual feelings we have in the temple And let us teach them more earnestly and more comfortably the things we can appropriately say about the purposes of the house of the Lord 13Across the generations from the Prophet Joseph Smith to President Russell M Nelson the doctrinal purposes of temple ordinances and covenants have been taught extensively by Church leaders 14 A rich reservoir of resources exists in print audio video and other formats to help us learn about initiatory ordinances endowments marriages and other sealing ordinances 15 Information also is available about following the Savior by receiving and honoring covenants to keep the law of obedience the law of sacrifice the law of the gospel the law of chastity and the law of consecration 16 All Church members should become familiar with the excellent materials available at temples ChurchofJesusChrist org President Russell M Nelson emphasized the vital balance between the sacred nature of temple ceremonies and the valuable information about temples published by the Church that is accurate appropriate and available publicly He explained I recommend that members read entries in the Bible Dictionary that are related to the temple such as Anoint Covenant Sacrifices and Temple One may also wish to read Exodus chapters 26 29 and Leviticus chapter 8 The Old Testament as well as the books of Moses and Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price underscores the antiquity of temple work and the enduring nature of its ordinances 17So imagine that your son or daughter asks Someone at school told me that strange clothing is worn in the temple Is that right A short video is available on temples ChurchofJesusChrist org entitled Sacred Temple Clothing This excellent resource explains how from ancient times men and women have embraced sacred music different forms of prayer symbolic religious clothing gestures and rituals to express their innermost feelings of devotion to God Thus the Church supports home centered preparation for the glorious blessings of the temple through basic instruction and remarkable resources such as this video Much useful information is available to you 18As we strive to walk in the meekness of the Lord s Spirit 19 we will be blessed to understand and achieve in our homes the necessary balance between what is and what is not appropriate to discuss about sacred temple ordinances and covenants Promise and TestimonyI suspect that some of you may be wondering if your gospel learning actually can become home centered and Church supported Perhaps you are the only member of the Church in your home or have an unsupportive spouse or are a single parent or live alone as a single or divorced Latter day Saint and you may have questions about how these principles apply to you You may be a husband and a wife looking at each other and questioning Can we do this Yes you can do this I promise that enabling blessings will flow into and be evident in your life Doors will open The light will shine Your capacity will be increased to persevere diligently and patiently I joyfully witness that compensating blessings will come as we strive to fulfill our individual responsibility to learn and love the restored gospel of Jesus Christ We truly can be prepared to obtain every needful thing 20 I so promise and testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
A rope is an essential tool with which all of us are familiar Ropes are made from strands of fabric plants wire or other materials that are each individually twisted or braided together Interestingly substances that may be quite unexceptional can be woven together and become exceptionally strong Thus effectively connecting and binding ordinary materials can produce an extraordinary tool Just as a rope obtains its strength from many intertwined individual strands so the gospel of Jesus Christ provides the greatest perspective of truth and offers the richest blessings as we heed the admonition of Paul to gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him 1 Importantly this vital gathering of truth is centered in and focused upon the Lord Jesus Christ because He is the way the truth and the life 2I pray that the Holy Ghost will enlighten each of us as we consider how the principle of gathering together in one all things in Christ applies in practical ways to learning and living His restored gospel in our daily lives A Revelatory SeasonWe live in a remarkable and revelatory season of the restored Church of Jesus Christ The historic adjustments announced today have only one overarching purpose to strengthen faith in Heavenly Father and His plan and in His Son Jesus Christ and His Atonement The Sunday meeting schedule was not simply shortened Rather we now have increased opportunities and responsibilities as individuals and families to use our time for enhancing the Sabbath as a delight at home and at church Last April the organizational structure of priesthood quorums was not merely changed Rather emphasis and strength were given to a higher and holier way of ministering to our brothers and sisters Much like the braided strands of a rope produce a powerful and durable tool all of these interrelated actions are part of a unified effort to better align the focus resources and work of the Savior s restored Church with its fundamental mission to assist God in His work to bring to pass the salvation and exaltation of His children Please do not focus primarily upon the logistical aspects of what has been announced We must not allow procedural details to obscure the overarching spiritual reasons these changes now are being made Our desire is that faith in the Father s plan and in the Savior s redeeming mission might increase in the earth and that God s everlasting covenant might be established 3 Our only objectives are to facilitate continuing conversion to the Lord and to love more completely and serve more effectively our brothers and sisters Segmenting and SeparatingSometimes as members of the Church we segment separate and apply the gospel in our lives by creating lengthy checklists of individual topics to study and tasks to accomplish But such an approach potentially can constrain our understanding and vision We must be careful because pharisaical focus upon checklists can divert us from drawing closer to the Lord The purpose and purification the happiness and joy and the continuing conversion and protection that come from yielding our hearts unto God 4 and receiving his image in our countenances 5 cannot be obtained merely by performing and checking off all the spiritual things we are supposed to do Rather the power of the Savior s gospel to transform and bless us flows from discerning and applying the interrelatedness of its doctrine principles and practices Only as we gather together in one all things in Christ with firm focus upon Him can gospel truths synergistically enable us to become what God desires us to become6 and endure valiantly to the end 7Learning and Linking Gospel TruthsThe gospel of Jesus Christ is a magnificent tapestry of truth fitly framed 8 and woven together As we learn and link together revealed gospel truths we are blessed to receive precious perspective and increased spiritual capacity through eyes that can see the Lord s influence in our lives and ears that can hear His voice 9 And the principle of gathering together in one even in Him can assist us in changing the traditional checklists into a unified integrated and complete whole Let me provide both a doctrinal and a Church example of what I am suggesting Example 1 The fourth article of faith is one of the greatest illustrations of gathering together in one all things in Christ We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are first Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ second Repentance third Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins fourth Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost 10True faith is focused in and on the Lord Jesus Christ in Him as the divine and Only Begotten Son of the Father and on Him and the redemptive mission He fulfilled For he hath answered the ends of the law and he claimeth all those who have faith in him and they who have faith in him will cleave unto every good thing wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men 11 Exercising faith in Christ is trusting and placing our confidence in Him as our Savior on His name and in His promises The first and natural consequence of trusting in the Savior is repenting and turning away from evil As we exercise faith in and on the Lord we naturally turn toward come unto and depend upon Him Thus repentance is trusting in and relying upon the Redeemer to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves Each of us must rely wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save 12 because only through the merits and mercy and grace of the Holy Messiah 13 can we become new creatures in Christ14 and ultimately return to and dwell in the presence of God The ordinance of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins requires us to trust in Him rely upon Him and follow Him Nephi proclaimed I know that if ye shall follow the Son with full purpose of heart acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God but with real intent repenting of your sins witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ by baptism yea by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water according to his word behold then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost yea then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost 15The ordinance of laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost requires us to trust in Him rely upon Him follow Him and press forward in Him with the assistance of His Holy Spirit As Nephi declared And now I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end in following the example of the Son of the living God he cannot be saved 16The fourth article of faith does not simply identify the fundamental principles and ordinances of the restored gospel Rather this inspired statement of beliefs gathers together in one all things in Christ trusting in and on Him relying upon Him following Him and pressing forward with Him even in Him Example 2 I now want to describe how all Church programs and initiatives are gathered together in one in Christ Many additional illustrations could be presented I will use only a selected few In 1978 President Spencer W Kimball instructed members of the Church to build up the strength of Zion throughout the world He counseled the Saints to remain in their native lands and establish strong stakes by gathering the family of God and teaching them the ways of the Lord He further indicated that more temples would be built and promised blessings for the Saints wherever they lived in the world 17As the number of stakes increased the need was intensified for member homes to become places where family members loved to be where they could enrich their lives and find mutual love support appreciation and encouragement 18 Consequently in 1980 Sunday meetings were consolidated into a three hour block to reemphasize personal and family responsibility for learning living and teaching the gospel 19 This emphasis on family and the home again was affirmed in The Family A Proclamation to the World introduced by President Gordon B Hinckley in 1995 20In April of 1998 President Hinckley announced the construction of many more small temples thereby bringing the sacred ordinances of the Lord s house closer to Latter day Saint individuals and families throughout the world 21 And these enhanced opportunities for spiritual growth and development were complemented by related increases in temporal self reliance through the introduction of the Perpetual Education Fund in 2001 22During his administration President Thomas S Monson repeatedly exhorted the Saints to go to the rescue and emphasized caring for the poor and needy as one of the Church s divinely appointed responsibilities Continuing the emphasis on temporal preparation the Self Reliance Services initiative was implemented in 2012 Over the past several years essential principles about making the Sabbath day a delight in the home and at church have been emphasized and reinforced 23 thus preparing us for the Sunday meeting schedule adjustment that was announced in this session of general conference And six months ago Melchizedek Priesthood quorums were strengthened and aligned more effectively with the auxiliaries to accomplish a higher and holier approach to ministering I believe that the sequence and timing of these actions over many decades can help us to see one united and comprehensive work and not just a series of independent and discrete initiatives God has revealed a pattern of spiritual progress for individuals and families through ordinances teaching programs and activities that are home centered and Church supported Church organizations and programs exist to bless individuals and families and are not ends in themselves 24I pray we can recognize the Lord s work as one great worldwide work that is becoming ever more home centered and Church supported I know and testify that the Lord is revealing and will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God 25Promise and TestimonyI began my message by highlighting the strength that is created as individual strands of material are twisted or braided together into a rope In a similar way I promise that increased perspective purpose and power will be evident in our learning and living of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as we strive to gather together in one all things in Christ even in Him All opportunities and blessings of eternal consequence originate in are possible and have purpose because of and endure through the Lord Jesus Christ As Alma testified There is no other way or means whereby man can be saved only in and through Christ Behold he is the life and the light of the world 26I joyfully declare my witness of the divinity and living reality of the Eternal Father and of His Beloved Son Jesus Christ In our Savior we find joy And in Him we find the assurance of peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come 27 I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
I rejoice in the sacred opportunity to sustain our Church leaders and I wholeheartedly welcome Elder Gong and Elder Soares to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The ministries of these faithful men will bless individuals and families all over the world and I am eager to serve with and learn from them I pray the Holy Ghost will teach and enlighten us as we learn together about a vital aspect of the Savior s divine nature1 that each of us should strive to emulate I will present several examples that highlight this Christlike quality before identifying the specific attribute later in my message Please listen carefully to each example and consider with me possible answers to the questions I will pose Example 1 The Rich Young Man and AmulekIn the New Testament we learn about a rich young man who asked Jesus Good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life 2 The Savior first admonished him to keep the commandments The Master next gave the young man an additional requirement customized to his specific needs and circumstances Jesus said unto him If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me But when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions 3Compare the response of the rich young man with the experience of Amulek as described in the Book of Mormon Amulek was an industrious and prosperous man with many kindreds and friends 4 He described himself as a man who was called many times but would not hear a man who knew the things of God but would not know 5 A basically good man Amulek was distracted by worldly concerns much like the rich young man described in the New Testament Even though he had previously hardened his heart Amulek obeyed the voice of an angel received the prophet Alma in his home and provided nourishment to him He was spiritually awakened during Alma s visit and was called to preach the gospel Amulek then forsook all his gold and silver and his precious things for the word of God and was rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred 6What do you think explains the difference between the responses of the rich young man and Amulek Example 2 PahoranDuring a perilous period of war described in the Book of Mormon an exchange of epistles occurred between Moroni the captain of the Nephite armies and Pahoran the chief judge and governor of the land Moroni whose army was suffering because of inadequate support from the government wrote to Pahoran by the way of condemnation 7 and accused him and his fellow leaders of thoughtlessness slothfulness neglect and even being traitors 8Pahoran easily might have resented Moroni and his inaccurate allegations but he did not He responded compassionately and described a rebellion against the government about which Moroni was not aware And then Pahoran declared Behold I say unto you Moroni that I do not joy in your great afflictions yea it grieves my soul In your epistle you have censured me but it mattereth not I am not angry but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart 9What do you think explains Pahoran s measured reply to Moroni s accusations Example 3 President Russell M Nelson and President Henry B EyringIn general conference six months ago President Russell M Nelson described his response to President Thomas S Monson s invitation to study ponder and apply the truths contained in the Book of Mormon He said I have tried to follow his counsel Among other things I ve made lists of what the Book of Mormon is what it affirms what it refutes what it fulfills what it clarifies and what it reveals Looking at the Book of Mormon through these lenses has been an insightful and inspiring exercise I recommend it to each of you 10President Henry B Eyring likewise emphasized the importance in his life of President Monson s request He observed I have read the Book of Mormon every day for more than 50 years So perhaps I could have reasonably thought that President Monson s words were for someone else Yet like many of you I felt the prophet s encouragement and his promise invite me to make a greater effort The happy result for me and for many of you has been what the prophet promised 11What do you think explains the immediate and heartfelt responses to President Monson s invitation by these two leaders of the Lord s Church I am not suggesting that the spiritually strong responses of Amulek Pahoran President Nelson and President Eyring are explained by only one Christlike quality Certainly many interrelated attributes and experiences led to the spiritual maturity reflected in the lives of these four noble servants But the Savior and His prophets have highlighted an essential quality that all of us need to more fully understand and strive to incorporate into our lives MeeknessPlease notice the characteristic the Lord used to describe Himself in the following scripture Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls 12Instructively the Savior chose to emphasize meekness from among all the attributes and virtues He potentially could have selected A similar pattern is evident in a revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829 The Lord declared Learn of me and listen to my words walk in the meekness of my Spirit and you shall have peace in me 13Meekness is a defining attribute of the Redeemer and is distinguished by righteous responsiveness willing submissiveness and strong self restraint This quality helps us to understand more completely the respective reactions of Amulek Pahoran President Nelson and President Eyring For example President Nelson and President Eyring righteously and rapidly responded to President Monson s encouragement to read and study the Book of Mormon Though both men were serving in important and visible Church positions and had studied the scriptures extensively for decades they demonstrated in their responses no hesitation or sense of self importance Amulek willingly submitted to God s will accepted a call to preach the gospel and left behind his comfortable circumstances and familiar relationships And Pahoran was blessed with perspective and strong self restraint to act rather than react as he explained to Moroni the challenges arising from a rebellion against the government The Christlike quality of meekness often is misunderstood in our contemporary world Meekness is strong not weak active not passive courageous not timid restrained not excessive modest not self aggrandizing and gracious not brash A meek person is not easily provoked pretentious or overbearing and readily acknowledges the accomplishments of others Whereas humility generally denotes dependence upon God and the constant need for His guidance and support a distinguishing characteristic of meekness is a particular spiritual receptivity to learning both from the Holy Ghost and from people who may seem less capable experienced or educated who may not hold important positions or who otherwise may not appear to have much to contribute Recall how Naaman captain of the king s army in Syria overcame his pride and meekly accepted the advice of his servants to obey Elisha the prophet and wash in the river Jordan seven times 14 Meekness is the principal protection from the prideful blindness that often arises from prominence position power wealth and adulation Meekness a Christlike Attribute and a Spiritual GiftMeekness is an attribute developed through desire the righteous exercise of moral agency and striving always to retain a remission of our sins 15 It also is a spiritual gift for which we appropriately can seek 16 We should remember however the purposes for which such a blessing is given even to benefit and serve the children of God 17As we come unto and follow the Savior we increasingly and incrementally are enabled to become more like Him We are empowered by the Spirit with disciplined self restraint and a settled and calm demeanor Thus meek is what we become as disciples of the Master and not just something we do Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds 18 Yet he was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth 19 His knowledge and competence could have caused him to be prideful Instead the attribute and spiritual gift of meekness with which he was blessed attenuated arrogance in his life and magnified Moses as an instrument to accomplish God s purposes The Master as an Example of MeeknessThe most majestic and meaningful examples of meekness are found in the life of the Savior Himself The Great Redeemer who descended below all things 20 and suffered bled and died to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 21 tenderly washed the dusty feet of His disciples 22 Such meekness is a hallmark characteristic of the Lord as a servant and leader Jesus provides the ultimate example of righteous responsiveness and willing submission as He suffered intense agony in Gethsemane And when he was at the place he said unto His disciples Pray that ye enter not into temptation And he kneeled down and prayed Saying Father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done 23The Savior s meekness in this eternally essential and excruciating experience demonstrates for each of us the importance of putting the wisdom of God above our own wisdom The consistency of the Lord s willing submission and strong self restraint is both awe inspiring and instructive for us all As an armed company of temple guardsmen and Roman soldiers arrived at Gethsemane to seize and arrest Jesus Peter drew his sword and cut off the right ear of the high priest s servant 24 The Savior then touched the servant s ear and healed him 25 Please note that He reached out and blessed His potential captor using the same heavenly power that could have prevented Him from being captured and crucified Consider also how the Master was accused and condemned before Pilate to be crucified 26 Jesus had declared during His betrayal Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels 27 Yet the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead 28 paradoxically was judged before a temporary political appointee And Jesus answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly 29 The Savior s meekness is evidenced in His disciplined response strong restraint and unwillingness to exert His infinite power for personal benefit Promise and TestimonyMormon identifies meekness as the foundation from which all spiritual capacities and gifts arise Wherefore if a man have faith he must needs have hope for without faith there cannot be any hope And again behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope save he shall be meek and lowly of heart If so his faith and hope is vain for none is acceptable before God save the meek and lowly in heart and if a man be meek and lowly in heart and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ he must needs have charity for if he have not charity he is nothing wherefore he must needs have charity 30The Savior declared Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth 31 Meekness is an essential aspect of the divine nature and can be received and developed in our lives because of and through the Savior s Atonement I testify that Jesus Christ is our resurrected and living Redeemer And I promise that He will guide protect and strengthen us as we walk in the meekness of His Spirit I declare my sure witness of these truths and promises in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
One of the great challenges each of us faces every day is to not allow the concerns of this world to so dominate our time and energy that we neglect the eternal things that matter most 1 We can be too easily diverted from remembering and focusing upon essential spiritual priorities because of our many responsibilities and busy schedules Sometimes we try to run so fast that we may forget where we are going and why we are running The Apostle Peter reminds us that for disciples of Jesus Christ his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust 2My message emphasizes the importance of the exceeding great and precious promises described by Peter as true reminders of where we are going in our mortal journey and why I also will discuss the respective roles of the Sabbath day the holy temple and our homes in helping us to remember these important spiritual promises I earnestly pray that the Holy Ghost will instruct each of us as we consider together these important truths Our Divine IdentityOur Heavenly Father s great plan of happiness includes the doctrine the ordinances the covenants and the exceeding great and precious promises whereby we can become partakers of the divine nature His plan defines our eternal identity and the pathway we must follow to learn change grow and ultimately dwell with Him forever As explained in The Family A Proclamation to the World All human beings male and female are created in the image of God Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents and as such each has a divine nature and destiny In the premortal realm spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life 3God promises His children that if they follow the precepts of His plan and the example of His Beloved Son keep the commandments and endure in faith to the end then by virtue of the Savior s Redemption they shall have eternal life which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God 4 Eternal life is the ultimate exceeding great and precious promise Spiritual RebirthWe comprehend more fully the exceeding great and precious promises and begin to partake of the divine nature by responding affirmatively to the call from the Lord to glory and virtue As described by Peter this call is fulfilled by striving to escape the corruption that is in the world As we press forward submissively with faith in the Savior then because of His Atonement and by the power of the Holy Ghost a mighty change takes place in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually 5 We are born again yea born of God changed from our carnal and fallen state to a state of righteousness being redeemed of God 6 Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new 7Such a comprehensive change in our nature typically does not occur quickly or all at once Like the Savior we also receive not of the fulness at the first but receive grace for grace 8 For behold thus saith the Lord God I will give unto the children of men line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts and lend an ear unto my counsel for they shall learn wisdom 9Priesthood ordinances and sacred covenants are essential in this ongoing process of spiritual rebirth they also are the means God has appointed whereby we receive His exceeding great and precious promises Ordinances that are received worthily and remembered continually open the heavenly channels through which the power of godliness can flow into our lives Covenants that are honored steadfastly and remembered always provide purpose and the assurance of blessings in both mortality and for eternity For example God promises us according to our faithfulness the constant companionship of the third member of the Godhead even the Holy Ghost 10 that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can receive and always retain a remission of our sins 11 that we can receive peace in this world 12 that the Savior has broken the bands of death and was victorious over the grave 13 and that families can be together for all eternity Understandably all of the exceeding great and precious promises Heavenly Father offers to His children cannot be counted or described comprehensively However even the partial list of promised blessings I just presented should cause each of us to stand all amazed 14 and fall down and worship the Father 15 in the name of Jesus Christ Remembering the PromisesPresident Lorenzo Snow warned We are too apt to forget the great object of life the motive of our Heavenly Father in sending us here to put on mortality as well as the holy calling with which we have been called and hence instead of rising above the little transitory things we too often allow ourselves to come down to the level of the world without availing ourselves of the divine help which God has instituted which alone can enable us to overcome those transitory things 16The Sabbath day and the holy temple are two specific sources of divine help instituted by God to assist us in rising above the level and corruption of the world We initially may think that the overarching purposes of keeping the Sabbath day holy and attending the temple are related but distinctive I believe however that those two purposes are precisely the same and work together to strengthen us spiritually as individuals and in our homes The SabbathAfter God created all things He rested on the seventh day and commanded that one day each week be a time of rest to help people remember Him 17 The Sabbath is God s time a sacred time specifically set apart for worshipping Him and for receiving and remembering His great and precious promises The Lord has directed in this dispensation That thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High 18Thus on the Sabbath we worship the Father in the name of the Son by participating in ordinances and learning about receiving remembering and renewing covenants On His holy day our thoughts actions and demeanor are signs we give to God and an indicator of our love for Him 19An additional purpose of the Sabbath is to elevate our vision from the things of the world to the blessings of eternity Removed during this sacred time from many of the regular routines of our busy lives we can look to God and live 20 by receiving and remembering the great and precious promises whereby we become partakers of the divine nature The Holy TempleThe Lord always has commanded His people to build temples holy places in which worthy Saints perform sacred gospel ceremonies and ordinances for themselves and for the dead Temples are the most holy of all places of worship A temple literally is the house of the Lord a sacred space specifically set apart for worshipping God and for receiving and remembering His great and precious promises The Lord has directed in this dispensation Organize yourselves prepare every needful thing and establish a house even a house of prayer a house of fasting a house of faith a house of learning a house of glory a house of order a house of God 21 The principal focus of temple worship is participating in ordinances and learning about receiving and remembering covenants We think act and dress differently in the temple than in other spaces that we may frequent A principal purpose of the temple is to elevate our vision from the things of the world to the blessings of eternity Removed for a short time from the worldly settings with which we are familiar we can look to God and live 22 by receiving and remembering the great and precious promises whereby we become partakers of the divine nature Please note that the Sabbath day and the temple respectively are a sacred time and a sacred space specifically set apart for worshipping God and for receiving and remembering His exceeding great and precious promises to His children As instituted by God the principal purposes of these two divine sources of help are exactly the same to powerfully and repeatedly focus our attention upon our Heavenly Father His Only Begotten Son the Holy Ghost and the promises associated with the ordinances and covenants of the Savior s restored gospel Our HomesImportantly a home should be the ultimate combination of time and space wherein individuals and families remember most effectively God s great and precious promises Leaving our homes to spend time in Sunday meetings and to enter the sacred space of a temple is vital but insufficient Only as we bring the spirit and strength derived from those holy activities back with us into our homes can we sustain our focus upon the great purposes of mortal life and overcome the corruption that is in the world Our Sabbath and temple experiences should be spiritual catalysts that imbue individuals and families and our homes with continual reminders of key lessons learned with the presence and power of the Holy Ghost with ongoing and deepening conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ and with a perfect brightness of hope 23 in God s eternal promises The Sabbath and the temple can help us to establish in our homes a more excellent way 24 as we gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him 25 What we do in our homes with His sacred time and with what we learn in His sacred space is pivotal to becoming partakers of the divine nature Promise and TestimonyWe easily can be overcome by the routine and mundane matters of mortality Sleeping eating dressing working playing exercising and many other customary activities are necessary and important But ultimately what we become is the result of our knowledge of and willingness to learn from the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost it is not merely the sum total of our daily pursuits over the course of a lifetime The gospel is so much more than a routine checklist of discrete tasks to be performed rather it is a magnificent tapestry of truth fitly framed 26 and woven together designed to help us become like our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ even partakers of the divine nature Truly we are blinded by looking beyond the mark 27 when this overarching spiritual reality is overshadowed by the cares concerns and casualness of the world As we are wise and invite the Holy Spirit to be our guide 28 I promise He will teach us what is true He will testify of Christ and light our minds with heaven s view 29 as we strive to fulfill our eternal destiny and become partakers of the divine nature I bear my witness that the exceeding great and precious promises associated with our ordinances and covenants are sure The Lord has so declared I give unto you directions how you may act before me that it may turn to you for your salvation I the Lord am bound when ye do what I say but when ye do not what I say ye have no promise 30I witness that our Heavenly Father lives and is the author of the plan of salvation Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten Son our Savior and Redeemer He lives And I testify that the Father s plan and promises the Savior s Atonement and the companionship of the Holy Ghost make possible peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come 31 Of these things I testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
President Monson we are thrilled to hear your voice and to receive your instruction We love you we sustain you and we ever pray for you I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we consider together principles pertaining to the great work of preaching the gospel to every nation kindred tongue and people 1Called to Serve and Assigned to LaborEvery year tens of thousands of young men and young women and many senior couples eagerly anticipate receiving a special letter from Salt Lake City The content of the letter affects forever the person to whom it is addressed as well as family members and a great number of other people Upon arrival the envelope may be opened neatly and patiently or ripped apart excitedly and with great haste Reading this special letter is an experience never to be forgotten The letter is signed by the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and the first two sentences read as follows You are hereby called to serve as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints You are assigned to labor in the Mission Please note that the first sentence is a call to serve as a full time missionary in the Lord s restored Church The second sentence indicates an assignment to labor in a specific place and mission The important distinction expressed in these two sentences is essential for all of us to understand In the culture of the Church we often talk of being called to serve in a country such as Argentina Poland Korea or the United States But a missionary is not called to a place rather he or she is called to serve As the Lord declared through the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829 If ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work 2Each mission call and assignment or a later reassignment is the result of revelation through the Lord s servants A call to the work comes from God through the President of the Church An assignment to one of the more than 400 missions presently operating around the world comes from God through a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles acting with the authorization of the Lord s living prophet The spiritual gifts of prophecy and revelation attend all mission calls and assignments Section 80 of the Doctrine and Covenants is a record of a mission call to Stephen Burnett extended by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1832 Studying this call to Brother Burnett can help us to 1 understand more clearly the distinction between being called to the work as a missionary and assigned to labor in a particular place and 2 appreciate more completely our individual and divinely appointed responsibility to proclaim the gospel Verse 1 of this section is a call to serve Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett Go ye go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice 3Interestingly verse 2 informs Brother Burnett about his assigned missionary companion And inasmuch as you desire a companion I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith 4Verse 3 indicates where these two missionaries are to labor Wherefore go ye and preach my gospel whether to the north or to the south to the east or to the west it mattereth not for ye cannot go amiss 5I do not believe that the phrase it mattereth not as used by the Lord in this scripture suggests that He does not care where His servants labor In fact He cares deeply But because the work of preaching the gospel is the Lord s work He inspires guides and directs His authorized servants As missionaries strive to be ever more worthy and capable instruments in His hands and do their best to fulfill faithfully their duties then with His help they cannot go amiss wherever they serve Perhaps one of the lessons the Savior is teaching us in this revelation is that an assignment to labor in a specific place is essential and important but secondary to a call to the work The next verse highlights important qualifications for all missionaries Therefore declare the things which ye have heard and verily believe and know to be true 6The final verse reminds Brother Burnett and all of us from whom a call to serve truly comes Behold this is the will of him who hath called you your Redeemer even Jesus Christ Amen 7Overcoming MisunderstandingSome of you may be asking yourselves why I have chosen to discuss in a priesthood session of general conference this seemingly obvious distinction between being called to the work and assigned to labor My answer to this question is quite straightforward my experience has taught me that these principles are not well understood by many members of the Church The single greatest reason for addressing this matter is what I have learned over time about the concern the worry and even the guilt felt by many missionaries who for various reasons were reassigned to a different field of labor during their time of service Such reassignments sometimes are necessary because of events and circumstances such as physical accidents and injuries delays and challenges in obtaining visas political instability creating and staffing new missions or the evolving and ever changing needs around the world in the work of proclaiming the gospel 8When a missionary is reassigned to a different field of labor the process is precisely the same as for the initial assignment Members of the Quorum of the Twelve seek inspiration and guidance in making all such reassignments I recently spoke with a faithful man who shared with me the deepest feelings of his heart In a meeting I had just explained the difference between being called to the work and assigned to labor This good brother shook my hand and with tears in his eyes said to me The things you helped me learn today have lifted a burden from my shoulders that I have carried for more than 30 years As a young missionary I was initially assigned to a field of labor in South America But I was unable to obtain a visa so my assignment was changed to the United States All these years I have wondered why I was unable to serve in the place to which I had been called Now I know I was called to the work and not to a place I cannot tell you how much this understanding has helped me My heart ached for this good man As I have taught these basic principles throughout the world countless individuals have expressed privately to me the same sentiment as the man I just described I am addressing this subject today because not a single member of this Church should carry an unnecessary burden of misunderstanding uncertainty anguish or guilt about an assignment to labor Wherefore go ye and preach my gospel whether to the north or to the south to the east or to the west it mattereth not for ye cannot go amiss 9 As you ponder the words of this scripture and open your heart I hope and pray you will invite the Holy Ghost to carry deep into your soul the understanding the healing and the restoring you may need One additional reason I have felt impressed to discuss this topic is my personal experience assigning missionaries over many years For the Twelve nothing affirms the reality of ongoing latter day revelation more powerfully than seeking to discern the Lord s will as we fulfill our responsibility to assign missionaries to their respective fields of labor I witness that the Savior knows and is mindful of each of us one by one and name by name Preparing for a Call to the WorkI now want to discuss briefly a fundamental but frequently overlooked aspect of preparing for a call to the work Three interrelated words define a pattern of preparation and progression for sons of God priesthood temple mission Sometimes as parents friends and Church members we focus so extensively upon missionary preparation for young men that we may neglect to a degree the other vital steps along the covenant pathway that must be fulfilled before beginning full time missionary service Working as a missionary certainly is one but not the only important building block in the process of creating a strong foundation for a lifetime of spiritual growth and service Priesthood and temple blessings both of which precede arriving in an assigned field of labor also are necessary to fortify and strengthen us spiritually throughout our entire lives Young men as you fulfill your duties in and honor the Aaronic Priesthood or lesser priesthood you are preparing to receive and magnify the oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood or higher priesthood 10 Personal worthiness is the single most important requirement for receiving the higher priesthood A lifetime of selfless priesthood service lies before you Prepare now by frequently rendering meaningful service Please learn to love being and remaining worthy Be worthy Stay worthy After receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood and a call to serve a young man can be armed with power11 through the covenants and ordinances of the holy temple Going to the temple and having the spirit of the temple go through you precedes effective service as a full time missionary Personal worthiness is the single most important requirement for receiving the blessings of the temple for you young men and for all members of the Church As you live in accordance with gospel standards you can enter the house of the Lord and participate in sacred ordinances throughout your teenage years Your love for and understanding of temple ordinances will strengthen and bless you throughout your life Please learn to love being and remaining worthy Be worthy Stay worthy Many young men and young women already hold a current limited use temple recommend As Aaronic Priesthood holders you are finding your own family names and performing baptisms and confirmations for your family members in the temple Maintaining your temple recommend demonstrates your worthiness and serving others in the temple is an important part of preparing for the Melchizedek Priesthood Young men each of you is a missionary now All around you every day are friends and neighbors who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it 12 As you are directed by the Spirit you can share a thought an invitation a text or tweet that will introduce your friends to the truths of the restored gospel You need not and should not wait for your official call to become anxiously engaged in missionary work As priesthood temple and mission blessings are gathered together in one in Christ 13 and synergistically interact in the heart mind and soul of a young missionary he can qualify for the work 14 His capacity is increased to fulfill the responsibility to represent authoritatively the Lord Jesus Christ The spiritually potent combination of honoring priesthood and temple covenants receiving the power of godliness 15 through priesthood ordinances 16 serving selflessly and proclaiming the everlasting gospel to God s children enables a young man to become firm and steadfast in the faith 17 and rooted and built up in Christ 18In our homes and at church we should give balanced emphasis to all three elements of the Lord s pattern of preparation and progression for faithful sons of God priesthood temple mission All three require us to love being and remaining worthy Be worthy Stay worthy Promise and TestimonyMy beloved brethren I promise that the spiritual gift of revelation will attend your call to the work of proclaiming the gospel and your assignment to a specific field or fields of labor As you diligently prepare now through selfless priesthood and temple service your witness of the Lord s living reality will be strengthened Love for Him and His work will fill your heart As you learn to love being worthy you will become a mighty instrument in the hands of the Lord to bless and serve many people Joyfully I witness that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ live To be engaged in Their service is one of the greatest blessings we can ever receive I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
As the Savior concluded the Sermon on the Mount He emphasized the eternal truth that only by doing the will of the Father is the saving grace of the Son obtainable 1He declared Not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works And then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity 2Our understanding of this episode is enlarged as we reflect upon an inspired revision to the text Significantly the Lord s phrase reported in the King James Version of the Bible I never knew you was changed in the Joseph Smith Translation to Ye never knew me 3Consider also the parable of the ten virgins Recall that the five foolish and unprepared virgins went to obtain oil for their lamps after hearing the cry to go and meet the bridegroom And while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut Afterward came also the five foolish virgins saying Lord Lord open to us But he answered and said Verily I say unto you I know you not 4The implications of this parable for each of us are expanded by another inspired revision Importantly the phrase I know you not as reported in the King James Version of the Bible was clarified in the Joseph Smith Translation to Ye know me not 5The phrases Ye never knew me and Ye know me not should be a cause of deep spiritual introspection for each of us Do we only know about the Savior or are we increasingly coming to know Him How do we come to know the Lord These questions of the soul are the focus of my message I earnestly invite the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we consider together this vital subject Coming to KnowJesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me If ye had known me ye should have known my Father also 6We come to know the Father as we come to know His Beloved Son A grand objective of mortality is not merely learning about the Only Begotten of the Father but also striving to know Him Four essential steps that can help us come to know the Lord are exercising faith in Him following Him serving Him and believing Him Exercising Faith in HimThe exercise of faith in Jesus Christ is relying upon His merits mercy and grace 7 We begin to come to know the Savior as we arouse our spiritual faculties and experiment upon His teachings even until we can give place in our souls for a portion of His words 8 As our faith in the Lord increases we trust in Him and have confidence in His power to redeem heal and strengthen us True faith is focused in and on the Lord and always leads to righteous action Faith in Christ is the first principle in revealed religion the foundation of all righteousness and the principle of action in all intelligent beings 9 Because acting in accordance with the correct principles the Redeemer proclaimed is central to receiving and exercising true faith faith without works is dead 10 We are to be doers of the word and not hearers only 11Hearing God s word and receiving the spiritual gift of faith in the Savior are closely related as faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God 12 We become acquainted with Him and His voice as we study and feast upon His word in the scriptures 13 pray to the Father in His name with real intent 14 and seek for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost 15 Learning and applying in our lives the doctrine of Christ is a prerequisite to receiving the gift of faith in Him 16Exercising faith in the Lord is a necessary preparation for following Him Following Him And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers And he saith unto them Follow me and I will make you fishers of men And they straightway left their nets and followed him 17Peter and Andrew are strong examples of hearing and following the Master The Savior likewise instructs you and me If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 18 To take up one s cross is to deny oneself of all ungodliness and every worldly lust and to keep the commandments of the Lord 19The Savior has admonished us to become as He is 20 Thus following the Lord includes emulating Him We continue to come to know the Lord as we seek through the power of His Atonement to become like Him In His mortal ministry Jesus marked the path led the way and set the perfect example A correct idea of his character perfections and attributes 21 provides enduring purpose and clear direction as we follow Him on the road of devoted discipleship Following the Savior also enables us to receive an actual knowledge that the course of life we are pursuing 22 is in accordance with God s will Such knowledge is not an unknowable mystery and is not focused primarily upon our temporal pursuits or ordinary mortal concerns Rather steady and sustained progress along the covenant pathway is the course of life that is pleasing to Him Lehi s dream in the Book of Mormon identifies the path we should follow the challenges we will encounter and the spiritual resources available to assist us in following and coming unto the Savior Pressing forward on the strait and narrow path is what He would have us do Tasting the fruit of the tree and becoming deeply converted unto the Lord 23 are the blessings He yearns for us to receive Hence He beckons us Come follow me 24Both exercising faith in and following Jesus Christ are necessary preparations for serving Him Serving Him For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart 25We more fully come to know the Lord as we serve Him and labor in His kingdom As we do so He generously blesses us with heavenly help spiritual gifts and increased capacity We are never left alone as we work in His vineyard He declared For I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 26We come to know the Savior as we do our best to go where He wants us to go as we strive to say what He wants us to say and as we become what He wants us to become 27 As we submissively acknowledge our total dependence upon Him He enlarges our capacity to serve ever more effectively Gradually our desires align more completely with His desires and His purposes become our purposes such that we would not ask that which is contrary to His will 28Serving Him requires all of our heart might mind and strength 29 Consequently selflessly serving others counteracts the self centered and selfish tendencies of the natural man We grow to love those whom we serve And because serving others is serving God we grow to love Him and our brothers and sisters more deeply Such love is a manifestation of the spiritual gift of charity even the pure love of Christ 30 Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure 31We come to know the Lord as we are filled with His love Believing HimIs it possible to exercise faith in Him follow Him serve Him but not believe Him I am acquainted with Church members who accept as true the doctrine and principles contained in the scriptures and proclaimed from this pulpit And yet they have a hard time believing those gospel truths apply specifically in their lives and to their circumstances They seem to have faith in the Savior but they do not believe His promised blessings are available to them or can operate in their lives I also encounter brothers and sisters who fulfill their callings dutifully but for whom the restored gospel has not yet become a living and transforming reality in their lives We come to know the Lord as we not only believe in Him but also believe Him and His assurances In the New Testament a father asked the Savior to heal his child Jesus answered If thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief 32I have reflected many times on this father s request Help thou mine unbelief I wonder if the intent of the man s pleading was not primarily to help him believe in Jesus as our Redeemer and in His healing power He already may have acknowledged Christ as the Son of God But perhaps he needed help to believe the Master s healing power indeed could be so individual and so personalized as to bless his own beloved son He may have believed in Christ generally but not believed Christ specifically and personally We often testify of what we know to be true but perhaps the more relevant question for each of us is whether we believe what we know Sacred ordinances performed by proper priesthood authority are essential to believing the Savior coming to know Him and ultimately believing what we know And the Melchizedek priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom even the key of the knowledge of God Therefore in the ordinances thereof the power of godliness is manifest 33We believe and come to know the Lord as the key of the knowledge of God administered through the Melchizedek Priesthood unlocks the door and makes it possible for each of us to receive the power of godliness in our lives We believe and come to know the Savior as we follow Him by receiving and faithfully honoring holy ordinances and increasingly have His image in our countenances 34 We believe and come to know Christ as we experience personally the transforming healing strengthening and sanctifying power of His Atonement We believe and come to know the Master as the power of his word takes root in us 35 and is written in our minds and hearts36 and as we give away all our sins to know Him 37Believing Him is trusting that His bounteous blessings are available and applicable in our individual lives and families Believing Him with our whole soul38 comes as we press forward along the covenant pathway surrender our will to His and submit to His priorities and timing for us Believing Him accepting as true His power and promises invites perspective peace and joy into our lives Promise and TestimonyOn a future day every knee shall bow and every tongue confess 39 that Jesus is the Christ On that blessed day we will know He knows each of us by name And I witness and promise we can not only know about the Lord but also come to know Him as we exercise faith in follow serve and believe Him I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
A profound phrase used by King Benjamin in his teachings about the Savior and His Atonement has been a recurring topic of my study and pondering for many years In his spiritually stirring farewell sermon to the people he had served and loved King Benjamin described the importance of knowing the glory of God and tasting of His love of receiving a remission of sins of always remembering the greatness of God and of praying daily and standing steadfastly in the faith 1 He also promised that by doing these things ye shall always rejoice and be filled with the love of God and always retain a remission of your sins 2My message focuses upon the principle of always retaining a remission of our sins The truth expressed in this phrase can strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and deepen our discipleship I pray the Holy Ghost will inspire and edify us as we consider together essential spiritual truths Spiritual RebirthIn mortality we experience physical birth and the opportunity for spiritual rebirth 3 We are admonished by prophets and apostles to awake unto God 4 be born again 5 and become new creatures in Christ6 by receiving in our lives the blessings made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ The merits and mercy and grace of the Holy Messiah 7 can help us triumph over the self centered and selfish tendencies of the natural man and become more selfless benevolent and saintly We are exhorted to so live that we can stand spotless before the Lord at the last day 8The Holy Ghost and Priesthood OrdinancesThe Prophet Joseph Smith summarized succinctly the essential role of priesthood ordinances in the gospel of Jesus Christ Being born again comes by the Spirit of God through ordinances 9 This penetrating statement emphasizes the roles of both the Holy Ghost and sacred ordinances in the process of spiritual rebirth The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead He is a personage of spirit and bears witness of all truth In the scriptures the Holy Ghost is referred to as the Comforter 10 a teacher 11 and a revelator 12 Additionally the Holy Ghost is a sanctifier13 who cleanses and burns dross and evil out of human souls as though by fire Holy ordinances are central in the Savior s gospel and in the process of coming unto Him and seeking spiritual rebirth Ordinances are sacred acts that have spiritual purpose eternal significance and are related to God s laws and statutes 14 All saving ordinances and the ordinance of the sacrament must be authorized by one who holds the requisite priesthood keys The ordinances of salvation and exaltation administered in the Lord s restored Church are far more than rituals or symbolic performances Rather they constitute authorized channels through which the blessings and powers of heaven can flow into our individual lives And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom even the key of the knowledge of God Therefore in the ordinances thereof the power of godliness is manifest And without the ordinances thereof and the authority of the priesthood the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh 15Ordinances received and honored with integrity are essential to obtaining the power of godliness and all of the blessings made available through the Savior s Atonement Obtaining and Retaining a Remission of Sins through OrdinancesTo comprehend more fully the process whereby we may obtain and always retain a remission of our sins we need first to understand the inseparable relationship among three sacred ordinances that provide access to the powers of heaven baptism by immersion laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and the sacrament Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins is the introductory ordinance of the gospel 16 of Jesus Christ and must be preceded by faith in the Savior and by sincere repentance This ordinance is a sign and a commandment which God has set for His children to enter into His kingdom 17 Baptism is administered in the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood In the process of coming unto the Savior and spiritual rebirth baptism provides a necessary initial cleansing of our soul from sin The baptismal covenant includes three fundamental commitments 1 to be willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ 2 to always remember Him and 3 to keep His commandments The promised blessing for honoring this covenant is that we may always have his Spirit to be with us 18 Thus baptism is the essential preparation to receive the authorized opportunity for the constant companionship of the third member of the Godhead Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit in order to be complete 19 As the Savior taught Nicodemus Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God 20Three statements by the Prophet Joseph Smith emphasize the vital linkage between the ordinances of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost Statement 1 Baptism is a holy ordinance preparatory to the reception of the Holy Ghost it is the channel and key by which the Holy Ghost will be administered 21Statement 2 You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost Baptism by water is but half a baptism and is good for nothing without the other half that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost 22Statement 3 The baptism of water without the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost attending it is of no use They are necessarily and inseparably connected 23The consistent connectedness among the principle of repentance the ordinances of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost and the glorious blessing of the remission of sins is emphasized repeatedly in the scriptures Nephi declared For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost 24The Savior Himself proclaimed Now this is the commandment Repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day 25Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost is an ordinance administered in the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood In the process of coming unto the Savior and spiritual rebirth receiving the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost in our lives creates the possibility of an ongoing cleansing of our soul from sin This joyous blessing is vital because no unclean thing can dwell with God 26As members of the Lord s restored Church we are blessed both by our initial cleansing from sin associated with baptism and by the potential for an ongoing cleansing from sin made possible through the companionship and power of the Holy Ghost even the third member of the Godhead Consider how a farmer depends upon the unchanging pattern of planting and harvesting Understanding the connection between sowing and reaping is a constant source of purpose and influences all of the decisions and actions a farmer undertakes in all seasons of the year In like manner the inseparable connection between the ordinances of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost should impact every aspect of our discipleship in all seasons of our lives The sacrament is the third ordinance necessary to obtain access to the power of godliness That we might more fully keep ourselves unspotted from the world we are commanded to go to the house of prayer and offer up our sacraments upon the Lord s holy day 27 Please consider that the emblems of the Lord s body and blood the bread and the water are both blessed and sanctified O God the Eternal Father we ask thee in the name of thy Son Jesus Christ to bless and sanctify this bread or this water to the souls of all those who partake or drink of it 28 To sanctify is to make pure and holy The sacramental emblems are sanctified in remembrance of Christ s purity of our total dependence upon His Atonement and of our responsibility to so honor our ordinances and covenants that we can stand spotless before Him at the last day 29The ordinance of the sacrament is a holy and repeated invitation to repent sincerely and to be renewed spiritually The act of partaking of the sacrament in and of itself does not remit sins But as we prepare conscientiously and participate in this holy ordinance with a broken heart and a contrite spirit then the promise is that we may always have the Spirit of the Lord to be with us And by the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost as our constant companion we can always retain a remission of our sins We truly are blessed each week by the opportunity to evaluate our lives through the ordinance of the sacrament to renew our covenants and to receive this covenant promise 30Baptized AgainSometimes Latter day Saints express the wish that they could be baptized again and thereby become as clean and worthy as the day on which they received their first saving gospel ordinance May I respectfully suggest that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son do not intend for us to experience such a feeling of spiritual renewal refreshment and restoration just once in our lives The blessings of obtaining and always retaining a remission of our sins through gospel ordinances help us understand that baptism is a point of departure in our mortal spiritual journey it is not a destination we should yearn to revisit over and over again The ordinances of baptism by immersion the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and the sacrament are not isolated and discrete events rather they are elements in an interrelated and additive pattern of redemptive progress Each successive ordinance elevates and enlarges our spiritual purpose desire and performance The Father s plan the Savior s Atonement and the ordinances of the gospel provide the grace we need to press forward and progress line upon line and precept upon precept toward our eternal destiny Promise and TestimonyWe are imperfect human beings striving to live in mortality according to Heavenly Father s perfect plan of eternal progression The requirements of His plan are glorious merciful and rigorous We may at times be filled with determination and at other times feel totally inadequate We may wonder if we spiritually can ever fulfill the commandment to stand spotless before Him at the last day With the help of the Lord and through the power of His Spirit to teach us all things 31 indeed we can be blessed to realize our spiritual possibilities Ordinances invite spiritual purpose and power into our lives as we strive to be born again and become men and women of Christ 32 Our weaknesses can be strengthened and our limitations can be overcome Although none of us can achieve perfection in this life we can become increasingly worthy and spotless as we are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb 33 I promise and testify we will be blessed with increased faith in the Savior and greater spiritual assurance as we seek to always retain a remission of our sins and ultimately to stand spotless before the Lord at the last day I so witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
In 1996 President Gordon B Hinckley appeared on the national television news program 60 Minutes Mike Wallace an experienced and tenacious journalist interviewed President Hinckley about a number of important topics Near the end of their conversation Mr Wallace remarked There are those who say This is a gerontocracy This is a church run by old men President Hinckley responded cheerfully and without hesitation Isn t it wonderful to have a man of maturity at the head a man of judgment who isn t blown about by every wind of doctrine broadcast on Apr 7 1996 My purpose is to explain why indeed it is wonderful to have older men of great spiritual maturity and judgment serving in the senior leadership positions of the restored Church of Jesus Christ and why we should hear and hearken Mosiah 2 9 to the teachings of these men whom the Lord has chosen to bear testimony of His name among all nations kindreds tongues and people D C 112 1 I pray we may all be instructed by the Holy Ghost as we consider together this significant subject A Lesson of a LifetimeI speak about this topic from a decidedly distinctive perspective For the last 11 years I have been the youngest member of the Twelve in terms of chronological age During my years of service the average age of the men serving in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has been 77 years the oldest average age of the Apostles over an 11 year interval in this dispensation I have been blessed by the collective apostolic personal and professional experience and insight of the quorum members with whom I serve An example from my association with Elder Robert D Hales highlights the remarkable opportunities I have to learn from and serve with these leaders Several years ago I spent a Sunday afternoon with Elder Hales in his home as he was recovering from a serious illness We discussed our families our quorum responsibilities and important experiences At one point I asked Elder Hales You have been a successful husband father athlete pilot business executive and Church leader What lessons have you learned as you have grown older and been constrained by decreased physical capacity Elder Hales paused for a moment and responded When you cannot do what you have always done then you only do what matters most I was struck by the simplicity and comprehensiveness of his answer My beloved apostolic associate shared with me a lesson of a lifetime a lesson learned through the crucible of physical suffering and spiritual searching Human Limitations and FrailtiesThe limitations that are the natural consequence of advancing age can in fact become remarkable sources of spiritual learning and insight The very factors many may believe limit the effectiveness of these servants can become some of their greatest strengths Physical restrictions can expand vision Limited stamina can clarify priorities Inability to do many things can direct focus to a few things of greatest importance Some people have suggested younger more vigorous leaders are needed in the Church to address effectively the serious challenges of our modern world But the Lord does not use contemporary philosophies and practices of leadership to accomplish His purposes see Isaiah 55 8 9 We can expect the President and other senior leaders of the Church will be older and spiritually seasoned men The Lord s revealed pattern of governance by councils in His Church provides for and attenuates the impact of human frailties Interestingly the mortal limitations of these men actually affirm the divine source of the revelations that come to and through them Truly these men are called of God by prophecy see Articles of Faith 1 5 A Pattern of PreparationI have observed in my Brethren at least a part of the Lord s purpose for having older men of maturity and judgment serve in senior leadership positions of the Church These men have had a sustained season of tutoring by the Lord whom they represent serve and love They have learned to understand the divine language of the Holy Spirit and the Lord s patterns for receiving revelation These ordinary men have undergone a most extraordinary developmental process that has sharpened their vision informed their insight engendered love for people from all nations and circumstances and affirmed the reality of the Restoration I have witnessed repeatedly my Brethren striving diligently to fulfill and magnify their responsibilities while struggling with serious physical problems These men are not spared from affliction Rather they are blessed and strengthened to press forward valiantly while suffering in and with affliction Serving with these representatives of the Lord I have come to know their greatest desire is to discern and do the will of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son As we counsel together inspiration has been received and decisions have been made that reflect a degree of light and truth far beyond human intelligence reasoning and experience As we work together in unity on perplexing problems our collective understanding of an issue has been enlarged in marvelous ways by the power of the Holy Ghost I am blessed to observe on a daily basis the individual personalities capacities and noble characters of these leaders Some people find the human shortcomings of the Brethren troubling and faith diminishing For me those imperfections are encouraging and faith promoting An Additional LessonI have now witnessed six of my Brethren receive a transfer through physical death to new responsibilities in the spirit world President James E Faust President Gordon B Hinckley Elder Joseph B Wirthlin Elder L Tom Perry President Boyd K Packer and Elder Richard G Scott These valiant Brethren devoted their whole souls Omni 1 26 to testifying of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world The totality of their teachings is priceless These servants shared with us in the concluding years of their mortal ministries powerful spiritual summaries of lessons learned through decades of consecrated service These leaders imparted truths of great worth at a time when some may believe they had the least to give Consider the final teachings of great prophets in the scriptures For example Nephi concluded his record with these words For thus hath the Lord commanded me and I must obey 2 Nephi 33 15 Near the end of his life Jacob admonished Repent ye and enter in at the strait gate and continue in the way which is narrow until ye shall obtain eternal life O be wise what can I say more Jacob 6 11 12 Moroni completed his work of preparing the plates with a hopeful anticipation of the Resurrection I soon go to rest in the paradise of God until my spirit and body shall again reunite and I am brought forth triumphant through the air to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead Moroni 10 34 You and I are blessed to learn from the benedictory teachings and testimonies of latter day prophets and apostles The names today are not Nephi Jacob and Moroni but President Faust President Hinckley Elder Wirthlin Elder Perry President Packer and Elder Scott I am not suggesting the final messages of these beloved men necessarily were the most noteworthy or important of their ministries However the sum of their spiritual learning and life experiences enabled these leaders to emphasize eternal truths with absolute authenticity and great penetrating power In his last general conference address in April of 2007 President Faust declared The Savior has offered to all of us a precious peace through His Atonement but this can come only as we are willing to cast out negative feelings of anger spite or revenge Let us remember that we need to forgive to be forgiven With all my heart and soul I believe in the healing power that can come to us as we follow the counsel of the Savior to forgive all men D C 64 10 The Healing Power of Forgiveness Ensign or Liahona May 2007 69 President Faust s message is a powerful lesson of a lifetime from a man I love and one of the most forgiving men I have ever known President Hinckley testified in his last general conference in October of 2007 I affirm my witness of the calling of the Prophet Joseph of his works of the sealing of his testimony with his blood as a martyr to the eternal truth You and I are faced with the stark question of accepting the truth of the First Vision and that which followed it On the question of its reality lies the very validity of this Church If it is the truth and I testify that it is then the work in which we are engaged is the most important work on the earth The Stone Cut Out of the Mountain Ensign or Liahona Nov 2007 86 President Hinckley s witness affirms a powerful lesson of a lifetime from a man I love and know was a prophet of God Elder Wirthlin delivered his final general conference message in October of 2008 I still remember my mother s advice to me given on that day long ago when my team lost a football game Come what may and love it Adversity if handled correctly can be a blessing in our lives As we look for humor seek for the eternal perspective understand the principle of compensation and draw near to our Heavenly Father we can endure hardship and trial We can say as did my mother Come what may and love it Come What May and Love It Ensign or Liahona Nov 2008 28 Elder Wirthlin s message is a powerful lesson of a lifetime from a man I love and who was a living sermon of overcoming difficulties through faith in the Savior Elder Perry stood at this pulpit just six months ago At that time we could not have imagined his testimony would be his last in a general conference Let me close by bearing witness and my nine decades on this earth fully qualify me to say this that the older I get the more I realize that family is the center of life and is the key to eternal happiness I give thanks for my wife for my children for my grandchildren and my great grandchildren and for extended family who make my own life so rich and yes even eternal Of this eternal truth I bear my strongest and most sacred witness Why Marriage and Family Matter Everywhere in the World Ensign or Liahona May 2015 42 Elder Perry s message is a powerful lesson of a lifetime from a man I love and who understood through vast experience the essential relationship between family and eternal happiness President Packer emphasized in general conference six months ago the Father s plan of happiness the Savior s Atonement and eternal families I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God He stands at the head of the Church Through His Atonement and the power of the priesthood families which are begun in mortality can be together through the eternities I am so grateful for the Atonement which can wash clean every stain no matter how difficult or how long or how many times repeated The Atonement can put you free again to move forward cleanly and worthily The Plan of Happiness Ensign or Liahona May 2015 28 President Packer s final message is a lesson of a lifetime from a man I love and who emphatically and repeatedly declared that the purpose of all activity in the Church is to see that a man and a woman with their children are happy at home sealed together for time and for all eternity Ensign or Liahona May 2015 26 Elder Scott proclaimed in his last general conference talk in October 2014 We came to mortal life precisely to grow from trials and testing Challenges help us become more like our Father in Heaven and the Atonement of Jesus Christ makes it possible to endure those challenges I testify that as we actively come unto Him we can endure every temptation every heartache every challenge we face Make the Exercise of Faith Your First Priority Ensign or Liahona Nov 2014 94 Elder Scott s message is a powerful lesson of a lifetime from a man I love and a beloved special witness of the name of Christ in all the world see D C 107 23 Promise and TestimonyThe Savior declared Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same D C 1 38 May we hear and heed the eternal truths taught by the Lord s authorized representatives As we do so I promise our faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will be fortified and we will receive spiritual guidance and protection for our specific circumstances and needs With all the energy of my soul I witness the resurrected and living Christ directs the affairs of His restored and living Church through His servants who have been chosen to bear testimony of His name I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I remember vividly an experience I had as a small boy One day while playing with my friends I accidentally broke a window in a store near our home As the glass shattered and the security alarm blared a paralyzing fear filled my heart and mind I realized immediately I was doomed to spend the remainder of my life in prison My parents eventually coaxed me out from a hiding place under my bed and helped me to make amends with the store owner Fortunately my jail sentence was commuted The fear I felt that day was overwhelming and real You undoubtedly have experienced much greater feelings of dread after learning about a personal health challenge discovering a family member in difficulty or danger or observing disturbing world events In such instances the distressing emotion of fear arises because of impending danger uncertainty or pain and through experiences that are unexpected sometimes sudden and likely to produce a negative outcome In our daily lives endless reports of criminal violence famine wars corruption terrorism declining values disease and the destructive forces of nature can engender fear and apprehension Surely we live in the season foretold by the Lord And in that day the whole earth shall be in commotion and men s hearts shall fail them D C 45 26 My purpose is to describe how fear is dispelled through a correct knowledge of and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ I earnestly pray the Holy Ghost will bless each of us as we consider together this important topic Mortal FearUpon hearing the voice of God after partaking of the forbidden fruit Adam and Eve hid themselves in the Garden of Eden God called unto Adam and asked Where art thou And Adam answered I heard thy voice and I was afraid Genesis 3 9 10 Notably one of the first effects of the Fall was for Adam and Eve to experience fear This potent emotion is an important element of our mortal existence An example from the Book of Mormon highlights the power of the knowledge of the Lord see 2 Peter 1 2 8 Alma 23 5 6 to dispel fear and provide peace even as we confront great adversity In the land of Helam Alma s people were frightened by an advancing Lamanite army But Alma went forth and stood among them and exhorted them that they should not be frightened but should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them Therefore they hushed their fears Mosiah 23 27 28 Notice Alma did not hush the people s fears Rather Alma counseled the believers to remember the Lord and the deliverance only He could bestow see 2 Nephi 2 8 And knowledge of the Savior s protecting watchcare enabled the people to hush their own fears Correct knowledge of and faith in the Lord empower us to hush our fears because Jesus Christ is the only source of enduring peace He declared Learn of me and listen to my words walk in the meekness of my Spirit and you shall have peace in me D C 19 23 The Master also explained He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come D C 59 23 Trust and confidence in Christ and a ready reliance on His merits mercy and grace lead to hope through His Atonement in the Resurrection and eternal life see Moroni 7 41 Such faith and hope invite into our lives the sweet peace of conscience for which we all yearn The power of the Atonement makes repentance possible and quells the despair caused by sin it also strengthens us to see do and become good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity Truly one of the great blessings of devoted discipleship is the peace of God which passeth all understanding Philippians 4 7 The peace Christ gives allows us to view mortality through the precious perspective of eternity and supplies a spiritual settledness see Colossians 1 23 that helps us maintain a consistent focus on our heavenly destination Thus we can be blessed to hush our fears because His doctrine provides purpose and direction in all aspects of our lives His ordinances and covenants fortify and comfort in times both good and bad And His priesthood authority gives assurance that the things that matter most can endure both in time and in eternity But can we hush the fears that so easily and frequently beset us in our contemporary world The answer to this question is an unequivocal yes Three basic principles are central to receiving this blessing in our lives 1 look to Christ 2 build upon the foundation of Christ and 3 press forward with faith in Christ Look to ChristThe counsel Alma gave to his son Helaman applies precisely to each of us today Yea see that ye look to God and live Alma 37 47 We should look to and have our focus firmly fixed upon the Savior at all times and in all places Recall how the Lord s Apostles were in a ship tossed in the midst of the sea Jesus went to them walking on the water but not recognizing Him they cried out in fear Jesus spake unto them saying Be of good cheer it is I be not afraid And Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water And he said Come Matthew 14 27 29 Peter then walked on the water to Jesus But when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid began to sink and cried out Lord save me And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt Matthew 14 30 31 I envision Peter responding fervently and immediately to the Savior s invitation With his eyes fixed upon Jesus he stepped out of the boat and miraculously walked on the water Only when his gaze was diverted by the wind and the waves did he become afraid and begin to sink We can be blessed to conquer our fears and strengthen our faith as we follow the Lord s instruction Look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not D C 6 36 Build upon the Foundation of ChristHelaman admonished his sons Nephi and Lehi Remember remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer who is Christ the Son of God that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds yea his shafts in the whirlwind yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo because of the rock upon which ye are built which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall Helaman 5 12 Ordinances and covenants are the building blocks we use to construct our lives upon the foundation of Christ and His Atonement We are connected securely to and with the Savior as we worthily receive ordinances and enter into covenants faithfully remember and honor those sacred commitments and do our best to live in accordance with the obligations we have accepted And that bond is the source of spiritual strength and stability in all of the seasons of our lives We can be blessed to hush our fears as we firmly establish our desires and deeds upon the sure foundation of the Savior through our ordinances and covenants Press Forward with Faith in ChristNephi declared Wherefore ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men Wherefore if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life 2 Nephi 31 20 The disciplined endurance described in this verse is the result of spiritual understanding and vision persistence patience and God s grace Exercising faith in and on the holy name of Jesus Christ meekly submitting to His will and timing in our lives and humbly acknowledging His hand in all things yield the peaceable things of the kingdom of God that bring joy and eternal life see D C 42 61 Even as we encounter difficulties and face the uncertainties of the future we can cheerfully persevere and live a peaceable life in all godliness and honesty 1 Timothy 2 2 We can be blessed to hush our fears as we receive the fortitude that comes from learning and living gospel principles and resolutely pressing forward on the covenant pathway The Fear of the LordDifferent from but related to the fears we often experience is what the scriptures describe as godly fear Hebrews 12 28 or the fear of the Lord Job 28 28 Proverbs 16 6 Isaiah 11 2 3 Unlike worldly fear that creates alarm and anxiety godly fear is a source of peace assurance and confidence But how can anything associated with fear be edifying or spiritually helpful The righteous fear I am attempting to describe encompasses a deep feeling of reverence respect and awe for the Lord Jesus Christ see Psalm 33 8 96 4 obedience to His commandments see Deuteronomy 5 29 8 6 10 12 13 4 Psalm 112 1 and anticipation of the Final Judgment and justice at His hand Thus godly fear grows out of a correct understanding of the divine nature and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ a willingness to submit our will to His will and a knowledge that every man and woman will be accountable for his or her own sins in the Day of Judgment see D C 101 78 Articles of Faith 1 2 As the scriptures certify godly fear is the beginning of knowledge Proverbs 1 7 the instruction of wisdom Proverbs 15 33 a strong confidence Proverbs 14 26 and a fountain of life Proverbs 14 27 Please note that godly fear is linked inextricably to an understanding of the Final Judgment and our individual accountability for our desires thoughts words and acts see Mosiah 4 30 The fear of the Lord is not a reluctant apprehension about coming into His presence to be judged I do not believe we will be afraid of Him at all Rather it is the prospect in His presence of facing things as they really are about ourselves and having a perfect knowledge 2 Nephi 9 14 see also Alma 11 43 of all our rationalizations pretenses and self deceptions Ultimately we will be left without excuse Every person who has lived or will yet live upon the earth shall be brought to stand before the bar of God to be judged of him according to his or her works whether they be good or whether they be evil Mosiah 16 10 If our desires have been for righteousness and our works good then the judgment bar will be pleasing see Jacob 6 13 Enos 1 27 Moroni 10 34 And at the last day we will be rewarded unto righteousness Alma 41 6 Conversely if our desires have been for evil and our works wicked then the judgment bar will be a cause of dread We shall not dare to look up to our God and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence Alma 12 14 And at the last day we will have our reward of evil Alma 41 5 As summarized in Ecclesiastes Fear God and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man For God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil Ecclesiastes 12 13 14 My beloved brothers and sisters godly fear dispels mortal fears It even subdues the haunting concern that we never can be good enough spiritually and never will measure up to the Lord s requirements and expectations In truth we cannot be good enough or measure up relying solely upon our own capacity and performance Our works and desires alone do not and cannot save us After all we can do 2 Nephi 25 23 we are made whole only through the mercy and grace available through the Savior s infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice see Alma 34 10 14 Certainly we believe that through the Atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel Articles of Faith 1 3 Godly fear is loving and trusting in Him As we fear God more completely we love Him more perfectly And perfect love casteth out all fear Moroni 8 16 I promise the bright light of godly fear will chase away the dark shadows of mortal fears see D C 50 25 as we look to the Savior build upon Him as our foundation and press forward on His covenant path with consecrated commitment Testimony and PromiseI love and revere the Lord His power and peace are real He is our Redeemer and I witness He lives And because of Him our hearts need not be troubled or afraid see John 14 27 and we will be blessed to hush our fears I so testify in the sacred and holy name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My message is directed specifically to individuals who are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I will address a fundamental question many of you may have Why are Latter day Saints so eager to tell me about what they believe and to invite me to learn about their church I pray the Spirit of the Lord will help me to communicate effectively and you to understand clearly my response to this important question A Divine CommissionDevoted disciples of Jesus Christ always have been and always will be valiant missionaries A missionary is a follower of Christ who testifies of Him as the Redeemer and proclaims the truths of His gospel The Church of Jesus Christ always has been and always will be a missionary church The individual members of the Savior s Church have accepted the solemn obligation to assist in fulfilling the divine commission given by the Lord to His Apostles as recorded in the New Testament Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world Amen Matthew 28 19 20 Latter day Saints take seriously this responsibility to teach all people in all nations about the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel We believe the same Church founded by the Savior anciently has been reestablished on the earth by Him in the latter days The doctrine principles priesthood authority ordinances and covenants of His gospel are found today in His Church When we invite you to attend church with us or to learn with the full time missionaries we are not trying to sell you a product As members of the Church we do not receive prizes or bonus points in a heavenly contest We are not seeking simply to increase the numerical size of the Church And most importantly we are not attempting to coerce you to believe as we do We are inviting you to hear the restored truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ so you can study ponder pray and come to know for yourself if the things we are sharing with you are true Some of you may respond But I already believe in Jesus and follow His teachings or I am not sure if God really exists Our invitations to you are not an attempt to diminish your religious tradition or life experience Bring all that you know is true good and praiseworthy and test our message Just as Jesus beckoned two of His disciples to come and see John 1 39 so we urge you to come and see if the restored gospel of Jesus Christ enlarges and enriches that which you already believe to be true Indeed we feel a solemn responsibility to carry this message to every nation kindred tongue and people And that is precisely what we are doing with a force today of more than 88 000 full time missionaries laboring in over 150 sovereign states around the world These remarkable men and women help the members of our Church fulfill the divinely appointed and individual responsibility each of us has to proclaim the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ see D C 68 1 More Than a Spiritual DutyBut our eagerness to declare this message is not merely the result of a sense of spiritual duty Rather our desire to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with you is a reflection of how important these truths are to us I believe I can best describe why we are so forthright in seeking to explain our beliefs to you through an experience my wife and I had many years ago with two of our sons One evening Susan and I stood near a window in our home and watched two of our little boys playing outside During the course of their adventures the younger of the two boys was injured slightly in a small accident We quickly recognized that he was not seriously hurt and we decided not to provide immediate assistance We wanted to observe and see if any of our family discussions about brotherly kindness had sunk in What happened next was both interesting and instructive The older brother consoled and carefully helped the younger brother back into the house Susan and I had positioned ourselves near the kitchen so we could see what next took place and we were prepared to intervene immediately if additional bodily harm seemed likely or a serious accident was imminent The older brother dragged a chair to the kitchen sink He climbed up on the chair assisted his brother onto the chair turned on the water and proceeded to pour a large quantity of dishwashing soap onto the scratched arm of his little brother He did his best to gently wash away the dirt The reaction of the little brother to this procedure can only be described accurately using language from the holy scriptures And they shall have cause to howl and weep and wail and gnash their teeth Mosiah 16 2 And did that little boy howl After the scrubbing was finished the arm was carefully dried with a towel Eventually the screaming stopped The older brother next climbed up onto the kitchen counter opened a cabinet and found a new tube of medicated ointment Though the scratches on his little brother were not large or extensive the older brother applied almost all of the ointment in the tube to the entire injured arm The screaming did not resume as the little brother clearly liked the soothing effect of the ointment much more than he appreciated the cleansing effect of the dishwashing soap The older brother returned again to the cabinet in which he had found the ointment and located a new box of sterile bandages He then unwrapped and put bandages all up and down his brother s arm from the wrist to the elbow With the emergency resolved and with soap bubbles ointment and wrappers all over the kitchen the two little boys hopped down from the chair with bright smiles and happy faces What happened next is most important The injured brother gathered up the remaining bandages and the almost empty tube of ointment and he went back outside He quickly sought out his friends and began to put ointment and bandages on their arms Susan and I both were struck by the sincerity enthusiasm and rapidity of his response Why did that little boy do what he did Please note that he immediately and intuitively wanted to give to his friends the very thing that had helped him when he was hurt That little boy did not have to be urged challenged prompted or goaded to act His desire to share was the natural consequence of a most helpful and beneficial personal experience Many of us as adults behave in precisely the same way when we find a treatment or medication that alleviates pain with which we have long suffered or we receive counsel that enables us to face challenges with courage and perplexities with patience Sharing with other people things that are most meaningful to us or have helped us is not unusual at all This same pattern is especially evident in matters of great spiritual importance and consequence For example an account in a volume of scripture known as the Book of Mormon highlights a dream received by an ancient prophet leader named Lehi The central feature in Lehi s dream is the tree of life which is a representation of the love of God that is most desirable above all things and most joyous to the soul 1 Nephi 11 22 23 see also 1 Nephi 8 12 15 Lehi explained And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof and I beheld that it was most sweet above all that I ever before tasted Yea and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also 1 Nephi 8 11 12 emphasis added The greatest manifestation of God s love for His children is the mortal ministry atoning sacrifice and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ The fruit on the tree can be considered a symbol for the blessings of the Savior s Atonement Lehi s instant response to partaking of the fruit of the tree and experiencing great joy was an increased desire to share with and serve his family Thus as he turned to Christ he also turned outward in love and service Another important episode in the Book of Mormon describes what happened to a man named Enos after his earnest and pleading prayer was heard and answered by God He said And my soul hungered and I kneeled down before my Maker and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul and all the day long did I cry unto him yea and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens And there came a voice unto me saying Enos thy sins are forgiven thee and thou shalt be blessed And I Enos knew that God could not lie wherefore my guilt was swept away And I said Lord how is it done And he said unto me Because of thy faith in Christ whom thou hast never before heard nor seen Wherefore go to thy faith hath made thee whole Now it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren the Nephites wherefore I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them Enos 1 4 9 emphasis added As Enos turned to the Lord with full purpose of heart 2 Nephi 31 13 his concern for the welfare of his family friends and associates increased simultaneously The enduring lesson we learn from these two episodes is the importance of experiencing in our personal lives the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ as a prerequisite to heartfelt and authentic service that stretches far beyond merely going through the motions Much like Lehi Enos and our little boy in the story I recounted we as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints have felt the anguish associated with spiritual uncertainty and sin We also have experienced the cleansing the peace of conscience the spiritual healing and renewal and the guidance that are obtained only by learning and living the principles of the Savior s gospel The Atonement of Jesus Christ provides the cleanser necessary to be made pure and clean the soothing salve to heal spiritual wounds and remove guilt and the protection that enables us to be faithful in times both good and bad Absolute Truth ExistsTo you family members and friends who are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I have attempted to explain fundamental reasons why we are missionaries Absolute truth exists in a world that increasingly disdains and dismisses absolutes In a future day every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Philippians 2 10 11 Jesus the Christ absolutely is the Only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father As members of His Church we witness He lives and His Church has been restored in its fulness in these latter days The invitations we extend to you to learn about and test our message grow out of the positive effects the gospel of Jesus Christ has had in our lives Sometimes we may be awkward or abrupt or even relentless in our attempts Our simple desire is to share with you the truths that are of greatest worth to us As one of the Lord s Apostles and with all of the energy of my soul I bear witness of His divinity and reality And I invite you to come and see John 1 39 in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
I have a dear friend who in the early years of his marriage was convinced he and his family needed a four wheel drive pickup truck His wife was sure that he did not need but merely wanted the new vehicle A playful conversation between this husband and wife initiated their consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of such a purchase Sweetheart we need a four wheel drive truck She asked Why do you think we need a new truck He answered her question with what he believed was the perfect response What if we needed milk for our children in a terrible storm and the only way I could get to the grocery store was in a pickup His wife replied with a smile If we buy a new truck we will not have money for milk so why worry about getting to the store in an emergency Over time they continued to counsel together and ultimately decided to acquire the truck Shortly after taking possession of the new vehicle my friend wanted to demonstrate the utility of the truck and validate his reasons for wanting to purchase it So he decided he would cut and haul a supply of firewood for their home It was in the autumn of the year and snow already had fallen in the mountains where he intended to find wood As he drove up the mountainside the snow gradually became deeper and deeper My friend recognized the slick road conditions presented a risk but with great confidence in the new truck he kept going Sadly my friend went too far along the snowy road As he steered the truck off of the road at the place he had determined to cut wood he got stuck All four of the wheels on the new truck spun in the snow He readily recognized that he did not know what to do to extricate himself from this dangerous situation He was embarrassed and worried My friend decided Well I will not just sit here He climbed out of the vehicle and started cutting wood He completely filled the back of the truck with the heavy load And then my friend determined he would try driving out of the snow one more time As he put the pickup into gear and applied power he started to inch forward Slowly the truck moved out of the snow and back onto the road He finally was free to go home a happy and humbled man Our Individual LoadI pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as I emphasize vital lessons that can be learned from this story about my friend the truck and the wood It was the load It was the load of wood that provided the traction necessary for him to get out of the snow to get back on the road and to move forward It was the load that enabled him to return to his family and his home Each of us also carries a load Our individual load is comprised of demands and opportunities obligations and privileges afflictions and blessings and options and constraints Two guiding questions can be helpful as we periodically and prayerfully assess our load Is the load I am carrying producing the spiritual traction that will enable me to press forward with faith in Christ on the strait and narrow path and avoid getting stuck Is the load I am carrying creating sufficient spiritual traction so I ultimately can return home to Heavenly Father Sometimes we mistakenly may believe that happiness is the absence of a load But bearing a load is a necessary and essential part of the plan of happiness Because our individual load needs to generate spiritual traction we should be careful to not haul around in our lives so many nice but unnecessary things that we are distracted and diverted from the things that truly matter most The Strengthening Power of the AtonementThe Savior said Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls For my yoke is easy and my burden is light Matthew 11 28 30 A yoke is a wooden beam normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals that enables them to pull together on a load A yoke places animals side by side so they can move together in order to accomplish a task Consider the Lord s uniquely individual invitation to take my yoke upon you Making and keeping sacred covenants yokes us to and with the Lord Jesus Christ In essence the Savior is beckoning us to rely upon and pull together with Him even though our best efforts are not equal to and cannot be compared with His As we trust in and pull our load with Him during the journey of mortality truly His yoke is easy and His burden is light We are not and never need be alone We can press forward in our daily lives with heavenly help Through the Savior s Atonement we can receive capacity and strength beyond our own Lord I Would Follow Thee Hymns no 220 As the Lord declared Therefore continue your journey and let your hearts rejoice for behold and lo I am with you even unto the end D C 100 12 Consider the example in the Book of Mormon as Amulon persecuted Alma and his people The voice of the Lord came to these disciples in their afflictions Lift up your heads and be of good comfort for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage Mosiah 24 13 Note the centrality of covenants to the promise of deliverance Covenants received and honored with integrity and ordinances performed by proper priesthood authority are necessary to receive all of the blessings made available through the Atonement of Jesus Christ For in the ordinances of the priesthood the power of godliness is manifest unto men and women in the flesh including the blessings of the Atonement see D C 84 20 21 Recall the Savior s statement For my yoke is easy and my burden is light Matthew 11 30 as we consider the next verse in the account of Alma and his people And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders that even you cannot feel them upon your backs Mosiah 24 14 Many of us may assume this scripture is suggesting that a burden suddenly and permanently will be taken away The next verse however describes how the burden was eased And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light yea the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord Mosiah 24 15 emphasis added The challenges and difficulties were not immediately removed from the people But Alma and his followers were strengthened and their increased capacity made the burdens lighter These good people were empowered through the Atonement to act as agents see D C 58 26 29 and impact their circumstances And in the strength of the Lord Words of Mormon 1 14 Mosiah 9 17 10 10 Alma 20 4 Alma and his people were directed to safety in the land of Zarahemla Not only does the Atonement of Jesus Christ overcome the effects of the Fall of Adam and make possible the remission of our individual sins and transgressions but His Atonement also enables us to do good and become better in ways that stretch far beyond our mortal capacities Most of us know that when we do things wrong and need help to overcome the effects of sin in our lives the Savior has made it possible for us to become clean through His redeeming power But do we also understand that the Atonement is for faithful men and women who are obedient worthy and conscientious and who are striving to become better and serve more faithfully I wonder if we fail to fully acknowledge this strengthening aspect of the Atonement in our lives and mistakenly believe we must carry our load all alone through sheer grit willpower and discipline and with our obviously limited capacities It is one thing to know that Jesus Christ came to the earth to die for us But we also need to appreciate that the Lord desires through His Atonement and by the power of the Holy Ghost to enliven us not only to guide but also to strengthen and heal us The Savior Succors His PeopleAlma explains why and how the Savior can enable us And he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities Alma 7 11 12 Thus the Savior has suffered not just for our sins and iniquities but also for our physical pains and anguish our weaknesses and shortcomings our fears and frustrations our disappointments and discouragement our regrets and remorse our despair and desperation the injustices and inequities we experience and the emotional distresses that beset us There is no physical pain no spiritual wound no anguish of soul or heartache no infirmity or weakness you or I ever confront in mortality that the Savior did not experience first In a moment of weakness we may cry out No one knows what it is like No one understands But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands for He has felt and borne our individual burdens And because of His infinite and eternal sacrifice see Alma 34 14 He has perfect empathy and can extend to us His arm of mercy He can reach out touch succor heal and strengthen us to be more than we could ever be and help us to do that which we could never do relying only upon our own power Indeed His yoke is easy and His burden is light An Invitation a Promise and a TestimonyI invite you to study pray ponder and strive to learn more about the Savior s Atonement as you assess your individual load Many things about the Atonement we simply cannot comprehend with our mortal minds But many aspects of the Atonement we can and need to understand For my friend the load of wood provided life saving traction The empty truck could not move through the snow even equipped with four wheel drive A heavy load was necessary to produce traction It was the load It was the load that provided the traction that enabled my friend to get unstuck to get back on the road to press forward and to return to his family The unique burdens in each of our lives help us to rely upon the merits mercy and grace of the Holy Messiah see 2 Nephi 2 8 I testify and promise the Savior will help us to bear up our burdens with ease see Mosiah 24 15 As we are yoked with Him through sacred covenants and receive the enabling power of His Atonement in our lives we increasingly will seek to understand and live according to His will We also will pray for the strength to learn from change or accept our circumstances rather than praying relentlessly for God to change our circumstances according to our will We will become agents who act rather than objects that are acted upon see 2 Nephi 2 14 We will be blessed with spiritual traction May each of us do and become better through the Savior s Atonement Today is April 6 We know by revelation that today is the actual and accurate date of the Savior s birth April 6 also is the day on which The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints was organized See D C 20 1 Harold B Lee Strengthen the Stakes of Zion Ensign July 1973 2 Spencer W Kimball Why Call Me Lord Lord and Do Not the Things Which I Say Ensign May 1975 4 Spencer W Kimball Remarks and Dedication of the Fayette New York Buildings Ensign May 1980 54 Discourses of President Gordon B Hinckley Volume 1 1995 1999 2005 409 On this special and sacred Sabbath day I declare my witness that Jesus the Christ is our Redeemer He lives and will cleanse heal guide protect and strengthen us Of these things I joyfully testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I want to describe two important lessons I have learned about the law of tithing The first lesson focuses upon the blessings that come to individuals and families as they faithfully obey this commandment The second lesson emphasizes the importance of tithing in the growth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in all of the world I pray the Holy Ghost will confirm to each of us the truthfulness of the principles I discuss Lesson Number 1 Significant but Subtle BlessingsSister Bednar s mother is a faithful woman and an inspired homemaker From the earliest days of her marriage she carefully has kept the household financial records For decades she has accounted conscientiously for the family income and expenditures using very simple ledgers The information she has collected over the years is comprehensive and informative When Sister Bednar was a young woman her mother used the data in the ledgers to emphasize basic principles of provident living and prudent home management One day as they reviewed together various categories of expenses her mother noted an interesting pattern The costs for doctor visits and medicines for their family were far lower than might have been expected She then related this finding to the gospel of Jesus Christ and explained to her daughter a powerful truth as we live the law of tithing we often receive significant but subtle blessings that are not always what we expect and easily can be overlooked The family had not received any sudden or obvious additions to the household income Instead a loving Heavenly Father had bestowed simple blessings in seemingly ordinary ways Sister Bednar always has remembered this important lesson from her mother about the help that comes to us through the windows of heaven as promised by Malachi in the Old Testament see Malachi 3 10 Often as we teach and testify about the law of tithing we emphasize the immediate dramatic and readily recognizable temporal blessings that we receive And surely such blessings do occur Yet some of the diverse blessings we obtain as we are obedient to this commandment are significant but subtle Such blessings can be discerned only if we are both spiritually attentive and observant see 1 Corinthians 2 14 The imagery of the windows of heaven used by Malachi is most instructive Windows allow natural light to enter into a building In like manner spiritual illumination and perspective are poured out through the windows of heaven and into our lives as we honor the law of tithing For example a subtle but significant blessing we receive is the spiritual gift of gratitude that enables our appreciation for what we have to constrain desires for what we want A grateful person is rich in contentment An ungrateful person suffers in the poverty of endless discontentment see Luke 12 15 We may need and pray for help to find suitable employment Eyes and ears of faith see Ether 12 19 are needed however to recognize the spiritual gift of enhanced discernment that can empower us to identify job opportunities that many other people might overlook or the blessing of greater personal determination to search harder and longer for a position than other people may be able or willing to do We might want and expect a job offer but the blessing that comes to us through heavenly windows may be greater capacity to act and change our own circumstances rather than expecting our circumstances to be changed by someone or something else We may appropriately desire and work to receive a pay raise in our employment to better provide the necessities of life Eyes and ears of faith are required however to notice in us an increased spiritual and temporal capacity see Luke 2 52 to do more with less a keener ability to prioritize and simplify and an enhanced ability to take proper care of the material possessions we already have acquired We might want and expect a larger paycheck but the blessing that comes to us through heavenly windows may be greater capacity to change our own circumstances rather than expecting our circumstances to be changed by someone or something else The stripling warriors in the Book of Mormon see Alma 53 56 58 prayed earnestly that God would strengthen and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies Interestingly the answers to these prayers did not produce additional weapons or an increased number of troops Instead God granted these faithful warriors assurance that He would deliver them peace to their souls and great faith and hope for their deliverance in Him see Alma 58 11 Thus the sons of Helaman did take courage were fixed with a determination to conquer and did go forth with all of their might against the Lamanites see Alma 58 12 13 Assurance peace faith and hope initially might not seem like the blessings warriors in battle might want but they were precisely the blessings these valiant young men needed to press forward and prevail physically and spiritually Sometimes we may ask God for success and He gives us physical and mental stamina We might plead for prosperity and we receive enlarged perspective and increased patience or we petition for growth and are blessed with the gift of grace He may bestow upon us conviction and confidence as we strive to achieve worthy goals And when we plead for relief from physical mental and spiritual difficulties He may increase our resolve and resilience I promise that as you and I observe and keep the law of tithing indeed the windows of heaven will be opened and spiritual and temporal blessings will be poured out such that there shall not be room enough to receive them see Malachi 3 10 We also will remember the Lord s declaration For my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord For as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts Isaiah 55 8 9 I testify that as we are spiritually attentive and observant we will be blessed with eyes that see more clearly ears that hear more consistently and hearts that understand more fully the significance and subtlety of His ways His thoughts and His blessings in our lives Lesson Number 2 the Simplicity of the Lord s WayBefore my call to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve I read many times in the Doctrine and Covenants about the council appointed to oversee and disburse sacred tithing funds The Council on the Disposition of the Tithes was established by revelation and consists of the First Presidency the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the Presiding Bishopric see D C 120 As I prepared in December of 2004 to attend my first meeting of this council I eagerly anticipated a most remarkable learning opportunity I still remember the things I experienced and felt in that council I gained a greater appreciation and reverence for the Lord s laws of finance for individuals for families and for His Church The basic financial program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints for both income and disbursement is defined in sections 119 and 120 of the Doctrine and Covenants Two statements found in these revelations provide the foundation for the fiscal affairs of the Church Section 119 simply states that all members shall pay one tenth of all their interest annually and this shall be a standing law unto them forever saith the Lord verse 4 Then concerning the authorized disbursement of the tithes the Lord said It shall be disposed of by a council composed of the First Presidency of my Church and of the bishop and his council and by my high council and by mine own voice unto them saith the Lord D C 120 1 The bishop and his council and my high council referred to in this revelation are known today as the Presiding Bishopric and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles respectively These sacred funds are used in a rapidly growing church to spiritually bless individuals and families by constructing and maintaining temples and houses of worship supporting missionary work translating and publishing scriptures fostering family history research funding schools and religious education and accomplishing many other Church purposes as directed by the Lord s ordained servants I marvel at the clarity and brevity of these two revelations in comparison to the complicated financial guidelines and administrative procedures used in so many organizations and governments around the world How can the temporal affairs of an organization as large as the restored Church of Jesus Christ possibly operate throughout the entire world using such succinct instructions To me the answer is quite straightforward this is the Lord s work He is able to do His own work see 2 Nephi 27 20 and the Savior inspires and directs His servants as they apply His directions and labor in His cause In that first council meeting I was impressed by the simplicity of the principles that guided our deliberations and decisions In the financial operations of the Church two basic and fixed principles are observed First the Church lives within its means and does not spend more than it receives Second a portion of the annual income is set aside as a reserve for contingencies and unanticipated needs For decades the Church has taught its membership the principle of setting aside additional food fuel and money to take care of emergencies that might arise The Church as an institution simply follows the same principles that are taught repeatedly to the members As the meeting progressed I found myself wishing that all members of the Church could observe the simplicity the clarity the orderliness the charity and the power of the Lord s own way see D C 104 16 for conducting the temporal affairs of His Church I have now participated in the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes for many years My gratitude and reverence for the Lord s pattern has grown each year and the lessons learned have become even more profound My heart swells with love and admiration for the faithful and obedient members of this Church from every nation kindred tongue and people As I travel the earth I learn about your hopes and dreams your varied living conditions and circumstances and your struggles I have attended Church meetings with you and visited in some of your homes Your faith strengthens my faith Your devotion makes me more devoted And your goodness and willing obedience to the law of tithing inspires me to be a better man husband father and Church leader I remember and think of you each time I participate in the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes Thank you for your goodness and faithfulness as you honor your covenants The leaders of the Lord s restored Church feel a tremendous responsibility to care appropriately for the consecrated offerings of Church members We are keenly aware of the sacred nature of the widow s mite And Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much And there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing And he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them Verily I say unto you That this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury For all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living Mark 12 41 44 I know from firsthand experience that the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes is vigilant in caring for the widow s mite I express appreciation to President Thomas S Monson and his counselors for their effective leadership in discharging this holy stewardship And I acknowledge the voice see D C 120 1 and hand of the Lord that sustain His ordained servants in fulfilling the duty to represent Him An Invitation and a TestimonyThe honest payment of tithing is much more than a duty it is an important step in the process of personal sanctification To those of you who pay your tithing I commend you To those of you who presently are not obeying the law of tithing I invite you to consider your ways and repent I testify that by your obedience to this law of the Lord the windows of heaven will be opened to you Please do not procrastinate the day of your repentance I testify spiritual and temporal blessings come into our lives as we live the law of tithing I bear witness that such blessings often are significant but subtle I also declare that the simplicity of the Lord s way that is so evident in the temporal affairs of His Church provides patterns that can guide us as individuals and as families I pray each of us may learn and benefit from these important lessons in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My message addresses a fundamental question of great spiritual consequence Why is the law of chastity so important I pray the Holy Ghost will confirm the truthfulness of the principles I emphasize The Father s Plan of HappinessThe eternal importance of chastity can only be understood within the overarching context of our Heavenly Father s plan of happiness for His children All human beings male and female are created in the image of God Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents and has a divine nature and destiny The Family A Proclamation to the World Ensign or Liahona Nov 2010 129 All men and women lived with God as His spirit children before coming to the earth as mortal beings The Father s plan enables His spirit sons and daughters to obtain physical bodies to gain mortal experience and to progress toward exaltation The Importance of a Physical BodyOur physical bodies make possible a breadth a depth and an intensity of experience that simply could not be obtained in our premortal existence Thus our relationships with other people our capacity to recognize and act in accordance with truth and our ability to obey the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ are amplified through our physical bodies In the school of mortality we experience tenderness love kindness happiness sorrow disappointment pain and even the challenges of physical limitations in ways that prepare us for eternity Simply stated there are lessons we must learn and experiences we must have as the scriptures describe according to the flesh 1 Nephi 19 6 Alma 7 12 13 The Power of ProcreationAfter the earth was created Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden Importantly however God said it was not good that the man should be alone Moses 3 18 see also Genesis 2 18 and Eve became Adam s wife and helpmeet The unique combination of spiritual physical mental and emotional capacities of both males and females was needed to enact the plan of happiness Neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord 1 Corinthians 11 11 The man and the woman are intended to learn from strengthen bless and complete each other The means by which mortal life is created is divinely appointed The first commandment God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife Ensign or Liahona Nov 2010 129 The commandment to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force today Thus marriage between a man and a woman is the authorized channel through which premortal spirits enter mortality Complete sexual abstinence before marriage and total fidelity within marriage protect the sanctity of this sacred channel The power of procreation is spiritually significant Misuse of this power subverts the purposes of the Father s plan and of our mortal existence Our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son are creators and have entrusted each of us with a portion of Their creative power Specific guidelines for the proper use of the ability to create life are vital elements in the Father s plan How we feel about and use that supernal power will determine in large measure our happiness in mortality and our destiny in eternity Elder Dallin H Oaks explained The power to create mortal life is the most exalted power God has given his children Its use was mandated in the first commandment but another important commandment was given to forbid its misuse The emphasis we place on the law of chastity is explained by our understanding of the purpose of our procreative powers in the accomplishment of God s plan Outside the bonds of marriage all uses of the procreative power are to one degree or another a sinful degrading and perversion of the most divine attribute of men and women The Great Plan of Happiness Ensign Nov 1993 74 The Standard of Sexual MoralityThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has a single undeviating standard of sexual morality intimate relations are proper only between a man and a woman in the marriage relationship prescribed in God s plan Such relations are not merely a curiosity to be explored an appetite to be satisfied or a type of recreation or entertainment to be pursued selfishly They are not a conquest to be achieved or simply an act to be performed Rather they are in mortality one of the ultimate expressions of our divine nature and potential and a way of strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife We are agents blessed with moral agency and are defined by our divine heritage as children of God and not by sexual behaviors contemporary attitudes or secular philosophies The Natural ManTo some degree the natural man described by King Benjamin is alive and well in each of us see Mosiah 3 19 The natural man or woman is unrepentant is carnal and sensual see Mosiah 16 5 Alma 42 10 Moses 5 13 is indulgent and excessive and is prideful and selfish As President Spencer W Kimball taught The natural man is the earthy man who has allowed rude animal passions to overshadow his spiritual inclinations Ocean Currents and Family Influences Ensign Nov 1974 112 In contrast the man or woman of Christ Helaman 3 29 is spiritual and bridles all passions see Alma 38 12 is temperate and restrained and is benevolent and selfless Men and women of Christ lay hold upon the word of God deny themselves and take up His cross see Matthew 16 24 Mark 8 34 Luke 9 23 D C 56 2 and press forward along a strait and narrow course of faithfulness obedience and devotion to the Savior and His gospel As sons and daughters of God we have inherited divine capacities from Him But we presently live in a fallen world The very elements out of which our bodies were created are by nature fallen and ever subject to the pull of sin corruption and death Consequently the Fall of Adam and its spiritual and temporal consequences affect us most directly through our physical bodies And yet we are dual beings for our spirit that is the eternal part of us is tabernacled in a physical body that is subject to the Fall As Jesus emphasized to the Apostle Peter The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak Matthew 26 41 The precise nature of the test of mortality then can be summarized in the following question Will I respond to the inclinations of the natural man or will I yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and put off the natural man and become a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord see Mosiah 3 19 That is the test Every appetite desire propensity and impulse of the natural man may be overcome by and through the Atonement of Jesus Christ We are here on the earth to develop godlike qualities and to bridle all of the passions of the flesh The Intent of the AdversaryThe Father s plan is designed to provide direction for His children to help them become happy and to bring them safely home to Him with resurrected exalted bodies Heavenly Father desires us to be together in the light and filled with hope In contrast Lucifer labors to make the sons and daughters of God confused and unhappy and to hinder their eternal progression The overarching intent of the father of lies is that all of us would become miserable like unto himself 2 Nephi 2 27 Lucifer wants us ultimately to be alone in the dark and without hope Satan relentlessly works to distort the most important elements of the Father s plan He does not have a body and his eternal progress has been halted Just as water flowing in a riverbed is stopped by a dam so the adversary s eternal progress is thwarted because he does not have a physical body Because of his rebellion Lucifer has denied himself all of the mortal blessings and experiences made possible through a body of flesh and bones He cannot learn the lessons that only an embodied spirit can learn He resents the reality of a literal and universal resurrection of all mankind One of the potent scriptural meanings of the word damned is illustrated in his inability to continue developing and becoming like our Heavenly Father Because a physical body is so central to the Father s plan of happiness and our spiritual development Lucifer seeks to frustrate our progression by tempting us to use our bodies improperly One of the ultimate ironies of eternity is that the adversary who is miserable precisely because he has no physical body entices us to share in his misery through the improper use of our bodies The very tool he does not have is thus the primary target of his attempts to lure us to spiritual destruction Violating the law of chastity is a grievous sin and a misuse of our physical tabernacles To those who know and understand the plan of salvation defiling the body is an act of rebellion see Mosiah 2 36 37 D C 64 34 35 and a denial of our true identity as sons and daughters of God As we look beyond mortality and into eternity it is easy to discern that the counterfeit companionship advocated by the adversary is temporary and empty The Blessings of Being ChasteAlma counseled his son Shiblon to bridle all of his passions that he may be filled with love Alma 38 12 Significantly disciplining the natural man in each of us makes possible a richer a deeper and a more enduring love of God and of His children Love increases through righteous restraint and decreases through impulsive indulgence President Marion G Romney declared I can think of no blessings to be more fervently desired than those promised to the pure and the virtuous Jesus spoke of specific rewards for different virtues but reserved the greatest so it seems to me for the pure in heart for they said he shall see God Matt 5 8 And not only shall they see the Lord but they shall feel at home in his presence Here is the Savior s promise Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God D C 121 45 Trust in the Lord Ensign May 1979 42 We also are promised that as we pursue the pathway of virtue the Holy Ghost shall be our constant companion D C 121 46 Thus living the law of chastity invites some of the greatest blessings men and women can receive in mortality appropriate spiritual confidence in the presence of family friends Church associates and ultimately the Savior Our innate longing to belong is fulfilled in righteousness as we walk in the light with hope The Principle of RepentanceSome of you who receive this message need to repent of sexual or other sins The Savior is often referred to as the Great Physician and this title has both symbolic and literal significance All of us have experienced the pain associated with a physical injury or wound When we are in pain we typically seek relief and are grateful for the medication and treatments that help to alleviate our suffering Consider sin as a spiritual wound that causes guilt or as described by Alma to his son Corianton remorse of conscience Alma 42 18 Guilt is to our spirit what pain is to our body a warning of danger and a protection from additional damage From the Atonement of the Savior flows the soothing salve that can heal our spiritual wounds and remove guilt However this salve can only be applied through the principles of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ repentance and consistent obedience The results of sincere repentance are peace of conscience comfort and spiritual healing and renewal Your bishop or branch president is the spiritual physician s assistant who is authorized to help you repent and heal Please remember however that the extent and intensity of your repentance must match the nature and severity of your sins especially for Latter day Saints who are under sacred covenant Serious spiritual wounds require sustained treatment and time to heal completely and fully A Promise and a TestimonyThe doctrine I have described will seem to be archaic and outdated to many people in a world that increasingly mocks the sanctity of procreation and minimizes the worth of human life But the Lord s truth is not altered by fads popularity or public opinion polls I promise that obedience to the law of chastity will increase our happiness in mortality and make possible our progress in eternity Chastity and virtue are now always have been and always will be most dear and precious above all things Moroni 9 9 I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My message focuses upon the relationship between receiving a testimony that Jesus is the Christ and becoming converted to Him and His gospel Typically we treat the topics of testimony and conversion separately and independently However we gain precious perspective and greater spiritual conviction as we consider these two important subjects together I pray the Holy Ghost will instruct and edify each of us Whom Say Ye That I Am We can learn much about testimony and conversion from the ministry of the Apostle Peter As Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi He posed this penetrating question to His disciples Whom say ye that I am Peter responded forthrightly Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God And Jesus answered and said unto him Blessed art thou Simon Bar jona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven Matthew 16 15 17 As is evidenced in Peter s reply and the Savior s instruction a testimony is personal knowledge of spiritual truth obtained by revelation A testimony is a gift from God and is available to all of His children Any honest seeker of truth can obtain a testimony by exercising the necessary particle of faith in Jesus Christ to experiment upon Alma 32 27 and try the virtue of the word Alma 31 5 to yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit Mosiah 3 19 and to awaken unto God see Alma 5 7 Testimony brings increased personal accountability and is a source of purpose assurance and joy Seeking for and obtaining a testimony of spiritual truth requires asking seeking and knocking see Matthew 7 7 3 Nephi 14 7 with a sincere heart real intent and faith in the Savior see Moroni 10 4 Fundamental components of a testimony are knowing that Heavenly Father lives and loves us that Jesus Christ is our Savior and that the fulness of the gospel has been restored to the earth in these latter days When Thou Art ConvertedAs the Savior taught His disciples at the Last Supper He said to Peter Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to sift you as wheat But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren Luke 22 31 32 Interestingly this mighty Apostle had talked and walked with the Master had witnessed many miracles and had a strong testimony of the Savior s divinity Yet even Peter needed additional instruction from Jesus about the converting and sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost and his obligation to serve faithfully The essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through the Savior s Atonement True conversion brings a change in one s beliefs heart and life to accept and conform to the will of God see Acts 3 19 3 Nephi 9 20 and includes a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ Conversion is an enlarging a deepening and a broadening of the undergirding base of testimony It is the result of revelation from God accompanied by individual repentance obedience and diligence Any honest seeker of truth can become converted by experiencing the mighty change of heart and being spiritually born of God see Alma 5 12 14 As we honor the ordinances and covenants of salvation and exaltation see D C 20 25 press forward with a steadfastness in Christ 2 Nephi 31 20 and endure in faith to the end see D C 14 7 we become new creatures in Christ see 2 Corinthians 5 17 Conversion is an offering of self of love and of loyalty we give to God in gratitude for the gift of testimony Book of Mormon Examples of ConversionThe Book of Mormon is filled with inspiring accounts of conversion Amaleki a descendant of Jacob declared I would that ye should come unto Christ who is the Holy One of Israel and partake of his salvation and the power of his redemption Yea come unto him and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him Omni 1 26 Knowing by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ is important and necessary But earnestly coming unto Him and giving our whole souls as an offering requires much more than merely knowing Conversion requires all of our heart all of our might and all of our mind and strength see D C 4 2 King Benjamin s people responded to his teaching by exclaiming Yea we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us and also we know of their surety and truth because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent which has wrought a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually Mosiah 5 2 Accepting the words spoken gaining a testimony of their truthfulness and exercising faith in Christ produced a mighty change of heart and a firm determination to improve and become better Converted Lamanites in the book of Helaman are described as being in the path of their duty and they do walk circumspectly before God and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments And they are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth Helaman 15 5 6 As these examples highlight the key characteristics associated with conversion are experiencing a mighty change in our hearts having a disposition to do good continually going forward in the path of duty walking circumspectly before God keeping the commandments and serving with unwearied diligence Clearly these faithful souls had become deeply devoted to the Lord and His teachings Becoming ConvertedFor many of us conversion is an ongoing process and not a onetime event that results from a powerful or dramatic experience Line upon line and precept upon precept gradually and almost imperceptibly our motives our thoughts our words and our deeds become aligned with the will of God Conversion unto the Lord requires both persistence and patience Samuel the Lamanite identified five basic elements in becoming converted unto the Lord 1 believing in the teachings and prophecies of the holy prophets as they are recorded in the scriptures 2 exercising faith in the Lord Jesus Christ 3 repenting 4 experiencing a mighty change of heart and 5 becoming firm and steadfast in the faith see Helaman 15 7 8 This is the pattern that leads to conversion Testimony and ConversionTestimony is the beginning of and a prerequisite to continuing conversion Testimony is a point of departure it is not an ultimate destination Strong testimony is the foundation upon which conversion is established Testimony alone is not and will not be enough to protect us in the latter day storm of darkness and evil in which we are living Testimony is important and necessary but not sufficient to provide the spiritual strength and protection we need Some members of the Church with testimonies have wavered and fallen away Their spiritual knowledge and commitment did not measure up to the challenges they faced An important lesson about the connection between testimony and conversion is evident in the missionary labors of the sons of Mosiah As many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy and the power of God working miracles in them yea as the Lord liveth as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching and were converted unto the Lord never did fall away For they became a righteous people they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion that they did not fight against God any more Now these are they who were converted unto the Lord Alma 23 6 8 Two major elements are described in these verses 1 the knowledge of the truth which may be interpreted as a testimony and 2 converted unto the Lord which I understand to be conversion to the Savior and His gospel Thus the powerful combination of both testimony and conversion unto the Lord produced firmness and steadfastness and provided spiritual protection They never did fall away and surrendered the weapons of their rebellion that they did not fight against God any more To set aside cherished weapons of rebellion such as selfishness pride and disobedience requires more than merely believing and knowing Conviction humility repentance and submissiveness precede the abandonment of our weapons of rebellion Do you and I still possess weapons of rebellion that keep us from becoming converted unto the Lord If so then we need to repent now Note that the Lamanites were not converted to the missionaries who taught them or to the excellent programs of the Church They were not converted to the personalities of their leaders or to preserving a cultural heritage or the traditions of their fathers They were converted unto the Lord to Him as the Savior and to His divinity and doctrine and they never did fall away A testimony is spiritual knowledge of truth obtained by the power of the Holy Ghost Continuing conversion is constant devotion to the revealed truth we have received with a heart that is willing and for righteous reasons Knowing that the gospel is true is the essence of a testimony Consistently being true to the gospel is the essence of conversion We should know the gospel is true and be true to the gospel Testimony Conversion and the Parable of the Ten VirginsI now want to use one of many possible interpretations of the parable of the ten virgins to highlight the relationship between testimony and conversion Ten virgins five who were wise and five who were foolish took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom Please think of the lamps used by the virgins as the lamps of testimony The foolish virgins took their lamps of testimony but took no oil with them Consider the oil to be the oil of conversion But the wise took oil of conversion in their vessels with their lamps of testimony While the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept And at midnight there was a cry made Behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps of testimony And the foolish said unto the wise Give us of your oil even the oil of conversion for our lamps of testimony are weak and are gone out But the wise answered saying Not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves Matthew 25 4 9 Were the five wise virgins selfish and unwilling to share or were they indicating correctly that the oil of conversion cannot be borrowed Can the spiritual strength that results from consistent obedience to the commandments be given to another person Can the knowledge obtained through diligent study and pondering of the scriptures be conveyed to one who is in need Can the peace the gospel brings to a faithful Latter day Saint be transferred to an individual experiencing adversity or great challenge The clear answer to each of these questions is no As the wise virgins emphasized properly each of us must buy for ourselves These inspired women were not describing a business transaction rather they were emphasizing our individual responsibility to keep our lamp of testimony burning and to obtain an ample supply of the oil of conversion This precious oil is acquired one drop at a time line upon line and precept upon precept 2 Nephi 28 30 patiently and persistently No shortcut is available no last minute flurry of preparation is possible Wherefore be faithful praying always having your lamps trimmed and burning and oil with you that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom D C 33 17 TestimonyI promise that as we come to a knowledge of the truth and are converted unto the Lord we will remain firm and steadfast and never fall away Eagerly we will set aside our weapons of rebellion We will be blessed with bright light from our lamps of testimony and an ample supply of the oil of conversion And as each of us becomes more fully converted we will strengthen our families our friends and our associates Of these truths I testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brethren I am grateful we can worship together as a vast body of priesthood holders I love and admire you for your worthiness and your influence for good throughout the world I invite each of you to consider how you would respond to the following question posed to the members of the Church many years ago by President David O McKay If at this moment each one of you were asked to state in one sentence or phrase the most distinguishing feature of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints what would be your answer The Mission of the Church and Its Members Improvement Era Nov 1956 781 The response President McKay gave to his own question was the divine authority of the priesthood The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints stands apart from other churches that claim their authority is derived from historical succession the scriptures or theological training We make the distinctive declaration that priesthood authority has been conferred by the laying on of hands directly from heavenly messengers to the Prophet Joseph Smith My message focuses upon this divine priesthood and the powers of heaven I earnestly pray for the assistance of the Spirit of the Lord as together we learn about these important truths Priesthood Authority and PowerThe priesthood is the authority of God delegated to men on the earth to act in all things for the salvation of mankind see Spencer W Kimball The Example of Abraham Ensign June 1975 3 Priesthood is the means whereby the Lord acts through men to save souls One of the defining features of the Church of Jesus Christ both anciently and today is His authority There can be no true Church without divine authority Ordinary men are given the authority of the priesthood Worthiness and willingness not experience expertise or education are the qualifications for priesthood ordination The pattern for obtaining priesthood authority is described in the fifth article of faith We believe that a man must be called of God by prophecy and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof Thus a boy or a man receives the authority of the priesthood and is ordained to a specific office by one who already holds the priesthood and has been authorized by a leader with the necessary priesthood keys A priesthood holder is expected to exercise this sacred authority in accordance with God s holy mind will and purposes Nothing about the priesthood is self centered The priesthood always is used to serve to bless and to strengthen other people The higher priesthood is received by a solemn covenant that includes the obligation to act in the authority see D C 68 8 and the office see D C 107 99 that have been received As bearers of God s holy authority we are agents to act and not objects to be acted upon see 2 Nephi 2 26 The priesthood is inherently active rather than passive President Ezra Taft Benson taught It is not enough to receive the priesthood and then sit back passively and wait until someone prods us into activity When we receive the priesthood we have the obligation of becoming actively and anxiously engaged in promoting the cause of righteousness in the earth because the Lord says He that doeth not anything until he is commanded and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart and keepeth it with slothfulness the same is damned D C 58 29 So Shall Ye Reap 1960 21 President Spencer W Kimball also pointedly emphasized the active nature of the priesthood One breaks the priesthood covenant by transgressing commandments but also by leaving undone his duties Accordingly to break this covenant one needs only to do nothing The Miracle of Forgiveness 1969 96 As we do our best to fulfill our priesthood responsibilities we can be blessed with priesthood power The power of the priesthood is God s power operating through men and boys like us and requires personal righteousness faithfulness obedience and diligence A boy or a man may receive priesthood authority by the laying on of hands but will have no priesthood power if he is disobedient unworthy or unwilling to serve The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven and the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness That they may be conferred upon us it is true but when we undertake to cover our sins or to gratify our pride our vain ambition or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men in any degree of unrighteousness behold the heavens withdraw themselves the Spirit of the Lord is grieved and when it is withdrawn Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man D C 121 36 37 emphasis added Brethren for a boy or a man to receive priesthood authority but neglect to do what is necessary to qualify for priesthood power is unacceptable to the Lord Priesthood holders young and old need both authority and power the necessary permission and the spiritual capacity to represent God in the work of salvation A Lesson from My FatherI was reared in a home with a faithful mother and a wonderful father My mom was a descendant of pioneers who sacrificed everything for the Church and kingdom of God My dad was not a member of our Church and as a young man had desired to become a Catholic priest Ultimately he elected not to attend theological seminary and instead pursued a career as a tool and die maker For much of his married life my father attended meetings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints with our family In fact many of the people in our ward had no idea that my dad was not a member of the Church He played on and coached our ward softball team helped with Scout activities and supported my mother in her various callings and responsibilities I want to tell you about one of the great lessons I learned from my father about priesthood authority and power As a boy I asked my dad many times each week when he was going to be baptized He responded lovingly but firmly each time I pestered him David I am not going to join the Church for your mother for you or for anyone else I will join the Church when I know it is the right thing to do I believe I was in my early teenage years when the following conversation occurred with my father We had just returned home from attending our Sunday meetings together and I asked my dad when he was going to be baptized He smiled and said You are the one always asking me about being baptized Today I have a question for you I quickly and excitedly concluded that now we were making progress My dad continued David your church teaches that the priesthood was taken from the earth anciently and has been restored by heavenly messengers to the Prophet Joseph Smith right I replied that his statement was correct Then he said Here is my question Each week in priesthood meeting I listen to the bishop and the other priesthood leaders remind beg and plead with the men to do their home teaching and to perform their priesthood duties If your church truly has the restored priesthood of God why are so many of the men in your church no different about doing their religious duty than the men in my church My young mind immediately went completely blank I had no adequate answer for my dad I believe my father was wrong to judge the validity of our Church s claim to divine authority by the shortcomings of the men with whom he associated in our ward But embedded in his question to me was a correct assumption that men who bear God s holy priesthood should be different from other men Men who hold the priesthood are not inherently better than other men but they should act differently Men who hold the priesthood should not only receive priesthood authority but also become worthy and faithful conduits of God s power Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord D C 38 42 I have never forgotten the lessons about priesthood authority and power I learned from my father a good man not of our faith who expected more from men who claimed to bear God s priesthood That Sunday afternoon conversation with my dad many years ago produced in me a desire to be a good boy I did not want to be a poor example and a stumbling block to my father s progress in learning about the restored gospel I simply wanted to be a good boy The Lord needs all of us as bearers of His authority to be honorable virtuous and good boys at all times and in all places You may be interested to know that a number of years later my father was baptized And at the appropriate times I had the opportunity to confer upon him the Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthoods One of the great experiences of my life was observing my dad receive the authority and ultimately the power of the priesthood I share with you this pointed lesson I learned from my father to emphasize a simple truth Receiving the authority of the priesthood by the laying on of hands is an important beginning but it is not enough Ordination confers authority but righteousness is required to act with power as we strive to lift souls to teach and testify to bless and counsel and to advance the work of salvation In this momentous season of the earth s history you and I as bearers of the priesthood need to be righteous men and effective instruments in the hands of God We need to rise up as men of God You and I would do well to learn from and heed the example of Nephi the grandson of Helaman and the first of the twelve disciples called by the Savior at the beginning of His ministry among the Nephites And Nephi did minister many things unto them And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority 3 Nephi 7 17 Please Help My Husband Understand At the conclusion of the temple recommend interviews I conducted as a bishop and stake president I often would ask the married sisters how I could best serve them and their families The consistency of the answers I received from those faithful women was both instructive and alarming The sisters rarely complained or criticized but they often responded as follows Please help my husband understand his responsibility as a priesthood leader in our home I am happy to take the lead in scripture study family prayer and family home evening and I will continue to do so But I wish my husband would be an equal partner and provide the strong priesthood leadership only he can give Please help my husband learn how to become a patriarch and a priesthood leader in our home who presides and protects I reflect often on the sincerity of those sisters and their request Priesthood leaders hear similar concerns today Many wives are pleading for husbands who have not only priesthood authority but also priesthood power They yearn to be equally yoked with a faithful husband and priesthood companion in the work of creating a Christ centered and gospel focused home Brethren I promise that if you and I will prayerfully ponder the pleas of these sisters the Holy Ghost will help us to see ourselves as we really are see D C 93 24 and help us recognize the things we need to change and improve And the time to act is now Be Examples of RighteousnessTonight I reiterate the teachings of President Thomas S Monson who has invited us as priesthood holders to be examples of righteousness He has reminded us repeatedly that we are on the Lord s errand and are entitled to His help predicated upon our worthiness see Examples of Righteousness Liahona and Ensign May 2008 65 68 You and I hold priesthood authority that has been returned to the earth in this dispensation by heavenly messengers even John the Baptist and Peter James and John And therefore every man who receives the Melchizedek Priesthood can trace his personal line of authority directly to the Lord Jesus Christ I hope we are grateful for this marvelous blessing I pray we will be clean and worthy to represent the Lord as we exercise His sacred authority May each of us qualify for priesthood power I testify the holy priesthood indeed has been restored to the earth in these latter days and is found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I also witness that President Thomas S Monson is the presiding high priest over the high priesthood of the Church see D C 107 9 22 65 66 91 92 and the only person upon the earth who both holds and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys Of these truths I solemnly testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
As we study learn and live the gospel of Jesus Christ sequence often is instructive Consider for example the lessons we learn about spiritual priorities from the order of the major events that occurred as the fulness of the Savior s gospel was restored in these latter days In the Sacred Grove Joseph Smith saw and talked with the Eternal Father and Jesus Christ Among other things Joseph learned about the true nature of the Godhead and of continuing revelation This majestic vision ushered in the dispensation of the fulness of times Ephesians 1 10 and is one of the signal events in the history of the world Approximately three years later in response to earnest prayer on the evening of September 21 1823 Joseph s bedroom filled with light until it was lighter than at noonday Joseph Smith History 1 30 A personage appeared at his bedside called the young boy by name and declared he was a messenger sent from the presence of God and that his name was Moroni verse 33 He instructed Joseph about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon And then Moroni quoted from the book of Malachi in the Old Testament with a little variation in the language used in the King James Version Behold I will reveal unto you the Priesthood by the hand of Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers If it were not so the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming verses 38 39 Moroni s instructions to the young prophet ultimately included two primary themes 1 the Book of Mormon and 2 the words of Malachi foretelling the role of Elijah in the Restoration of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began Acts 3 21 Thus the introductory events of the Restoration revealed a correct understanding of the Godhead emphasized the importance of the Book of Mormon and anticipated the work of salvation and exaltation for both the living and the dead This inspiring sequence is instructive about the spiritual matters of highest priority to Deity My message focuses upon the ministry and Spirit of Elijah foretold by Moroni in his initial instructions to Joseph Smith I earnestly pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost The Ministry of ElijahElijah was an Old Testament prophet through whom mighty miracles were performed He sealed the heavens and no rain fell in ancient Israel for 3 years He multiplied a widow s meal and oil He raised a young boy from the dead and he called down fire from heaven in a challenge to the prophets of Baal See 1 Kings 17 18 At the conclusion of Elijah s mortal ministry he went up by a whirlwind into heaven 2 Kings 2 11 and was translated We learn from latter day revelation that Elijah held the sealing power of the Melchizedek Priesthood and was the last prophet to do so before the time of Jesus Christ Bible Dictionary Elijah The Prophet Joseph Smith explained The spirit power and calling of Elijah is that ye have power to hold the key of the fullness of the Melchizedek Priesthood and to obtain all the ordinances belonging to the kingdom of God Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 311 emphasis added This sacred sealing authority is essential for priesthood ordinances to be valid and binding both on earth and in heaven Elijah appeared with Moses on the Mount of Transfiguration see Matthew 17 3 and conferred this authority upon Peter James and John Elijah appeared again with Moses and others on April 3 1836 in the Kirtland Temple and conferred the same keys upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery Scripture records that Elijah the prophet stood before Joseph and Oliver and said Behold the time has fully come which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi testifying that he Elijah should be sent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near even at the doors D C 110 14 16 The restoration of the sealing authority by Elijah in 1836 was necessary to prepare the world for the Savior s Second Coming and initiated a greatly increased and worldwide interest in family history research The Spirit and Work of ElijahThe Prophet Joseph Smith declared The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead For it is necessary that the sealing power should be in our hands to seal our children and our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times a dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world for the salvation of man Hence God said I will send you Elijah the prophet Teachings Joseph Smith 475 Joseph further explained But what is the object of the coming of Elijah or how is it to be fulfilled The keys are to be delivered the spirit of Elijah is to come the Gospel to be established the Saints of God gathered Zion built up and the Saints to come up as saviors on Mount Zion see Obadiah 1 21 But how are they to become saviors on Mount Zion By building their temples and going forth and receiving all the ordinances in behalf of all their progenitors who are dead and herein is the chain that binds the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers which fulfills the mission of Elijah Teachings Joseph Smith 472 73 Elder Russell M Nelson has taught that the Spirit of Elijah is a manifestation of the Holy Ghost bearing witness of the divine nature of the family A New Harvest Time Ensign May 1998 34 This distinctive influence of the Holy Ghost draws people to identify document and cherish their ancestors and family members both past and present The Spirit of Elijah affects people inside and outside of the Church However as members of Christ s restored Church we have the covenant responsibility to search out our ancestors and provide for them the saving ordinances of the gospel They without us should not be made perfect Hebrews 11 40 see also Teachings Joseph Smith 475 And neither can we without our dead be made perfect D C 128 15 For these reasons we do family history research build temples and perform vicarious ordinances For these reasons Elijah was sent to restore the sealing authority that binds on earth and in heaven We are the Lord s agents in the work of salvation and exaltation that will prevent the whole earth from being smitten with a curse D C 110 15 when He returns again This is our duty and great blessing An Invitation to the Rising GenerationI now invite the attention of the young women young men and children of the rising generation as I emphasize the importance of the Spirit of Elijah in your lives today My message is intended for the entire Church in general but for you in particular Many of you may think family history work is to be performed primarily by older people But I know of no age limit described in the scriptures or guidelines announced by Church leaders restricting this important service to mature adults You are sons and daughters of God children of the covenant and builders of the kingdom You need not wait until you reach an arbitrary age to fulfill your responsibility to assist in the work of salvation for the human family The Lord has made available in our day remarkable resources that enable you to learn about and love this work that is sparked by the Spirit of Elijah For example FamilySearch is a collection of records resources and services easily accessible with personal computers and a variety of handheld devices designed to help people discover and document their family history These resources also are available in the family history centers located in many of our Church buildings throughout the world It is no coincidence that FamilySearch and other tools have come forth at a time when young people are so familiar with a wide range of information and communication technologies Your fingers have been trained to text and tweet to accelerate and advance the work of the Lord not just to communicate quickly with your friends The skills and aptitude evident among many young people today are a preparation to contribute to the work of salvation I invite the young people of the Church to learn about and experience the Spirit of Elijah I encourage you to study to search out your ancestors and to prepare yourselves to perform proxy baptisms in the house of the Lord for your kindred dead see D C 124 28 36 And I urge you to help other people identify their family histories As you respond in faith to this invitation your hearts shall turn to the fathers The promises made to Abraham Isaac and Jacob will be implanted in your hearts Your patriarchal blessing with its declaration of lineage will link you to these fathers and be more meaningful to you Your love and gratitude for your ancestors will increase Your testimony of and conversion to the Savior will become deep and abiding And I promise you will be protected against the intensifying influence of the adversary As you participate in and love this holy work you will be safeguarded in your youth and throughout your lives Parents and leaders please help your children and youth to learn about and experience the Spirit of Elijah But do not overly program this endeavor or provide too much detailed information or training Invite young people to explore to experiment and to learn for themselves see Joseph Smith History 1 20 Any young person can do what I am suggesting using the modules available at lds org familyhistoryyouth Aaronic Priesthood quorum and Young Women class presidencies can play an important role in helping all youth become acquainted with these basic resources Young people increasingly need to be learners who act and thereby receive additional light and knowledge by the power of the Holy Ghost and not merely passive students who primarily are acted upon see 2 Nephi 2 26 Parents and leaders you will stand all amazed at how rapidly your children and the youth of the Church become highly skilled with these tools In fact you will learn valuable lessons from these young people about effectively using these resources The youth can offer much to older individuals who are uncomfortable with or intimidated by technology or are unfamiliar with FamilySearch You also will count your many blessings as young people devote more time to family history work and temple service and less time to video games surfing the Internet and Facebooking Troy Jackson Jaren Hope and Andrew Allan are bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood who were called by an inspired bishop to team teach a family history class in their ward These young men are representative of so many of you in their eagerness to learn and desire to serve Troy stated I used to come to church and just sit there but now I realize that I need to go home and do something We can all do family history Jaren reported that as he learned more about family history he realized that these were not just names but real people I became more and more excited about taking the names to the temple And Andrew commented I have taken to family history with a love and vigor I did not know I could muster As I prepared each week to teach I was often nudged by the Holy Spirit to act and try some of the methods taught in the lesson Before family history was a scary thing But aided by the Spirit I was able to step up to my calling and help many people in our ward My beloved young brothers and sisters family history is not simply an interesting program or activity sponsored by the Church rather it is a vital part of the work of salvation and exaltation You have been prepared for this day and to build up the kingdom of God You are here upon the earth now to assist in this glorious work I testify Elijah returned to the earth and restored the sacred sealing authority I witness that what is bound on earth can be bound in heaven And I know the youth of the rising generation have a key role to play in this great endeavor I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
I express gratitude for the inspiration that attended the selection of the hymn that will follow my remarks Have I Done Any Good Hymns no 223 I get the hint I invite you to consider two experiences most of us have had with light The first experience occurred as we entered a dark room and turned on a light switch Remember how in an instant a bright flood of illumination filled the room and caused the darkness to disappear What previously had been unseen and uncertain became clear and recognizable This experience was characterized by immediate and intense recognition of light The second experience took place as we watched night turn into morning Do you recall the slow and almost imperceptible increase in light on the horizon In contrast to turning on a light in a dark room the light from the rising sun did not immediately burst forth Rather gradually and steadily the intensity of the light increased and the darkness of night was replaced by the radiance of morning Eventually the sun did dawn over the skyline But the visual evidence of the sun s impending arrival was apparent hours before the sun actually appeared over the horizon This experience was characterized by subtle and gradual discernment of light From these two ordinary experiences with light we can learn much about the spirit of revelation I pray the Holy Ghost will inspire and instruct us as we now focus upon the spirit of revelation and basic patterns whereby revelation is received The Spirit of RevelationRevelation is communication from God to His children on the earth and one of the great blessings associated with the gift and constant companionship of the Holy Ghost The Prophet Joseph Smith taught The Holy Ghost is a revelator and no man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 132 The spirit of revelation is available to every person who receives by proper priesthood authority the saving ordinances of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and who is acting in faith to fulfill the priesthood injunction to receive the Holy Ghost This blessing is not restricted to the presiding authorities of the Church rather it belongs to and should be operative in the life of every man woman and child who reaches the age of accountability and enters into sacred covenants Sincere desire and worthiness invite the spirit of revelation into our lives Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery gained valuable experience with the spirit of revelation as they translated the Book of Mormon These brethren learned they could receive whatever knowledge was necessary to complete their work if they asked in faith with an honest heart believing they would receive And over time they increasingly understood the spirit of revelation typically functions as thoughts and feelings that come into our minds and hearts by the power of the Holy Ghost See D C 8 1 2 100 5 8 As the Lord instructed them Now behold this is the spirit of revelation behold this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground Therefore this is thy gift apply unto it D C 8 3 4 I emphasize the phrase apply unto it in relation to the spirit of revelation In the scriptures the influence of the Holy Ghost frequently is described as a still small voice 1 Kings 19 12 1 Nephi 17 45 see also 3 Nephi 11 3 and a voice of perfect mildness Helaman 5 30 Because the Spirit whispers to us gently and delicately it is easy to understand why we should shun inappropriate media pornography and harmful addictive substances and behaviors These tools of the adversary can impair and eventually destroy our capacity to recognize and respond to the subtle messages from God delivered by the power of His Spirit Each of us should consider seriously and ponder prayerfully how we can reject the devil s enticements and righteously apply unto it even the spirit of revelation in our personal lives and families Patterns of RevelationRevelations are conveyed in a variety of ways including for example dreams visions conversations with heavenly messengers and inspiration Some revelations are received immediately and intensely some are recognized gradually and subtly The two experiences with light I described help us to better understand these two basic patterns of revelation A light turned on in a dark room is like receiving a message from God quickly completely and all at once Many of us have experienced this pattern of revelation as we have been given answers to sincere prayers or been provided with needed direction or protection according to God s will and timing Descriptions of such immediate and intense manifestations are found in the scriptures recounted in Church history and evidenced in our own lives Indeed these mighty miracles do occur However this pattern of revelation tends to be more rare than common The gradual increase of light radiating from the rising sun is like receiving a message from God line upon line precept upon precept 2 Nephi 28 30 Most frequently revelation comes in small increments over time and is granted according to our desire worthiness and preparation Such communications from Heavenly Father gradually and gently distil upon our souls as the dews from heaven D C 121 45 This pattern of revelation tends to be more common than rare and is evident in the experiences of Nephi as he tried several different approaches before successfully obtaining the plates of brass from Laban see 1 Nephi 3 4 Ultimately he was led by the Spirit to Jerusalem not knowing beforehand the things which he should do 1 Nephi 4 6 And he did not learn how to build a ship of curious workmanship all at one time rather Nephi was shown by the Lord from time to time after what manner he should work the timbers of the ship 1 Nephi 18 1 Both the history of the Church and our personal lives are replete with examples of the Lord s pattern for receiving revelation line upon line precept upon precept For example the fundamental truths of the restored gospel were not delivered to the Prophet Joseph Smith all at once in the Sacred Grove These priceless treasures were revealed as circumstances warranted and as the timing was right President Joseph F Smith explained how this pattern of revelation occurred in his life As a boy I would frequently ask the Lord to show me some marvelous thing in order that I might receive a testimony But the Lord withheld marvels from me and showed me the truth line upon line until He made me to know the truth from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet and until doubt and fear had been absolutely purged from me He did not have to send an angel from the heavens to do this nor did He have to speak with the trump of an archangel By the whisperings of the still small voice of the spirit of the living God He gave to me the testimony I possess And by this principle and power He will give to all the children of men a knowledge of the truth that will stay with them and it will make them to know the truth as God knows it and to do the will of the Father as Christ does it And no amount of marvelous manifestations will ever accomplish this in Conference Report Apr 1900 40 41 We as members of the Church tend to emphasize marvelous and dramatic spiritual manifestations so much that we may fail to appreciate and may even overlook the customary pattern by which the Holy Ghost accomplishes His work The very simpleness of the way 1 Nephi 17 41 of receiving small and incremental spiritual impressions that over time and in totality constitute a desired answer or the direction we need may cause us to look beyond the mark Jacob 4 14 I have talked with many individuals who question the strength of their personal testimony and underestimate their spiritual capacity because they do not receive frequent miraculous or strong impressions Perhaps as we consider the experiences of Joseph in the Sacred Grove of Saul on the road to Damascus and of Alma the Younger we come to believe something is wrong with or lacking in us if we fall short in our lives of these well known and spiritually striking examples If you have had similar thoughts or doubts please know that you are quite normal Just keep pressing forward obediently and with faith in the Savior As you do so you cannot go amiss D C 80 3 President Joseph F Smith counseled Show me Latter day Saints who have to feed upon miracles signs and visions in order to keep them steadfast in the Church and I will show you members who are not in good standing before God and who are walking in slippery paths It is not by marvelous manifestations unto us that we shall be established in the truth but it is by humility and faithful obedience to the commandments and laws of God in Conference Report Apr 1900 40 Another common experience with light helps us learn an additional truth about the line upon line precept upon precept pattern of revelation Sometimes the sun rises on a morning that is cloudy or foggy Because of the overcast conditions perceiving the light is more difficult and identifying the precise moment when the sun rises over the horizon is not possible But on such a morning we nonetheless have sufficient light to recognize a new day and to conduct our affairs In a similar way we many times receive revelation without recognizing precisely how or when we are receiving revelation An important episode from Church history illustrates this principle In the spring of 1829 Oliver Cowdery was a schoolteacher in Palmyra New York As he learned about Joseph Smith and the work of translating the Book of Mormon Oliver felt impressed to offer his assistance to the young prophet Consequently he traveled to Harmony Pennsylvania and became Joseph s scribe The timing of his arrival and the help he provided were vital to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon The Savior subsequently revealed to Oliver that as often as he had prayed for guidance he had received direction from the Spirit of the Lord If it had not been so the Lord declared thou wouldst not have come to the place where thou art at this time Behold thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth D C 6 14 15 Thus Oliver received a revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith informing him that he had been receiving revelation Apparently Oliver had not recognized how and when he had been receiving direction from God and needed this instruction to increase his understanding about the spirit of revelation In essence Oliver had been walking in the light as the sun was rising on a cloudy morning In many of the uncertainties and challenges we encounter in our lives God requires us to do our best to act and not be acted upon see 2 Nephi 2 26 and to trust in Him We may not see angels hear heavenly voices or receive overwhelming spiritual impressions We frequently may press forward hoping and praying but without absolute assurance that we are acting in accordance with God s will But as we honor our covenants and keep the commandments as we strive ever more consistently to do good and to become better we can walk with the confidence that God will guide our steps And we can speak with the assurance that God will inspire our utterances This is in part the meaning of the scripture that declares Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God D C 121 45 As you appropriately seek for and apply unto the spirit of revelation I promise you will walk in the light of the Lord Isaiah 2 5 2 Nephi 12 5 Sometimes the spirit of revelation will operate immediately and intensely other times subtly and gradually and often so delicately you may not even consciously recognize it But regardless of the pattern whereby this blessing is received the light it provides will illuminate and enlarge your soul enlighten your understanding see Alma 5 7 32 28 and direct and protect you and your family I declare my apostolic witness that the Father and the Son live The spirit of revelation is real and can and does function in our individual lives and in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I testify of these truths in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My message focuses on the importance of striving in our daily lives to actually receive the Holy Ghost I pray for and invite the Spirit of the Lord to instruct and edify each of us The Gift of the Holy GhostIn December of 1839 while in Washington D C to seek redress for the wrongs done to the Missouri Saints Joseph Smith and Elias Higbee wrote to Hyrum Smith In our interview with the President of the United States he interrogated us wherein we differed in our religion from the other religions of the day Brother Joseph said we differed in mode of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands We considered that all other considerations were contained in the gift of the Holy Ghost Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 97 The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead He is a personage of spirit and bears witness of all truth In the scriptures the Holy Ghost is referred to as the Comforter see John 14 16 27 Moroni 8 26 a teacher see John 14 26 D C 50 14 and a revelator see 2 Nephi 32 5 Revelations from the Father and the Son are conveyed through the Holy Ghost He is the messenger for and the witness of the Father and the Son The Holy Ghost is manifested to men and women on the earth both as the power and as the gift of the Holy Ghost The power can come upon a person before baptism it is the convincing witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer Through the power of the Holy Ghost sincere investigators can acquire a conviction of the truthfulness of the Savior s gospel of the Book of Mormon of the reality of the Restoration and of the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith The gift of the Holy Ghost is bestowed only after proper and authorized baptism and by the laying on of hands by those holding the Melchizedek Priesthood The Lord declared Yea repent and be baptized every one of you for a remission of your sins yea be baptized even by water and then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost And whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church by the laying on of the hands and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them D C 33 11 15 The Apostle Paul made this practice clear to the Ephesians when he asked Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed And they said unto him We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost And he said unto them Unto what then were ye baptized And they said Unto John s baptism Then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus When they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus And when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them Acts 19 2 6 Baptism by immersion is the introductory ordinance of the gospel and must be followed by baptism of the Spirit in order to be complete Bible Dictionary Baptism The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that baptism is a holy ordinance preparatory to the reception of the Holy Ghost it is the channel and key by which the Holy Ghost will be administered The Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands cannot be received through the medium of any other principle than the principle of righteousness Teachings Joseph Smith 95 96 The ordinance of confirming a new member of the Church and bestowing the gift of the Holy Ghost is both simple and profound Worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders place their hands upon the head of an individual and call him or her by name Then by the authority of the holy priesthood and in the name of the Savior the individual is confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and this important phrase is uttered Receive the Holy Ghost The simplicity of this ordinance may cause us to overlook its significance These four words Receive the Holy Ghost are not a passive pronouncement rather they constitute a priesthood injunction an authoritative admonition to act and not simply to be acted upon see 2 Nephi 2 26 The Holy Ghost does not become operative in our lives merely because hands are placed upon our heads and those four important words are spoken As we receive this ordinance each of us accepts a sacred and ongoing responsibility to desire to seek to work and to so live that we indeed receive the Holy Ghost and its attendant spiritual gifts For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him and he receive not the gift Behold he rejoices not in that which is given unto him neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift D C 88 33 What should we do to make this authorized admonition to seek for the companionship of the third member of the Godhead an ongoing reality Let me suggest that we need to 1 sincerely desire to receive the Holy Ghost 2 appropriately invite the Holy Ghost into our lives and 3 faithfully obey God s commandments Sincerely DesireWe first should desire yearn for and seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost You and I can learn a great lesson about righteous desires from the faithful disciples of the Master described in the Book of Mormon And the twelve did teach the multitude and behold they did cause that the multitude should kneel down upon the face of the earth and should pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus And they did pray for that which they most desired and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them 3 Nephi 19 6 9 Do we likewise remember to pray earnestly and consistently for that which we should most desire even the Holy Ghost Or do we become distracted by the cares of the world and the routine of daily living and take for granted or even neglect this most valuable of all gifts Receiving the Holy Ghost starts with our sincere and constant desire for His companionship in our lives Appropriately InviteWe more readily receive and recognize the Spirit of the Lord as we appropriately invite Him into our lives We cannot compel coerce or command the Holy Ghost Rather we should invite Him into our lives with the same gentleness and tenderness by which He entreats us see D C 42 14 Our invitations for the companionship of the Holy Ghost occur in many ways through the making and keeping of covenants by praying sincerely as individuals and families by searching the scriptures diligently through strengthening appropriate relationships with family members and friends by seeking after virtuous thoughts actions and language and by worshipping in our homes in the holy temple and at church Conversely casualness about or the breaking of covenants and commitments failing to pray and study the scriptures and inappropriate thoughts actions and language cause the Spirit to withdraw from or to avoid us altogether As King Benjamin taught his people And now I say unto you my brethren that after ye have known and have been taught all these things if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom s paths that ye may be blessed prospered and preserved Mosiah 2 36 Faithfully ObeyFaithfully obeying God s commandments is essential to receiving the Holy Ghost We are reminded of this truth each week as we listen to the sacrament prayers and worthily partake of the bread and water As we pledge our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ to always remember Him and to keep His commandments we are promised that we may always have His Spirit to be with us see D C 20 77 Thus everything the Savior s gospel teaches us to do and become is intended to bless us with the companionship of the Holy Ghost Consider the reasons we pray and study the scriptures Yes we yearn to communicate in prayer with Heavenly Father in the name of His Son And yes we desire to obtain the light and knowledge available in the standard works But please remember that these holy habits primarily are ways whereby we always remember Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son and are prerequisites to the ongoing companionship of the Holy Ghost Reflect on the reasons we worship in the house of the Lord and in our Sabbath meetings Yes we serve our kindred dead in the temple and our families and friends in the wards and branches in which we live And yes we enjoy the righteous sociality we find among our brothers and sisters But we primarily gather together in unity to seek the blessings of and instruction from the Holy Ghost Praying studying gathering worshipping serving and obeying are not isolated and independent items on a lengthy gospel checklist of things to do Rather each of these righteous practices is an important element in an overarching spiritual quest to fulfill the mandate to receive the Holy Ghost The commandments from God we obey and the inspired counsel from Church leaders we follow principally focus upon obtaining the companionship of the Spirit Fundamentally all gospel teachings and activities are centered on coming unto Christ by receiving the Holy Ghost in our lives You and I should strive to become like the stripling warriors described in the Book of Mormon who did perform every word of command with exactness yea and even according to their faith it was done unto them And they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day yea they do observe to keep his statutes and his judgments and his commandments continually Alma 57 21 58 40 TestimonyThe Lord has declared that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth D C 1 30 This restored Church is true because it is the Savior s Church He is the way the truth and the life John 14 6 And it is a living church because of the workings and gifts of the Holy Ghost How blessed we are to live at a time when the priesthood is upon the earth and we can receive the Holy Ghost Several years after the Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred he appeared to President Brigham Young and shared this timeless counsel Tell the people to be humble and faithful and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right Be careful and not turn away the small still voice it will teach you what to do and where to go it will yield the fruits of the kingdom Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them their hearts will be ready to receive it They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits It will whisper peace and joy to their souls and it will take malice hatred envying strife and all evil from their hearts and their whole desire will be to do good bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God Tell the brethren if they will follow the Spirit of the Lord they will go right Teachings Joseph Smith 98 I pray we will sincerely desire and appropriately invite the Holy Ghost into our daily lives I also pray each of us will faithfully obey God s commandments and in reality receive the Holy Ghost I promise the blessings described by the Prophet Joseph Smith to Brigham Young are applicable to and attainable by every individual who hears or reads this message I bear witness of the living reality of the Father and the Son I testify the Holy Ghost is a revelator a comforter and the ultimate teacher from whom we should learn And I witness that the blessings and gifts of the Spirit operate in the restored in the true and in the living Church of Jesus Christ in these latter days I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Recently I was driving my car as drops of rain from a thunderstorm began to fall on the windshield On the side of the road an electronic sign displayed a timely warning Standing Water Ahead The surface on which I was driving appeared to be quite safe But this vital information enabled me to prepare for a potential hazard I had not expected and could not yet see As I continued toward my destination I slowed down and watched carefully for additional signs of danger Early warning signals are evident in many aspects of our lives For example a fever can be a first symptom of sickness or disease Various financial and labor market indicators are used to forecast future trends in local and national economies And depending upon the area of the world in which we live we may receive flood avalanche hurricane tsunami tornado or winter storm warnings We also are blessed by spiritual early warning signals as a source of protection and direction in our lives Recall how Noah was alerted by God of things not yet seen and he prepared the ark to the saving of his house Hebrews 11 7 Lehi was warned to leave Jerusalem and take his family into the wilderness because the people to whom he had declared repentance sought to kill him see 1 Nephi 2 1 2 The Savior Himself was spared through an angelic warning Behold the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream saying Arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him Matthew 2 13 Consider the language of the Lord in the revelation known as the Word of Wisdom In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days I have warned you and forewarn you by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation D C 89 4 Spiritual warnings should lead to increasingly vigilant watching You and I live in a day of warning D C 63 58 And because we have been and will be warned we need to be as the Apostle Paul admonished watching with all perseverance Ephesians 6 18 I pray for the guidance of the Holy Ghost as I describe a spiritual early warning system that can help parents in Zion to be watchful and discerning concerning their children This early warning system applies to children of all ages and contains three basic components 1 reading and talking about the Book of Mormon with your children 2 bearing testimony of gospel truths spontaneously with your children and 3 inviting children as gospel learners to act and not merely be acted upon Parents who do these things faithfully will be blessed to recognize early signals of spiritual growth in or challenges with their children and be better prepared to receive inspiration to strengthen and help those children Component Number One Reading and Talking about the Book of MormonThe Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the Savior s gospel and is the only book the Lord Himself has testified to be true see D C 17 6 see also Russell M Nelson A Testimony of the Book of Mormon Liahona Jan 2000 84 Ensign Nov 1999 70 Indeed the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion The convincing and converting powers of the Book of Mormon come from both a central focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ and the inspired plainness and clarity of its teachings Nephi declared My soul delighteth in plainness unto my people that they may learn 2 Nephi 25 4 The root word plain in this verse does not refer to things that are ordinary or simple rather it denotes instruction that is clear and easily understood The Book of Mormon is the most correct of any book on earth because it centers upon the Truth see John 14 6 1 Nephi 13 40 even Jesus Christ and restores the plain and precious things that have been taken away from the true gospel see 1 Nephi 13 26 28 29 32 34 35 40 The unique combination of these two factors a focus on the Savior and the plainness of the teachings powerfully invites the confirming witness of the third member of the Godhead even the Holy Ghost Consequently the Book of Mormon speaks to the spirit and to the heart of the reader like no other volume of scripture The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that abiding by the precepts found in the Book of Mormon would help us get nearer to God than any other book Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 64 Regular reading of and talking about the Book of Mormon invite the power to resist temptation and to produce feelings of love within our families And discussions about the doctrines and principles in the Book of Mormon provide opportunities for parents to observe their children to listen to them to learn from them and to teach them Youth of all ages even infants can and do respond to the distinctive spirit of the Book of Mormon Children may not understand all of the words and stories but they certainly can feel the familiar spirit described by Isaiah Isaiah 29 4 see also 2 Nephi 26 16 And the questions a child asks the observations a child shares and the discussions that occur provide crucial spiritual early warning signals Importantly such conversations can help parents to discern what their children are learning thinking and feeling about the truths contained in this sacred volume of scripture as well as the difficulties they may be facing Component Number Two Bearing Testimony SpontaneouslyTestimony is personal knowledge based upon the witness of the Holy Ghost that certain facts of eternal significance are true The Holy Ghost is the messenger for the Father and the Son and the teacher of and guide to all truth see John 14 26 16 13 Thus by the power of the Holy Ghost we may know the truth of all things Moroni 10 5 The knowledge and spiritual conviction we receive from the Holy Ghost are the result of revelation Seeking for and obtaining these blessings require a sincere heart real intent and faith in Christ see Moroni 10 4 A personal testimony also brings responsibility and accountability Parents should be vigilant and spiritually attentive to spontaneously occurring opportunities to bear testimony to their children Such occasions need not be programmed scheduled or scripted In fact the less regimented such testimony sharing is the greater the likelihood for edification and lasting impact Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man D C 84 85 For example a naturally occurring family conversation at dinner may be the perfect setting for a parent to recount and testify of specific blessings he or she received during the course of relatively routine activities that day And a testimony need not always begin with the phrase I bear you my testimony Our witness can be declared as simply as I know I was blessed with inspiration at work today or The truth in this scripture always has been a powerful source of direction for me Similar opportunities to bear testimony also can arise while traveling together in a car or bus or in a multitude of other settings The reactions of children to such impromptu testimony bearing and their eagerness or reluctance to participate are potent sources of spiritual early warning signals A child s expression about a lesson learned in family scripture study or a candid statement of concern about a gospel principle or practice can be most illuminating and help parents better understand a child s specific question or needs Such discussions especially when parents are as eager to listen intently as they are to talk can foster a supportive and secure environment in the home and encourage ongoing communication about difficult topics Component Number Three Inviting Children to ActIn the grand division of all of God s creations there are things to act and things to be acted upon 2 Nephi 2 14 As children of our Heavenly Father we have been blessed with the gift of moral agency the capacity and power of independent action Endowed with agency we are agents and we primarily are to act and not merely be acted upon especially as we seek learning by study and also by faith D C 88 118 As gospel learners we should be doers of the word and not hearers only James 1 22 Our hearts are opened to the influence of the Holy Ghost as we properly exercise agency and act in accordance with correct principles and we thereby invite His teaching and testifying power Parents have the sacred responsibility to help children to act and to seek learning by faith And a child is never too young to take part in this pattern of learning Giving a man a fish feeds him for one meal Teaching a man to fish feeds him for a lifetime As parents and gospel instructors you and I are not in the business of distributing fish rather our work is to help our children learn to fish and to become spiritually steadfast This vital objective is best accomplished as we encourage our children to act in accordance with correct principles as we help them to learn by doing If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God John 7 17 Such learning requires spiritual mental and physical exertion and not just passive reception Inviting children as gospel learners to act and not merely be acted upon builds on reading and talking about the Book of Mormon and bearing testimony spontaneously in the home Imagine for example a family home evening in which children are invited and expected to come prepared to ask questions about what they are reading and learning in the Book of Mormon or about an issue that recently was emphasized in a gospel discussion or spontaneous testimony in the home And imagine further that the children ask questions the parents are not prepared adequately to answer Some parents might be apprehensive about such an unstructured approach to home evening But the best family home evenings are not necessarily the product of preprepared purchased or downloaded packets of outlines and visual aids What a glorious opportunity for family members to search the scriptures together and to be tutored by the Holy Ghost For the preacher was no better than the hearer neither was the teacher any better than the learner and they did all labor every man according to his strength Alma 1 26 Are you and I helping our children become agents who act and seek learning by study and by faith or have we trained our children to wait to be taught and acted upon Are we as parents primarily giving our children the equivalent of spiritual fish to eat or are we consistently helping them to act to learn for themselves and to stand steadfast and immovable Are we helping our children become anxiously engaged in asking seeking and knocking See 3 Nephi 14 7 The spiritual understanding you and I have been blessed to receive and which has been confirmed as true in our hearts simply cannot be given to our children The tuition of diligence and of learning by study and also by faith must be paid to obtain and personally own such knowledge Only in this way can what is known in the mind also be felt in the heart Only in this way can a child move beyond relying upon the spiritual knowledge and experiences of parents and adults and claim those blessings for himself or herself Only in this way can our children be prepared spiritually for the challenges of mortality Promise and TestimonyI bear witness that parents who consistently read and talk about the Book of Mormon with their children who share testimony spontaneously with their children and who invite children as gospel learners to act and not merely be acted upon will be blessed with eyes that can see afar off see Moses 6 27 and with ears that can hear the sound of the trumpet see Ezekiel 33 2 16 The spiritual discernment and inspiration you will receive from the combination of these three holy habits will enable you to stand as watchmen on the tower for your families watching with all perseverance Ephesians 6 18 to the blessing of your immediate family and your future posterity I so promise and testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
In 1833 the Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation that contained a strong rebuke to several leading brethren of the Church to set their families in order see D C 93 40 50 A specific phrase from this revelation provides the theme for my message more diligent and concerned at home verse 50 I want to suggest three ways each of us can become more diligent and concerned in our homes I invite you to listen both with ears that hear and with hearts that feel and I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to be with all of us Suggestion Number One Express Love and Show ItWe can begin to become more diligent and concerned at home by telling the people we love that we love them Such expressions do not need to be flowery or lengthy We simply should sincerely and frequently express love Brethren and sisters when was the last time you took your eternal companion in your arms and said I love you Parents when was the last time you sincerely expressed love to your children Children when was the last time you told your parents that you love them Each of us already knows we should tell the people we love that we love them But what we know is not always reflected in what we do We may feel unsure awkward or even perhaps a bit embarrassed As disciples of the Savior we are not merely striving to know more rather we need to consistently do more of what we know is right and become better We should remember that saying I love you is only a beginning We need to say it we need to mean it and most importantly we need consistently to show it We need to both express and demonstrate love President Thomas S Monson recently counseled Often we assume that the people around us must know how much we love them But we should never assume we should let them know We will never regret the kind words spoken or the affection shown Rather our regrets will come if such things are omitted from our relationships with those who mean the most to us Finding Joy in the Journey Liahona and Ensign Nov 2008 86 Sometimes in a sacrament meeting talk or testimony we hear a statement like this I know I do not tell my spouse often enough how much I love her Today I want her my children and all of you to know that I love her Such an expression of love may be appropriate But when I hear a statement like this I squirm and silently exclaim that the spouse and children should not be hearing this apparently rare and private communication in public at church Hopefully the children hear love expressed and see love demonstrated between their parents in the regular routine of daily living If however the public statement of love at church is a bit surprising to the spouse or the children then indeed there is a need to be more diligent and concerned at home The relationship between love and appropriate action is demonstrated repeatedly in the scriptures and is highlighted by the Savior s instruction to His Apostles If ye love me keep my commandments John 14 15 Just as our love of and for the Lord is evidenced by walking ever in His ways see Deuteronomy 19 9 so our love for spouse parents and children is reflected most powerfully in our thoughts our words and our deeds see Mosiah 4 30 Feeling the security and constancy of love from a spouse a parent or a child is a rich blessing Such love nurtures and sustains faith in God Such love is a source of strength and casts out fear see 1 John 4 18 Such love is the desire of every human soul We can become more diligent and concerned at home as we express love and consistently show it Suggestion Number Two Bear Testimony and Live ItWe also can become more diligent and concerned at home by bearing testimony to those whom we love about the things we know to be true by the witness of the Holy Ghost The bearing of testimony need not be lengthy or eloquent And we do not need to wait until the first Sunday of the month to declare our witness of things that are true Within the walls of our own homes we can and should bear pure testimony of the divinity and reality of the Father and the Son of the great plan of happiness and of the Restoration Brethren and sisters when was the last time you bore testimony to your eternal companion Parents when was the last time you declared your witness to your children about the things you know to be true And children when was the last time you shared your testimony with your parents and family Each of us already knows we should bear testimony to the people we love the most But what we know is not always reflected in what we do We may feel unsure awkward or even perhaps a bit embarrassed As disciples of the Savior we are not merely striving to know more rather we need to consistently do more of what we know is right and become better We should remember that bearing a heartfelt testimony is only a beginning We need to bear testimony we need to mean it and most importantly we need consistently to live it We need to both declare and live our testimonies The relationship between testimony and appropriate action is emphasized in the Savior s instruction to the Saints in Kirtland That which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do D C 46 7 Our testimony of gospel truth should be reflected both in our words and in our deeds And our testimonies are proclaimed and lived most powerfully in our own homes Spouses parents and children should strive to overcome any hesitancy reluctance or embarrassment about bearing testimony We should both create and look for opportunities to bear testimony of gospel truths and live them A testimony is what we know to be true in our minds and in our hearts by the witness of the Holy Ghost see D C 8 2 As we profess truth rather than admonish exhort or simply share interesting experiences we invite the Holy Ghost to confirm the verity of our words The power of pure testimony see Alma 4 19 does not come from sophisticated language or effective presentation rather it is the result of revelation conveyed by the third member of the Godhead even the Holy Ghost Feeling the power the edification and the constancy of testimony from a spouse a parent or a child is a rich blessing Such testimony fortifies faith and provides direction Such testimony generates light in a world that grows increasingly dark Such testimony is the source of an eternal perspective and of enduring peace We can become more diligent and concerned at home as we bear testimony and consistently live it Suggestion Number Three Be ConsistentAs our sons were growing up our family did what you have done and what you now do We had regular family prayer scripture study and family home evening Now I am sure what I am about to describe has never occurred in your home but it did in ours Sometimes Sister Bednar and I wondered if our efforts to do these spiritually essential things were worthwhile Now and then verses of scripture were read amid outbursts such as He s touching me Make him stop looking at me Mom he s breathing my air Sincere prayers occasionally were interrupted with giggling and poking And with active rambunctious boys family home evening lessons did not always produce high levels of edification At times Sister Bednar and I were exasperated because the righteous habits we worked so hard to foster did not seem to yield immediately the spiritual results we wanted and expected Today if you could ask our adult sons what they remember about family prayer scripture study and family home evening I believe I know how they would answer They likely would not identify a particular prayer or a specific instance of scripture study or an especially meaningful family home evening lesson as the defining moment in their spiritual development What they would say they remember is that as a family we were consistent Sister Bednar and I thought helping our sons understand the content of a particular lesson or a specific scripture was the ultimate outcome But such a result does not occur each time we study or pray or learn together The consistency of our intent and work was perhaps the greatest lesson a lesson we did not fully appreciate at the time In my office is a beautiful painting of a wheat field The painting is a vast collection of individual brushstrokes none of which in isolation is very interesting or impressive In fact if you stand close to the canvas all you can see is a mass of seemingly unrelated and unattractive streaks of yellow and gold and brown paint However as you gradually move away from the canvas all of the individual brushstrokes combine together and produce a magnificent landscape of a wheat field Many ordinary individual brushstrokes work together to create a captivating and beautiful painting Each family prayer each episode of family scripture study and each family home evening is a brushstroke on the canvas of our souls No one event may appear to be very impressive or memorable But just as the yellow and gold and brown strokes of paint complement each other and produce an impressive masterpiece so our consistency in doing seemingly small things can lead to significant spiritual results Wherefore be not weary in well doing for ye are laying the foundation of a great work And out of small things proceedeth that which is great D C 64 33 Consistency is a key principle as we lay the foundation of a great work in our individual lives and as we become more diligent and concerned in our own homes Being consistent in our homes is important for another reason Many of the Savior s harshest rebukes were directed to hypocrites Jesus warned His disciples concerning the scribes and Pharisees Do not ye after their works for they say and do not Matthew 23 3 This strong admonition is sobering given the counsel to express love and show it to bear testimony and live it and to be consistent The hypocrisy in our lives is most readily discerned and causes the greatest destruction within our own homes And children often are the most alert and sensitive when it comes to recognizing hypocrisy A public statement of love when the private actions of love are absent at home is hypocrisy and weakens the foundation of a great work Publicly declaring testimony when faithfulness and obedience are missing within our own homes is hypocrisy and undermines the foundation of a great work The commandment Thou shalt not bear false witness Exodus 20 16 applies most pointedly to the hypocrite in each of us We need to be and become more consistent But be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity 1 Timothy 4 12 As we seek the Lord s help and in His strength we can gradually reduce the disparity between what we say and what we do between expressing love and consistently showing it and between bearing testimony and steadfastly living it We can become more diligent and concerned at home as we are more faithful in learning living and loving the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Testimony Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and the family is central to the Creator s plan for the eternal destiny of His children The Family A Proclamation to the World Liahona Oct 2004 49 Ensign Nov 1995 102 For these and other eternally important reasons we should be more diligent and concerned at home May every spouse every child and every parent be blessed to communicate and receive love to bear and be edified by strong testimony and to become more consistent in the seemingly small things that matter so much In these important pursuits we will never be left alone Our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son live They love us and know our circumstances and They will help us to become more diligent and concerned at home Of these truths I testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Shortly after I was called to serve as a stake president in 1987 I talked with a good friend who recently had been released as a stake president During our conversation I asked him what he would teach me about becoming an effective stake president His answer to my question had a profound impact upon my subsequent service and ministry My friend indicated he had been called to serve as a temple worker soon after his release He then said I wish I had been a temple worker before I was a stake president If I had served in the temple before my call to serve as a stake president I would have been a very different stake president I was intrigued by his answer and asked him to explain further He responded I believe I was a good stake president The programs in our stake ran well and our statistics were above average But serving in the temple has expanded my vision If I were called today to serve as a stake president my primary focus would be on worthiness to receive and honor temple covenants I would strive to make temple preparation the center of all that we did I would do a better job of shepherding the Saints to the house of the Lord That brief conversation with my friend helped me as a stake president to teach relentlessly about and testify of the eternal importance of temple ordinances temple covenants and temple worship The deepest desire of our presidency was for every member of the stake to receive the blessings of the temple to be worthy of and to use frequently a temple recommend My message today focuses upon the blessings of the temple and I pray the Holy Ghost will illuminate our minds penetrate our hearts and bear witness of truth to each of us The Divine Purpose of GatheringThe Prophet Joseph Smith declared that in all ages the divine purpose of gathering the people of God is to build temples so His children can receive the highest ordinances and thereby gain eternal life see Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith Melchizedek Priesthood and Relief Society course of study 2007 415 17 This essential relationship between the principle of gathering and the building of temples is highlighted in the Book of Mormon Behold the field was ripe and blessed are ye for ye did thrust in the sickle and did reap with your might yea all the day long did ye labor and behold the number of your sheaves And they shall be gathered into the garners that they are not wasted Alma 26 5 The sheaves in this analogy represent newly baptized members of the Church The garners are the holy temples Elder Neal A Maxwell explained Clearly when we baptize our eyes should gaze beyond the baptismal font to the holy temple The great garner into which the sheaves should be gathered is the holy temple in John L Hart Make Calling Focus of Your Mission Church News Sept 17 1994 4 This instruction clarifies and emphasizes the importance of sacred temple ordinances and covenants that the sheaves may not be wasted Yea they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day yea neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place that the storm cannot penetrate to them yea neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them Alma 26 6 Elder Dallin H Oaks has explained that in renewing our baptismal covenants by partaking of the emblems of the sacrament we do not witness that we take upon us the name of Jesus Christ Rather we witness that we are willing to do so See D C 20 77 The fact that we only witness to our willingness suggests that something else must happen before we actually take that sacred name upon us in the ultimate and most important sense Taking upon Us the Name of Jesus Christ Ensign May 1985 81 The baptismal covenant clearly contemplates a future event or events and looks forward to the temple In modern revelations the Lord refers to temples as houses built unto my name D C 105 33 see also D C 109 2 5 124 39 In the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple the Prophet Joseph Smith petitioned the Father that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power and that thy name may be upon them D C 109 22 He also asked for a blessing over thy people upon whom thy name shall be put in this house v 26 And as the Lord appeared in and accepted the Kirtland Temple as His house He declared For behold I have accepted this house and my name shall be here and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house D C 110 7 These scriptures help us understand that the process of taking upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ that is commenced in the waters of baptism is continued and enlarged in the house of the Lord As we stand in the waters of baptism we look to the temple As we partake of the sacrament we look to the temple We pledge to always remember the Savior and to keep His commandments as preparation to participate in the sacred ordinances of the temple and receive the highest blessings available through the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ Thus in the ordinances of the holy temple we more completely and fully take upon us the name of Jesus Christ And this greater or Melchizedek priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom even the key of the knowledge of God Therefore in the ordinances thereof the power of godliness is manifest And without the ordinances thereof and the authority of the priesthood the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh D C 84 19 21 No Combination of Wickedness Shall Prevail over Thy PeopleWe live in a great day of temple building around the world And the adversary surely is mindful of the increasing number of temples that now dot the earth As always the building and dedicating of these sacred structures are accompanied by opposition from enemies of the Church as well as by ill advised criticism from some within the Church Such antagonism is not new In 1861 while the Salt Lake Temple was under construction Brigham Young encouraged the Saints If you wish this Temple built go to work and do all you can Some say I do not like to do it for we never began to build a Temple without the bells of hell beginning to ring I want to hear them ring again All the tribes of hell will be on the move but what do you think it will amount to You have all the time seen what it has amounted to Deseret News Apr 10 1861 41 We as faithful Saints have been strengthened by adversity and are the recipients of the Lord s tender mercies We have moved forward under the promise of the Lord I will not suffer that mine enemies shall destroy my work yea I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil D C 10 43 For many years Sister Bednar and I hosted faithful men and women as devotional speakers at Brigham Young University Idaho Many of these speakers were emeritus or released members of the Seventy who had served as temple presidents following their service as General Authorities As we talked with these stalwart leaders I always asked this question What have you learned as a temple president that you wish you had better understood when you were a General Authority As I listened to their answers I discovered a consistent theme that I would summarize as follows I have come to understand better the protection available through our temple covenants and what it means to make an acceptable offering of temple worship There is a difference between church attending tithe paying members who occasionally rush into the temple to go through a session and those members who faithfully and consistently worship in the temple The similarity of their answers impressed me greatly Each response to my question focused upon the protecting power of the ordinances and covenants available in the house of the Lord Their answers precisely paralleled the promises contained in the dedicatory prayer offered upon the Kirtland Temple in 1836 We ask thee Holy Father to establish the people that shall worship and honorably hold a name and standing in this thy house to all generations and for eternity That no weapon formed against them shall prosper that he who diggeth a pit for them shall fall into the same himself That no combination of wickedness shall have power to rise up and prevail over thy people upon whom thy name shall be put in this house And if any people shall rise against this people that thine anger be kindled against them And if they shall smite this people thou wilt smite them thou wilt fight for thy people as thou didst in the day of battle that they may be delivered from the hands of all their enemies D C 109 24 28 Please consider these verses in light of the current raging of the adversary and what we have discussed about our willingness to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and the blessing of protection promised to those who honorably hold a name and standing in the holy temple Significantly these covenant blessings are to all generations and for all eternity I invite you to study repeatedly and ponder prayerfully the implications of these scriptures in your life and for your family We should not be surprised by Satan s efforts to thwart or discredit temple worship and work The devil despises the purity in and the power of the Lord s house And the protection available to each of us in and through temple ordinances and covenants stands as a great obstacle to the evil designs of Lucifer The Fire of the CovenantThe exodus from Nauvoo in September of 1846 caused unimaginable hardship for the faithful Latter day Saints Many sought shelter in camps along the Mississippi River When word reached Brigham Young at Winter Quarters about the condition of these refugees he immediately sent a letter across the river to Council Point encouraging the brethren to help reminding them of the covenant made in the Nauvoo Temple He counseled Now is the time for labor Let the fire of the covenant which you made in the House of the Lord burn in your hearts like flame unquenchable in Journal History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Sept 28 1846 5 Within days wagons were rolling eastward to rescue the struggling Saints What was it that gave those early Saints such strength It was the fire of the temple covenant that burned in their hearts It was their commitment to worship and honorably hold a name and standing in the house of the Lord We do now and will yet face great challenges to the work of the Lord But like the pioneers who found the place which God for them prepared so we will fresh courage take knowing our God will never us forsake see Come Come Ye Saints Hymns no 30 Today temples dot the earth as sacred places of ordinances and covenants of edification and of refuge from the storm Invitations and CommendationThe Lord declared I must gather together my people that the wheat may be secured in the garners to possess eternal life and be crowned with celestial glory D C 101 65 Within the sound of my voice are many young women young men and children I plead with you to be worthy to be steadfast and to look forward with great anticipation to the day you will receive the ordinances and blessings of the temple Within the sound of my voice are individuals who should have but have not yet received the ordinances of the house of the Lord Whatever the reason however long the delay I invite you to begin making the spiritual preparations so you can receive the blessings available only in the holy temple Please cast away the things in your life that stand in the way Please seek after the things that are of eternal consequence Within the sound of my voice are individuals who have received the ordinances of the temple and for various reasons have not returned to the house of the Lord in quite some time Please repent prepare and do whatever needs to be done so you can again worship in the temple and more fully remember and honor your sacred covenants Within the sound of my voice are many individuals who hold current temple recommends and strive worthily to use them I commend you for your faithfulness and devotion I bear solemn witness that the fire of the covenant will burn in the heart of every faithful member of this Church who shall worship and honorably hold a name and standing in the Lord s holy house Jesus the Christ is our Redeemer and Savior He lives and He directs the affairs of His Church through revelation to His anointed servants Of these things I bear witness in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My message in the last general conference focused upon the gospel principle of asking in faith in prayer Today I want to discuss three additional principles that can help our prayers become more meaningful and I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost for me and for you Principle 1 Prayer becomes more meaningful as we counsel with the Lord in all our doings see Alma 37 37 Simply stated prayer is communication to Heavenly Father from His sons and daughters on earth As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God namely God is our Father and we are his children then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part Bible Dictionary Prayer 752 We are commanded to pray always to the Father in the name of the Son see 3 Nephi 18 19 20 We are promised that if we pray sincerely for that which is right and good and in accordance with God s will we can be blessed protected and directed see 3 Nephi 18 20 D C 19 38 Revelation is communication from Heavenly Father to His children on earth As we ask in faith we can receive revelation upon revelation and knowledge upon knowledge and come to know the mysteries and peaceable things that bring joy and eternal life see D C 42 61 The mysteries are those matters that can only be known and understood by the power of the Holy Ghost see Harold B Lee Ye Are the Light of the World 1974 211 The revelations of the Father and the Son are conveyed through the third member of the Godhead even the Holy Ghost The Holy Ghost is the witness of and messenger for the Father and the Son The patterns used by God in creating the earth are instructive in helping us understand how to make prayer meaningful In the third chapter of the book of Moses we learn that all things were created spiritually before they were naturally upon the earth And now behold I say unto you that these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created in the day that I the Lord God made the heaven and the earth And every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew For I the Lord God created all things of which I have spoken spiritually before they were naturally upon the face of the earth Moses 3 4 5 We learn from these verses that the spiritual creation preceded the temporal creation In a similar way meaningful morning prayer is an important element in the spiritual creation of each day and precedes the temporal creation or the actual execution of the day Just as the temporal creation was linked to and a continuation of the spiritual creation so meaningful morning and evening prayers are linked to and are a continuation of each other Consider this example There may be things in our character in our behavior or concerning our spiritual growth about which we need to counsel with Heavenly Father in morning prayer After expressing appropriate thanks for blessings received we plead for understanding direction and help to do the things we cannot do in our own strength alone For example as we pray we might Reflect on those occasions when we have spoken harshly or inappropriately to those we love the most Recognize that we know better than this but we do not always act in accordance with what we know Express remorse for our weaknesses and for not putting off the natural man more earnestly Determine to pattern our life after the Savior more completely Plead for greater strength to do and to become better Such a prayer is a key part of the spiritual preparation for our day During the course of the day we keep a prayer in our heart for continued assistance and guidance even as Alma suggested Let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord Alma 37 36 We notice during this particular day that there are occasions where normally we would have a tendency to speak harshly and we do not or we might be inclined to anger but we are not We discern heavenly help and strength and humbly recognize answers to our prayer Even in that moment of recognition we offer a silent prayer of gratitude At the end of our day we kneel again and report back to our Father We review the events of the day and express heartfelt thanks for the blessings and the help we received We repent and with the assistance of the Spirit of the Lord identify ways we can do and become better tomorrow Thus our evening prayer builds upon and is a continuation of our morning prayer And our evening prayer also is a preparation for meaningful morning prayer Morning and evening prayers and all of the prayers in between are not unrelated discrete events rather they are linked together each day and across days weeks months and even years This is in part how we fulfill the scriptural admonition to pray always Luke 21 36 3 Nephi 18 15 18 D C 31 12 Such meaningful prayers are instrumental in obtaining the highest blessings God holds in store for His faithful children Prayer becomes meaningful as we remember our relationship to Deity and heed the admonition to Cry unto God for all thy support yea let all thy doings be unto the Lord and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord yea let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord yea let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings and he will direct thee for good yea when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord that he may watch over you in your sleep and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God and if ye do these things ye shall be lifted up at the last day Alma 37 36 37 emphasis added Principle 2 Prayer becomes more meaningful as we express heartfelt gratitude During our service at Brigham Young University Idaho Sister Bednar and I frequently hosted General Authorities in our home Our family learned an important lesson about meaningful prayer as we knelt to pray one evening with a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Earlier in the day Sister Bednar and I had been informed about the unexpected death of a dear friend and our immediate desire was to pray for the surviving spouse and children As I invited my wife to offer the prayer the member of the Twelve unaware of the tragedy graciously suggested that in the prayer Sister Bednar express only appreciation for blessings received and ask for nothing His counsel was similar to Alma s instruction to the members of the ancient Church to pray without ceasing and to give thanks in all things Mosiah 26 39 Given the unexpected tragedy requesting blessings for our friends initially seemed to us more urgent than expressing thanks Sister Bednar responded in faith to the direction she received She thanked Heavenly Father for meaningful and memorable experiences with this dear friend She communicated sincere gratitude for the Holy Ghost as the Comforter and for the gifts of the Spirit that enable us to face adversity and to serve others Most importantly she expressed appreciation for the plan of salvation for the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ for His Resurrection and for the ordinances and covenants of the restored gospel which make it possible for families to be together forever Our family learned from that experience a great lesson about the power of thankfulness in meaningful prayer Because of and through that prayer our family was blessed with inspiration about a number of issues that were pressing upon our minds and stirring in our hearts We learned that our gratefulness for the plan of happiness and for the Savior s mission of salvation provided needed reassurance and strengthened our confidence that all would be well with our dear friends We also received insights concerning the things about which we should pray and appropriately ask in faith The most meaningful and spiritual prayers I have experienced contained many expressions of thanks and few if any requests As I am blessed now to pray with apostles and prophets I find among these modern day leaders of the Savior s Church the same characteristic that describes Captain Moroni in the Book of Mormon these are men whose hearts swell with thanksgiving to God for the many privileges and blessings which He bestows upon His people see Alma 48 12 Also they do not multiply many words for it is given unto them what they should pray and they are filled with desire see 3 Nephi 19 24 The prayers of prophets are childlike in their simplicity and powerful because of their sincerity As we strive to make our prayers more meaningful we should remember that in nothing doth man offend God or against none is his wrath kindled save those who confess not his hand in all things and obey not his commandments D C 59 21 Let me recommend that periodically you and I offer a prayer in which we only give thanks and express gratitude Ask for nothing simply let our souls rejoice and strive to communicate appreciation with all the energy of our hearts Principle 3 Prayer becomes more meaningful as we pray for others with real intent and a sincere heart Petitioning Heavenly Father for the blessings we desire in our personal lives is good and proper However praying earnestly for others both those whom we love and those who despitefully use us is also an important element of meaningful prayer Just as expressing gratitude more often in our prayers enlarges the conduit for revelation so praying for others with all of the energy of our souls increases our capacity to hear and to heed the voice of the Lord We learn a vital lesson from the example of Lehi in the Book of Mormon Lehi responded in faith to prophetic instruction and warnings concerning the destruction of Jerusalem He then prayed unto the Lord with all his heart in behalf of his people 1 Nephi 1 5 emphasis added In answer to this fervent prayer Lehi was blessed with a glorious vision of God and His Son and of the impending destruction of Jerusalem see 1 Nephi 1 6 9 13 18 Consequently Lehi rejoiced and his whole heart was filled because of the things which the Lord had shown him see 1 Nephi 1 15 Please note that the vision came in response to a prayer for others and not as a result of a request for personal edification or guidance The Savior is the perfect example of praying for others with real intent In His great Intercessory Prayer uttered on the night before His Crucifixion Jesus prayed for His Apostles and all of the Saints I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine Neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them John 17 9 20 26 During the Savior s ministry on the American continent He directed the people to ponder His teachings and to pray for understanding He healed the sick and He prayed for the people using language that could not be written see 3 Nephi 17 1 16 The impact of His prayer was profound No one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father 3 Nephi 17 17 Imagine what it might have been like to hear the Savior of the world praying for us Do our spouses children and other family members likewise feel the power of our prayers offered unto the Father for their specific needs and desires Do those we serve hear us pray for them with faith and sincerity If those we love and serve have not heard and felt the influence of our earnest prayers in their behalf then the time to repent is now As we emulate the example of the Savior our prayers truly will become more meaningful We are commanded to pray always 2 Nephi 32 9 D C 10 5 90 24 vocally as well as in our heart s before the world as well as in secret in public as well as in private D C 19 28 I testify that prayer becomes more meaningful as we counsel with the Lord in all of our doings as we express heartfelt gratitude and as we pray for others with real intent and a sincere heart I witness Heavenly Father lives and that He hears and answers every earnest prayer Jesus is the Christ our Savior and Mediator Revelation is real The fulness of the gospel has been restored to the earth in this dispensation I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
I invite the Holy Ghost to assist us as we consider a principle that can help our prayers become more meaningful the gospel principle of asking in faith I want to review three examples of asking in faith in meaningful prayer and discuss the lessons we can learn from each one of them As we speak of prayer I emphasize the word meaningful Simply saying prayers is quite a different thing from engaging in meaningful prayer I expect that all of us already know that prayer is essential for our spiritual development and protection But what we know is not always reflected in what we do And even though we recognize the importance of prayer all of us can improve the consistency and efficacy of our personal and family prayers Ask in Faith and ActThe classic example of asking in faith is Joseph Smith and the First Vision As young Joseph was seeking to know the truth about religion he read the following verses in the first chapter of James If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him But let him ask in faith nothing wavering James 1 5 6 Please notice the requirement to ask in faith which I understand to mean the necessity to not only express but to do the dual obligation to both plead and to perform the requirement to communicate and to act Pondering this biblical text led Joseph to retire to a grove of trees near his home to pray and to seek spiritual knowledge Note the questions that guided Joseph s thinking and supplicating In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions I often said to myself What is to be done Who of all these parties are right or are they all wrong together If any one of them be right which is it and how shall I know it My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right that I might know which to join Joseph Smith History 1 10 18 Joseph s questions focused not just on what he needed to know but also on what was to be done His prayer was not simply Which church is right His question was Which church should I join Joseph went to the grove to ask in faith and he was determined to act True faith is focused in and on the Lord Jesus Christ and always leads to righteous action The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that faith is the first principle in revealed religion and the foundation of all righteousness and that it is also the principle of action in all intelligent beings Lectures on Faith 1985 1 Action alone is not faith in the Savior but acting in accordance with correct principles is a central component of faith Thus faith without works is dead James 2 20 The Prophet Joseph further explained that faith is not only the principle of action but of power also in all intelligent beings whether in heaven or on earth Lectures on Faith 3 Thus faith in Christ leads to righteous action which increases our spiritual capacity and power Understanding that faith is a principle of action and of power inspires us to exercise our moral agency in compliance with gospel truth invites the redeeming and strengthening powers of the Savior s Atonement into our lives and enlarges the power within us whereby we are agents unto ourselves see D C 58 28 I long have been impressed with the truth that meaningful prayer requires both holy communication and consecrated work Blessings require some effort on our part before we can obtain them and prayer as a form of work is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings Bible Dictionary Prayer 753 We press forward and persevere in the consecrated work of prayer after we say amen by acting upon the things we have expressed to Heavenly Father Asking in faith requires honesty effort commitment and persistence Let me provide an illustration of what I mean and extend to you an invitation We properly pray for the safety and success of the full time missionaries throughout the world And a common element in many of our prayers is a request that the missionaries will be led to individuals and families who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration But ultimately it is my responsibility and your responsibility to find people for the missionaries to teach Missionaries are full time teachers you and I are full time finders And you and I as lifelong missionaries should not be praying for the full time missionaries to do our work If you and I would truly pray and ask in faith as did Joseph Smith if we would pray with the expectation to act and not just to express then the work of proclaiming the gospel would move forward in a remarkable way Such a prayer of faith might include some of the following elements Thanking Heavenly Father for the doctrines and ordinances of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ which bring hope and happiness into our lives Asking for courage and boldness to open our mouths and share the gospel with our family and friends Entreating Heavenly Father to help us identify individuals and families who will be receptive to our invitation to be taught by the missionaries in our homes Pledging to do our part this day and this week and petitioning for help to overcome anxiety fear and hesitation Seeking for the gift of discernment for eyes to see and ears to hear missionary opportunities as they occur Praying fervently for the strength to act as we know we should Gratitude would be expressed and other blessings might be requested in such a prayer which would be closed in the name of the Savior And then the consecrated work of that prayer would continue and increase This same pattern of holy communication and consecrated work can be applied in our prayers for the poor and the needy for the sick and the afflicted for family members and friends who are struggling and for those who are not attending Church meetings I testify that prayer becomes meaningful as we ask in faith and act I invite all of us to pray in faith about our divinely given mandate to proclaim the gospel As we do so I promise doors will open and we will be blessed to recognize and act upon the opportunities that will be provided After the Trial of Our FaithMy second example emphasizes the importance of persevering through the trial of our faith A few years ago a family traveled to Europe from the United States Shortly after arriving at their destination a 13 year old son became quite ill The mother and father initially thought his upset stomach was caused by fatigue from the long flight and the family routinely continued on its journey As the day continued the son s condition became worse Dehydration was increasing The father gave his son a priesthood blessing but no improvement was immediately evident Several hours passed by and the mother knelt by her son s side pleading in prayer to Heavenly Father for the boy s well being They were far from home in an unfamiliar country and did not know how to obtain medical assistance The mother asked her son if he would like to pray with her She knew that merely waiting for the anticipated blessing would not be enough they needed to continue to act Explaining that the blessing he had received was still in effect she suggested again petitioning in prayer as did the ancient Apostles Lord Increase our faith Luke 17 5 The prayer included a profession of trust in priesthood power and a commitment to persevere in doing whatever might be required for the blessing to be honored if that blessing at that time was in accordance with God s will Shortly after they offered this simple prayer the son s condition improved The faithful action of the mother and her son helped to invite the promised priesthood power and in part satisfied the requirement that we dispute not because we see not for we receive no witness until after the trial of our faith Ether 12 6 Just as the prison holding Alma and Amulek did not tumble to the earth until after their faith and just as Ammon and his missionary brethren did not witness mighty miracles in their ministries until after their faith see Ether 12 12 15 so the healing of this 13 year old boy did not occur until after their faith and was accomplished according to their faith in their prayers D C 10 47 Not My Will but Thine Be DoneMy third example highlights the importance of recognizing and accepting the will of God in our lives Several years ago there was a young father who had been active in the Church as a boy but had chosen a different path during his teenage years After serving in the military he married a lovely girl and soon children blessed their home One day without warning their little four year old daughter became critically ill and was hospitalized In desperation and for the first time in many years the father was found on his knees in prayer asking that the life of his daughter be spared Yet her condition worsened Gradually this father sensed that his little girl would not live and slowly his prayers changed he no longer prayed for healing but rather for understanding Let Thy will be done was now the manner of his pleadings Soon his daughter was in a coma and the father knew her hours on earth were few Fortified with understanding trust and power beyond their own the young parents prayed again asking for the opportunity to hold her close once more while she was awake The daughter s eyes opened and her frail arms reached out to her parents for one final embrace And then she was gone This father knew their prayers had been answered a kind compassionate Father in Heaven had comforted their hearts God s will had been done and they had gained understanding Adapted from H Burke Peterson Adversity and Prayer Ensign Jan 1974 18 Discerning and accepting the will of God in our lives are fundamental elements of asking in faith in meaningful prayer However simply saying the words Thy will be done is not enough Each of us needs God s help in surrendering our will to Him Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other Bible Dictionary Prayer 752 53 Humble earnest and persistent prayer enables us to recognize and align ourselves with the will of our Heavenly Father And in this the Savior provided the perfect example as He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane saying Father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly Luke 22 42 44 The object of our prayers should not be to present a wish list or a series of requests but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is eager to bestow according to His will and timing Every sincere prayer is heard and answered by our Heavenly Father but the answers we receive may not be what we expect or come to us when we want or in the way we anticipate This truth is evident in the three examples I have presented today Prayer is a privilege and the soul s sincere desire We can move beyond routine and checklist prayers and engage in meaningful prayer as we appropriately ask in faith and act as we patiently persevere through the trial of our faith and as we humbly acknowledge and accept not my will but Thine be done I witness the reality and divinity of our Eternal Father of His Only Begotten Son the Lord Jesus Christ and of the Holy Ghost I testify that our Father hears and answers our prayers May each of us strive with greater resolve to ask in faith and thereby make our prayers truly meaningful I so pray in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
I have fond childhood memories of my mother reading Book of Mormon stories to me She had a way of making the scriptural episodes come alive in my youthful imagination and I did not doubt that my mother had a witness of the truthfulness of that sacred record I especially remember her description of the Savior s visit to the American continent following His Resurrection and of His teachings to the people in the land of Bountiful Through the simple consistency of her example and testimony my mother kindled in me the first flames of faith in the Savior and in His latter day Church I came to know for myself that the Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ and contains the fulness of His everlasting gospel see D C 27 5 Today I want to review with you one of my favorite Book of Mormon events the Savior s appearance in the New World and discuss His instruction to the multitude about the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost I pray for the guidance of the Spirit for me and for you The Savior s Ministry in the New WorldDuring the Lord s three day ministry in the New World He taught His doctrine authorized His disciples to perform priesthood ordinances healed the sick prayed for the people and lovingly blessed the children As the Savior s time with the people was drawing to a close He succinctly summarized the fundamental principles of His gospel Said He Now this is the commandment Repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day 3 Nephi 27 20 The basic principles outlined by the Master in this scripture are essential for us to understand and apply in our lives First was repentance a turning of the heart and will to God and a renunciation of sin Bible Dictionary Repentance 760 As we appropriately seek for and receive the spiritual gift of faith in the Redeemer we then turn to and rely upon the merits the mercy and the grace of the Holy Messiah see 2 Nephi 2 8 Repentance is the sweet fruit that comes from faith in the Savior and involves turning toward God and away from sin The risen Lord next explained the importance of coming unto Him The multitude gathered together at the temple was invited literally to come forth unto the Savior one by one 3 Nephi 11 15 to feel the prints of the nails in the Master s hands and feet and to thrust their hands into His side Each individual who had this experience did know of a surety and did bear record that it was he v 15 even Jesus Christ who had come The Savior also taught the people to come unto Him through sacred covenants and He reminded them that they were the children of the covenant 3 Nephi 20 26 He emphasized the eternal importance of the ordinances of baptism see 3 Nephi 11 19 39 and of receiving the Holy Ghost see 3 Nephi 11 35 36 12 6 18 36 38 In a similar manner you and I are admonished to turn toward and learn from Christ and to come unto Him through the covenants and ordinances of His restored gospel As we do so we will eventually and ultimately come to know Him see John 17 3 in his own time and in his own way and according to his own will D C 88 68 as did the people in the land of Bountiful Repenting and coming unto Christ through the covenants and ordinances of salvation are prerequisite to and a preparation for being sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost and standing spotless before God at the last day I now want to focus our attention upon the sanctifying influence the Holy Ghost can be in our lives Our Spiritual JourneyThe gate of baptism leads to the strait and narrow path and to the destination of putting off the natural man and becoming a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord see Mosiah 3 19 The purpose of our mortal journey is not merely to see the sights on earth or to expend our allotment of time on self centered pursuits rather we are to walk in newness of life Romans 6 4 to become sanctified by yielding our hearts unto God see Helaman 3 35 and to obtain the mind of Christ 1 Corinthians 2 16 We are commanded and instructed to so live that our fallen nature is changed through the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost President Marion G Romney taught that the baptism of fire by the Holy Ghost converts us from carnality to spirituality It cleanses heals and purifies the soul Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ repentance and water baptism are all preliminary and prerequisite to it but the baptism of fire is the consummation To receive this baptism of fire is to have one s garments washed in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ Learning for the Eternities comp George J Romney 1977 133 see also 3 Nephi 27 19 20 Hence as we are born again and strive to always have His Spirit to be with us the Holy Ghost sanctifies and refines our souls as if by fire see 2 Nephi 31 13 14 17 Ultimately we are to stand spotless before God The gospel of Jesus Christ encompasses much more than avoiding overcoming and being cleansed from sin and the bad influences in our lives it also essentially entails doing good being good and becoming better Repenting of our sins and seeking forgiveness are spiritually necessary and we must always do so But remission of sin is not the only or even the ultimate purpose of the gospel To have our hearts changed by the Holy Spirit such that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually Mosiah 5 2 as did King Benjamin s people is the covenant responsibility we have accepted This mighty change is not simply the result of working harder or developing greater individual discipline Rather it is the consequence of a fundamental change in our desires our motives and our natures made possible through the Atonement of Christ the Lord Our spiritual purpose is to overcome both sin and the desire to sin both the taint and the tyranny of sin Prophets throughout the ages have emphasized the dual requirements of 1 avoiding and overcoming bad and 2 doing good and becoming better Consider the penetrating questions posed by the Psalmist Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place He that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully Psalm 24 3 4 Brothers and sisters it is possible for us to have clean hands but not have a pure heart Please notice that both clean hands and a pure heart are required to ascend into the hill of the Lord and to stand in His holy place Let me suggest that hands are made clean through the process of putting off the natural man and by overcoming sin and the evil influences in our lives through the Savior s Atonement Hearts are purified as we receive His strengthening power to do good and become better All of our worthy desires and good works as necessary as they are can never produce clean hands and a pure heart It is the Atonement of Jesus Christ that provides both a cleansing and redeeming power that helps us to overcome sin and a sanctifying and strengthening power that helps us to become better than we ever could by relying only upon our own strength The infinite Atonement is for both the sinner and for the saint in each of us In the Book of Mormon we find the masterful teachings of King Benjamin concerning the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ The simple doctrine he taught caused the congregation to fall to the earth for the fear of the Lord had come upon them And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state even less than the dust of the earth And they all cried aloud with one voice saying O have mercy and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins and our hearts may be purified for we believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God who created heaven and earth and all things who shall come down among the children of men Mosiah 4 2 emphasis added Again in this verse we find the twofold blessing of both forgiveness of sin suggesting clean hands and the transformation of our nature signifying pure hearts As King Benjamin concluded his instruction he reiterated the importance of these two basic aspects of spiritual development And now for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you that is for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day that ye may walk guiltless before God I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor Mosiah 4 26 emphasis added Our sincere desire should be to have both clean hands and a pure heart both a remission of sins from day to day and to walk guiltless before God Clean hands alone will not be enough when we stand before Him who is pure and who as a lamb without blemish and without spot 1 Peter 1 19 freely spilled His precious blood for us Line upon LineSome who hear or read this message may think the spiritual progress I am describing is not attainable in their lives We may believe these truths apply to others but not to us We will not attain a state of perfection in this life but we can and should press forward with faith in Christ along the strait and narrow path and make steady progress toward our eternal destiny The Lord s pattern for spiritual development is line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little 2 Nephi 28 30 Small steady incremental spiritual improvements are the steps the Lord would have us take Preparing to walk guiltless before God is one of the primary purposes of mortality and the pursuit of a lifetime it does not result from sporadic spurts of intense spiritual activity I witness that the Savior will strengthen and assist us to make sustained paced progress The example in the Book of Mormon of many exceedingly great many Alma 13 12 in the ancient Church who were pure and spotless before God is a source of encouragement and comfort to me I suspect those members of the ancient Church were ordinary men and women just like you and me These individuals could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence and they were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God v 12 And these principles and this process of spiritual progress apply to each of us equally and always Moroni s Concluding InvitationThe requirement to put off the natural man and become a saint to avoid and overcome bad and to do and become good to have clean hands and a pure heart is a recurring theme throughout the Book of Mormon In fact Moroni s concluding invitation at the end of the book is a summary of this theme Yea come unto Christ and be perfected in him and deny yourselves of all ungodliness and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love God with all your might mind and strength then is his grace sufficient for you that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ And again if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ and deny not his power then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God through the shedding of the blood of Christ which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins that ye become holy without spot Moroni 10 32 33 emphasis added May you and I repent with sincerity of heart and truly come unto Christ I pray that we will seek through the Savior s Atonement to have both clean hands and a pure heart that we may become holy without spot I witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Eternal Father and our Savior He who is without spot redeems us from sin and strengthens us to do good and to become better I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My boyhood home in California was located relatively close to large orchards of apricots cherries peaches pears and other delicious fruits We also lived near fields of cucumbers tomatoes and a variety of vegetables As a boy I always looked forward to canning season I did not like scrubbing the canning jars or working in our hot kitchen But I did like working with my mom and dad And I loved eating my work I am sure I ate more fruit than ever made it into any of our canning jars My memories of time spent in the kitchen with Mom and Dad are stirred every time I see a bottle of home canned cherries or peaches The basic lessons I learned about temporal self reliance and provident living while picking and canning produce have blessed me throughout my life Interestingly simple and ordinary experiences often provide the most important learning opportunities we ever have As an adult I have reflected upon the things I observed in our kitchen during canning season This morning I want to discuss some of the spiritual lessons we can learn from the process by which a cucumber becomes a pickle I invite the Holy Ghost to be with us as we consider the significance of those lessons for me and for you as we come unto Christ and are spiritually reborn Cucumbers and PicklesA pickle is a cucumber that has been transformed according to a specific recipe and series of steps The first steps in the process of changing a cucumber into a pickle are preparing and cleaning I remember many hours spent on the back porch of my home removing stems from and scrubbing dirt off of the cucumbers we had picked My mom was very particular about the preparing and cleaning of the cucumbers She had high standards of cleanliness and always inspected my work to make sure this important task was properly completed The next steps in this process of change are immersing and saturating the cucumbers in salt brine for an extended period of time To prepare the brine my mom always used a recipe she learned from her mother a recipe with special ingredients and precise procedures Cucumbers can only become pickles if they are totally and completely immersed in the brine for the prescribed time period The curing process gradually alters the composition of the cucumber and produces the transparent appearance and distinctive taste of a pickle An occasional sprinkle of or dip in the brine cannot produce the necessary transformation Rather steady sustained and complete immersion is required for the desired change to occur The final step in the process requires the sealing of the cured pickles in jars that have been sterilized and purified The pickles are packed in canning jars covered with boiling hot brine and processed in a boiling water bath canner All impurities must be removed from both the pickles and the bottles so the finished product can be protected and preserved As this procedure is properly followed the pickles can be stored and enjoyed for a long period of time To summarize a cucumber becomes a pickle as it is prepared and cleaned immersed in and saturated with salt brine and sealed in a sterilized container This procedure requires time and cannot be hurried and none of the essential steps can be ignored or avoided A Mighty ChangeThe Lord s authorized servants repeatedly teach that one of the principal purposes of our mortal existence is to be spiritually changed and transformed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ Alma declared Marvel not that all mankind yea men and women all nations kindreds tongues and people must be born again yea born of God changed from their carnal and fallen state to a state of righteousness being redeemed of God becoming his sons and daughters And thus they become new creatures and unless they do this they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God Mosiah 27 25 26 We are instructed to come unto Christ and be perfected in him and deny ourselves of all ungodliness Moroni 10 32 to become new creature s in Christ see 2 Corinthians 5 17 to put off the natural man Mosiah 3 19 and to experience a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually Mosiah 5 2 Please note that the conversion described in these verses is mighty not minor a spiritual rebirth and fundamental change of what we feel and desire what we think and do and what we are Indeed the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through our reliance upon the merits and mercy and grace of the Holy Messiah 2 Nephi 2 8 As we choose to follow the Master we choose to be changed to be spiritually reborn Preparing and CleaningJust as a cucumber must be prepared and cleaned before it can be changed into a pickle so you and I can be prepared with the words of faith and of good doctrine 1 Timothy 4 6 and initially cleansed through the ordinances and covenants administered by the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood And the lesser priesthood continued which priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism and the remission of sins D C 84 26 27 And the Lord has established a high standard of cleanliness Wherefore teach it unto your children that all men everywhere must repent or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God for no unclean thing can dwell there or dwell in his presence Moses 6 57 Proper preparing and cleaning are the first basic steps in the process of being born again Immersing and SaturatingJust as a cucumber is transformed into a pickle as it is immersed in and saturated with salt brine so you and I are born again as we are absorbed by and in the gospel of Jesus Christ As we honor and observe the covenants D C 42 13 into which we have entered as we feast upon the words of Christ 2 Nephi 32 3 as we pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart Moroni 7 48 and as we serve God with all of our heart might mind and strength D C 4 2 then Because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ his sons and his daughters for behold this day he hath spiritually begotten you for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name therefore ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters Mosiah 5 7 The spiritual rebirth described in this verse typically does not occur quickly or all at once it is an ongoing process not a single event Line upon line and precept upon precept gradually and almost imperceptibly our motives our thoughts our words and our deeds become aligned with the will of God This phase of the transformation process requires time persistence and patience A cucumber only becomes a pickle through steady sustained and complete immersion in salt brine Significantly salt is the key ingredient in the recipe Salt frequently is used in the scriptures as a symbol both of a covenant and of a covenant people And just as salt is essential in transforming a cucumber into a pickle so covenants are central to our spiritual rebirth We begin the process of being born again through exercising faith in Christ repenting of our sins and being baptized by immersion for the remission of sins by one having priesthood authority Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life Romans 6 4 And after we come out of the waters of baptism our souls need to be continuously immersed in and saturated with the truth and the light of the Savior s gospel Sporadic and shallow dipping in the doctrine of Christ and partial participation in His restored Church cannot produce the spiritual transformation that enables us to walk in a newness of life Rather fidelity to covenants constancy of commitment and offering our whole soul unto God are required if we are to receive the blessings of eternity I would that ye should come unto Christ who is the Holy One of Israel and partake of his salvation and the power of his redemption Yea come unto him and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him and continue in fasting and praying and endure to the end and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved Omni 1 26 Total immersion in and saturation with the Savior s gospel are essential steps in the process of being born again Purifying and SealingCured cucumbers are packed into sterilized jars and heat processed in order to remove impurities and to seal the containers from external contaminants The boiling water bath procedure enables the pickles to be both protected and preserved over a long period of time In a similar way we progressively become purified and sanctified as you and I are washed in the blood of the Lamb are born again and receive the ordinances and honor the covenants that are administered by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation yea even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God Helaman 3 35 The word sealing in my message today does not refer exclusively to the ordinance of eternal marriage performed in the house of the Lord Rather I am using this particular word as explained in the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants This is the testimony of the gospel of Christ concerning them who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just They are they who received the testimony of Jesus and believed on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial being buried in the water in his name and this according to the commandment which he has given That by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power And who overcome by faith and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true vv 50 53 The Holy Spirit of Promise is the ratifying power of the Holy Ghost When sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise an ordinance vow or covenant is binding on earth and in heaven See D C 132 7 Receiving this stamp of approval from the Holy Ghost is the result of faithfulness integrity and steadfastness in honoring gospel covenants in the process of time Moses 7 21 However this sealing can be forfeited through unrighteousness and transgression Purifying and sealing by the Holy Spirit of Promise constitute the culminating steps in the process of being born again In the Energy of My Soul My beloved brothers and sisters I pray this parable of the pickle may help us to evaluate our lives and to better understand the eternal importance of spiritual rebirth With Alma I speak in the energy of my soul Alma 5 43 I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called yea to preach unto my beloved brethren yea and every one that dwelleth in the land yea to preach unto all both old and young both bond and free yea I say unto you the aged and also the middle aged and the rising generation yea to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again Alma 5 49 I witness the reality and divinity of a living Savior who invites us to come unto Him and be transformed I testify His Church and priesthood authority have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith Through faith in Christ we can be spiritually prepared and cleansed from sin immersed in and saturated with His gospel and purified and sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise even born again In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
This afternoon I pray that the Holy Ghost will assist me and you as we review together important gospel principles One of my favorite activities as a priesthood leader is visiting members of the Church in their homes I especially enjoy calling upon and talking with members who commonly are described as less active During the years I served as a stake president I often would contact one of the bishops and invite him to prayerfully identify individuals or families we could visit together Before traveling to a home the bishop and I would kneel and petition our Heavenly Father for guidance and inspiration for us and for the members with whom we would meet Our visits were quite straightforward We expressed love and appreciation for the opportunity to be in their home We affirmed that we were servants of the Lord on His errand to their home We indicated that we missed and needed them and that they needed the blessings of the restored gospel And at some point early in our conversation I often would ask a question like this Will you please help us understand why you are not actively participating in the blessings and programs of the Church I made hundreds and hundreds of such visits Each individual each family each home and each answer was different Over the years however I detected a common theme in many of the answers to my questions Frequently responses like these were given Several years ago a man said something in Sunday School that offended me and I have not been back since No one in this branch greeted or reached out to me I felt like an outsider I was hurt by the unfriendliness of this branch I did not agree with the counsel the bishop gave me I will not step foot in that building again as long as he is serving in that position Many other causes of offense were cited from doctrinal differences among adults to taunting teasing and excluding by youth But the recurring theme was I was offended by The bishop and I would listen intently and sincerely One of us might next ask about their conversion to and testimony of the restored gospel As we talked eyes often were moist with tears as these good people recalled the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost and described their prior spiritual experiences Most of the less active people I have ever visited had a discernible and tender testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel However they were not presently participating in Church activities and meetings And then I would say something like this Let me make sure I understand what has happened to you Because someone at church offended you you have not been blessed by the ordinance of the sacrament You have withdrawn yourself from the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost Because someone at church offended you you have cut yourself off from priesthood ordinances and the holy temple You have discontinued your opportunity to serve others and to learn and grow And you are leaving barriers that will impede the spiritual progress of your children your children s children and the generations that will follow Many times people would think for a moment and then respond I have never thought about it that way The bishop and I would then extend an invitation Dear friend we are here today to counsel you that the time to stop being offended is now Not only do we need you but you need the blessings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Please come back now Choose Not to Be OffendedWhen we believe or say we have been offended we usually mean we feel insulted mistreated snubbed or disrespected And certainly clumsy embarrassing unprincipled and mean spirited things do occur in our interactions with other people that would allow us to take offense However it ultimately is impossible for another person to offend you or to offend me Indeed believing that another person offended us is fundamentally false To be offended is a choice we make it is not a condition inflicted or imposed upon us by someone or something else In the grand division of all of God s creations there are things to act and things to be acted upon see 2 Nephi 2 13 14 As sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father we have been blessed with the gift of moral agency the capacity for independent action and choice Endowed with agency you and I are agents and we primarily are to act and not just be acted upon To believe that someone or something can make us feel offended angry hurt or bitter diminishes our moral agency and transforms us into objects to be acted upon As agents however you and I have the power to act and to choose how we will respond to an offensive or hurtful situation Thomas B Marsh the first President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in this dispensation elected to take offense over an issue as inconsequential as milk strippings see Deseret News Apr 16 1856 44 Brigham Young on the other hand was severely and publicly rebuked by the Prophet Joseph Smith but he chose not to take offense see Truman G Madsen Hugh B Brown Youthful Veteran New Era Apr 1976 16 In many instances choosing to be offended is a symptom of a much deeper and more serious spiritual malady Thomas B Marsh allowed himself to be acted upon and the eventual results were apostasy and misery Brigham Young was an agent who exercised his agency and acted in accordance with correct principles and he became a mighty instrument in the hands of the Lord The Savior is the greatest example of how we should respond to potentially offensive events or situations And the world because of their iniquity shall judge him to be a thing of naught wherefore they scourge him and he suffereth it and they smite him and he suffereth it Yea they spit upon him and he suffereth it because of his loving kindness and his long suffering towards the children of men 1 Nephi 19 9 Through the strengthening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ you and I can be blessed to avoid and triumph over offense Great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them Psalm 119 165 A Latter Day Learning LaboratoryThe capacity to conquer offense may seem beyond our reach This capability however is not reserved for or restricted to prominent leaders in the Church like Brigham Young The very nature of the Redeemer s Atonement and the purpose of the restored Church are intended to help us receive precisely this kind of spiritual strength Paul taught the Saints in Ephesus that the Savior established His Church for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ Ephesians 4 12 13 Please note the use of the active word perfecting As described by Elder Neal A Maxwell the Church is not a well provisioned rest home for the already perfected A Brother Offended Ensign May 1982 38 Rather the Church is a learning laboratory and a workshop in which we gain experience as we practice on each other in the ongoing process of perfecting the Saints Elder Maxwell also insightfully explained that in this latter day learning laboratory known as the restored Church the members constitute the clinical material see Jesus the Perfect Mentor Ensign Feb 2001 13 that is essential for growth and development A visiting teacher learns her duty as she serves and loves her Relief Society sisters An inexperienced teacher learns valuable lessons as he teaches both supportive and inattentive learners and thereby becomes a more effective teacher And a new bishop learns how to be a bishop through inspiration and by working with ward members who wholeheartedly sustain him even while recognizing his human frailties Understanding that the Church is a learning laboratory helps us to prepare for an inevitable reality In some way and at some time someone in this Church will do or say something that could be considered offensive Such an event will surely happen to each and every one of us and it certainly will occur more than once Though people may not intend to injure or offend us they nonetheless can be inconsiderate and tactless You and I cannot control the intentions or behavior of other people However we do determine how we will act Please remember that you and I are agents endowed with moral agency and we can choose not to be offended During a perilous period of war an exchange of letters occurred between Moroni the captain of the Nephite armies and Pahoran the chief judge and governor of the land Moroni whose army was suffering because of inadequate support from the government wrote to Pahoran by the way of condemnation Alma 60 2 and harshly accused him of thoughtlessness slothfulness and neglect Pahoran might easily have resented Moroni and his message but he chose not to take offense Pahoran responded compassionately and described a rebellion against the government about which Moroni was not aware And then he responded Behold I say unto you Moroni that I do not joy in your great afflictions yea it grieves my soul And now in your epistle you have censured me but it mattereth not I am not angry but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart Alma 61 2 9 One of the greatest indicators of our own spiritual maturity is revealed in how we respond to the weaknesses the inexperience and the potentially offensive actions of others A thing an event or an expression may be offensive but you and I can choose not to be offended and to say with Pahoran it mattereth not Two InvitationsI conclude my message with two invitations Invitation 1I invite you to learn about and apply the Savior s teachings about interactions and episodes that can be construed as offensive Ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy But I say unto you Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you For if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same And if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect Matthew 5 43 44 46 48 Interestingly the admonition to be ye therefore perfect is immediately preceded by counsel about how we should act in response to wrongdoing and offense Clearly the rigorous requirements that lead to the perfecting of the Saints include assignments that test and challenge us If a person says or does something that we consider offensive our first obligation is to refuse to take offense and then communicate privately honestly and directly with that individual Such an approach invites inspiration from the Holy Ghost and permits misperceptions to be clarified and true intent to be understood Invitation 2Many of the individuals and families who most need to hear this message about choosing not to be offended are probably not participating with us in conference today I suspect all of us are acquainted with members who are staying away from church because they have chosen to take offense and who would be blessed by coming back Will you please prayerfully identify a person with whom you will visit and extend the invitation to once again worship with us Perhaps you could share a copy of this talk with her or him or you may prefer to discuss the principles we have reviewed today And please remember that such a request should be conveyed lovingly and in meekness and not in a spirit of self righteous superiority and pride As we respond to this invitation with faith in the Savior I testify and promise that doors will open our mouths will be filled the Holy Ghost will bear witness of eternal truth and the fire of testimony will be rekindled As His servant I echo the words of the Master when He declared These things have I spoken unto you that ye should not be offended John 16 1 I witness the reality and divinity of a living Savior and of His power to help us avoid and overcome offense In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Today I speak by way of reminder and admonition to those of us who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to now assist me and you as we learn together Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins is the introductory ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ and must be preceded by faith in the Savior and by sincere and complete repentance Baptism in water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit in order to be complete see Bible Dictionary Baptism 618 As the Savior taught Nicodemus Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God John 3 5 My message this afternoon focuses on the baptism of the Spirit and the blessings that flow from the companionship of the Holy Ghost The Ordinance of and Covenant Associated with BaptismAs each of us was baptized we entered into a solemn covenant with our Heavenly Father A covenant is an agreement between God and His children upon the earth and it is important to understand that God determines the conditions of all gospel covenants You and I do not decide the nature or elements of a covenant Rather exercising our moral agency we accept the terms and requirements of a covenant as our Eternal Father has established them see Bible Dictionary Covenant 651 The saving ordinance of baptism must be administered by one who has proper authority from God The fundamental conditions of the covenant into which we entered in the waters of baptism are these we witnessed that we were willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ that we would always remember Him and that we would keep His commandments The promised blessing for honoring this covenant is that we may always have His Spirit to be with us see D C 20 77 In other words baptism by water leads to the authorized opportunity for the constant companionship of the third member of the Godhead Confirmation and the Baptism of the SpiritFollowing our baptism each of us had hands placed upon our head by those with priesthood authority and was confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and the Holy Ghost was conferred upon us see D C 49 14 The statement receive the Holy Ghost in our confirmation was a directive to strive for the baptism of the Spirit The Prophet Joseph Smith taught You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost Baptism by water is but half a baptism and is good for nothing without the other half that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost History of the Church 5 499 We were baptized by immersion in water for the remission of sins We must also be baptized by and immersed in the Spirit of the Lord and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost 2 Ne 31 17 As we gain experience with the Holy Ghost we learn that the intensity with which we feel the Spirit s influence is not always the same Strong dramatic spiritual impressions do not come to us frequently Even as we strive to be faithful and obedient there simply are times when the direction assurance and peace of the Spirit are not readily recognizable in our lives In fact the Book of Mormon describes faithful Lamanites who were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost and they knew it not 3 Ne 9 20 The influence of the Holy Ghost is described in the scriptures as a still small voice 1 Kgs 19 12 see also 3 Ne 11 3 and a voice of perfect mildness Hel 5 30 Thus the Spirit of the Lord usually communicates with us in ways that are quiet delicate and subtle Withdrawing Ourselves from the Spirit of the LordIn our individual study and classroom instruction we repeatedly emphasize the importance of recognizing the inspiration and promptings we receive from the Spirit of the Lord And such an approach is correct and useful We should seek diligently to recognize and respond to promptings as they come to us However an important aspect of baptism by the Spirit may frequently be overlooked in our spiritual development We should also endeavor to discern when we withdraw ourselves from the Spirit of the Lord that it may have no place in us to guide us in wisdom s paths that we may be blessed prospered and preserved Mosiah 2 36 Precisely because the promised blessing is that we may always have His Spirit to be with us we should attend to and learn from the choices and influences that separate us from the Holy Spirit The standard is clear If something we think see hear or do distances us from the Holy Ghost then we should stop thinking seeing hearing or doing that thing If that which is intended to entertain for example alienates us from the Holy Spirit then certainly that type of entertainment is not for us Because the Spirit cannot abide that which is vulgar crude or immodest then clearly such things are not for us Because we estrange the Spirit of the Lord when we engage in activities we know we should shun then such things definitely are not for us I recognize we are fallen men and women living in a mortal world and that we might not have the presence of the Holy Ghost with us every second of every minute of every hour of every day However the Holy Ghost can tarry with us much if not most of the time and certainly the Spirit can be with us more than it is not with us As we become ever more immersed in the Spirit of the Lord we should strive to recognize impressions when they come and the influences or events that cause us to withdraw ourselves from the Holy Ghost Taking the Holy Spirit for our guide D C 45 57 is possible and is essential for our spiritual growth and survival in an increasingly wicked world Sometimes as Latter day Saints we talk and act as though recognizing the influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives is the rare or exceptional event We should remember however that the covenant promise is that we may always have His Spirit to be with us This supernal blessing applies to every single member of the Church who has been baptized confirmed and instructed to receive the Holy Ghost The Liahona as a Type and Shadow for Our DayIn our day the Book of Mormon is the primary source to which we should turn for help in learning how to invite the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost The description in the Book of Mormon of the Liahona the director or compass used by Lehi and his family in their journey in the wilderness specifically was included in the record as a type and a shadow for our day and as an essential lesson about what we should do to enjoy the blessings of the Holy Ghost As we strive to align our attitudes and actions with righteousness then the Holy Ghost becomes for us today what the Liahona was for Lehi and his family in their day The very factors that caused the Liahona to work for Lehi will likewise invite the Holy Ghost into our lives And the very factors that caused the Liahona not to work anciently will likewise cause us to withdraw ourselves from the Holy Ghost today The Liahona Purposes and PrinciplesAs we study and ponder the purposes of the Liahona and the principles by which it operated I testify that we will receive inspiration suited to our individual and family circumstances and needs We can and will be blessed with ongoing direction from the Holy Ghost The Liahona was prepared by the Lord and given to Lehi and his family after they left Jerusalem and were traveling in the wilderness see Alma 37 38 D C 17 1 This compass or director pointed the way that Lehi and his caravan should go see 1 Ne 16 10 even a straight course to the promised land Alma 37 44 The pointers in the Liahona operated according to the faith and diligence and heed 1 Ne 16 28 of the travelers and failed to work when family members were contentious rude slothful or forgetful see 1 Ne 18 12 21 Alma 37 41 43 The compass also provided a means whereby Lehi and his family could obtain greater understanding concerning the ways of the Lord 1 Ne 16 29 Thus the primary purposes of the Liahona were to provide both direction and instruction during a long and demanding journey The director was a physical instrument that served as an outward indicator of their inner spiritual standing before God It worked according to the principles of faith and diligence Just as Lehi was blessed in ancient times each of us in this day has been given a spiritual compass that can direct and instruct us during our mortal journey The Holy Ghost was conferred upon you and me as we came out of the world and into the Savior s Church through baptism and confirmation By the authority of the holy priesthood we were confirmed as members of the Church and admonished to seek for the constant companionship of the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you John 14 17 As we each press forward along the pathway of life we receive direction from the Holy Ghost just as Lehi was directed through the Liahona For behold again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way and receive the Holy Ghost it will show unto you all things what ye should do 2 Ne 32 5 The Holy Ghost operates in our lives precisely as the Liahona did for Lehi and his family according to our faith and diligence and heed Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth D C 121 45 46 And the Holy Ghost provides for us today the means whereby we can receive by small and simple things Alma 37 6 increased understanding about the ways of the Lord But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you John 14 26 The Spirit of the Lord can be our guide and will bless us with direction instruction and spiritual protection during our mortal journey We invite the Holy Ghost into our lives through meaningful personal and family prayer feasting upon the words of Christ diligent and exacting obedience faithfulness and honoring of covenants and through virtue humility and service And we steadfastly should avoid things that are immodest coarse crude sinful or evil that cause us to withdraw ourselves from the Holy Ghost We also invite the ongoing companionship of the Holy Ghost as we worthily partake of the sacrament each Sabbath day And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day D C 59 9 Through the ordinance of the sacrament we renew our baptismal covenant and can receive and retain a remission of our sins see Mosiah 4 12 26 In addition we are reminded on a weekly basis of the promise that we may always have His Spirit to be with us As we then strive to keep ourselves clean and unspotted from the world we become worthy vessels in whom the Spirit of the Lord can always dwell In February of 1847 the Prophet Joseph Smith appeared to Brigham Young in a dream or vision President Young asked the Prophet if he had a message for the Brethren The Prophet Joseph replied Tell the people to be humble and faithful and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right Be careful and not turn away the small still voice it will teach them what to do and where to go it will yield the fruits of the kingdom see Teachings of Presidents of the Church Brigham Young 1997 41 emphasis added Of all the truths the Prophet Joseph might have taught Brigham Young on that sacred occasion he emphasized the importance of obtaining and keeping the Spirit of the Lord My beloved brothers and sisters I testify of the living reality of God the Eternal Father and of His Son Jesus Christ and of the Holy Ghost May each of us so live that we may always have His Spirit to be with us and thereby qualify for the blessings of direction instruction and protection that are essential in these latter days In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
All of us who have received the holy priesthood bear the sacred obligation to bless the nations and families of the earth by proclaiming the gospel and inviting all to receive by proper authority the ordinances of salvation Many of us have served as full time missionaries some of us presently are serving as full time missionaries and all of us now are serving and will continue to serve as lifelong missionaries We are missionaries every day in our families in our schools in our places of employment and in our communities Regardless of our age experience or station in life we are all missionaries Proclaiming the gospel is not an activity in which we periodically and temporarily engage And our labors as missionaries certainly are not confined to the short period of time devoted to full time missionary service in our youth or in our mature years Rather the obligation to proclaim the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is inherent in the oath and covenant of the priesthood into which we enter Missionary work essentially is a priesthood responsibility and all of us who hold the priesthood are the Lord s authorized servants on the earth and are missionaries at all times and in all places and we always will be Our very identity as holders of the priesthood and the seed of Abraham is in large measure defined by the responsibility to proclaim the gospel My message tonight is applicable to all of us in our priesthood duty to proclaim the gospel My specific purpose in this priesthood meeting however is to talk candidly with the young men of the Church who are preparing for the call to serve as missionaries The principles I will discuss with you are both simple and spiritually significant and they should cause us to ponder to evaluate and to improve I pray for the companionship of the Holy Ghost for me and for you as we consider together this important subject A Frequently Asked QuestionIn meetings with young members of the Church around the world I often invite those in attendance to ask questions One of the questions I am asked most frequently by young men is this What can I do to prepare most effectively to serve as a full time missionary Such a sincere question deserves a serious response My dear young brethren the single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to become a missionary long before you go on a mission Please notice that in my answer I emphasized becoming rather than going Let me explain what I mean In our customary Church vocabulary we often speak of going to church going to the temple and going on a mission Let me be so bold as to suggest that our rather routine emphasis on going misses the mark The issue is not going to church rather the issue is worshipping and renewing covenants as we attend church The issue is not going to or through the temple rather the issue is having in our hearts the spirit the covenants and the ordinances of the Lord s house The issue is not going on a mission rather the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart might mind and strength It is possible for a young man to go on a mission and not become a missionary and this is not what the Lord requires or what the Church needs My earnest hope for each of you young men is that you will not simply go on a mission but that you will become missionaries long before you submit your mission papers long before you receive a call to serve long before you are set apart by your stake president and long before you enter the MTC The Principle of BecomingElder Dallin H Oaks has taught us most effectively about the challenge to become something instead of just doing expected things or performing certain actions The Apostle Paul taught that the Lord s teachings and teachers were given that we may all attain the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ Eph 4 13 This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge It is not even enough for us to be convinced of the gospel we must act and think so that we are converted by it In contrast to the institutions of the world which teach us to know something the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become something It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions The commandments ordinances and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become The Challenge to Become Liahona Jan 2001 40 Ensign Nov 2000 32 Brethren the challenge to become applies precisely and perfectly to missionary preparation Obviously the process of becoming a missionary does not require a young man to wear a white shirt and tie to school every day or to follow the missionary guidelines for going to bed and getting up although most parents certainly would support that idea But you can increase in your desire to serve God see D C 4 3 and you can begin to think as missionaries think to read what missionaries read to pray as missionaries pray and to feel what missionaries feel You can avoid the worldly influences that cause the Holy Ghost to withdraw and you can grow in confidence in recognizing and responding to spiritual promptings Line upon line and precept upon precept here a little and there a little you can gradually become the missionary you hope to be and the missionary the Savior expects You will not suddenly or magically be transformed into a prepared and obedient missionary on the day you walk through the front door of the Missionary Training Center What you have become in the days and months and years prior to your missionary service is what you will be in the MTC In fact the nature of the transition through which you will pass in the MTC will be a strong indicator of your progress in becoming a missionary As you enter the MTC you obviously will miss your family and many aspects of your daily schedule will be new and challenging But for a young man well on his way to becoming a missionary the basic adjustment to the rigors of missionary work and lifestyle will not be overwhelming burdensome or constraining Thus a key element of raising the bar includes working to become a missionary before going on a mission Fathers do you understand your role in helping your son to become a missionary before he goes on a mission You and your wife are key in the process of his becoming a missionary Priesthood and auxiliary leaders do you recognize your responsibility to assist parents and to help every young man become a missionary before he goes on a mission The bar also has been raised for parents and for all members of the Church Prayerful pondering of the principle of becoming will invite inspiration tailored to the specific needs of your son or to the young men whom you serve The preparation I am describing is not oriented only toward your missionary service as a 19 or 20 or 21 year old young man Brethren you are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work As holders of the priesthood we are missionaries always If you truly progress in the process of becoming a missionary both before going on a mission and in the mission field then when the day arrives for your honorable release as a full time missionary you will depart from your field of labor and return to your family but you will never cease your missionary service A priesthood holder is a missionary at all times and in all places A missionary is who and what we are as bearers of the priesthood and as the seed of Abraham The Seed of AbrahamThe heirs of all the promises and covenants made by God to Abraham are referred to as the seed of Abraham see Bible Dictionary Seed of Abraham 771 These blessings are obtained only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ Brethren the process of becoming a missionary is directly related to understanding who we are as the seed of Abraham Abraham was a great prophet who desired righteousness and was obedient to all of the commandments he received from God including the command to offer as a sacrifice his precious son Isaac Because of his steadfastness and obedience Abraham is often referred to as the father of the faithful and Heavenly Father established a covenant with and promised great blessings to Abraham and his posterity Because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son That in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice Gen 22 16 18 Thus Abraham was promised a great posterity and that the nations of the earth would be blessed through that posterity How are the nations of the earth blessed through the seed of Abraham The answer to this important question is found in the book of Abraham And I will make of thee Abraham a great nation and I will bless thee above measure and make thy name great among all nations and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations And I will bless them through thy name for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name and shall be accounted thy seed and shall rise up and bless thee as their father Abr 2 9 10 We learn in these verses that Abraham s faithful heirs would have the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood Thus the phrase bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations refers to the responsibility to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ and to invite all to receive by proper priesthood authority the ordinances of salvation Truly great responsibility rests upon the seed of Abraham in these latter days How do these promises and blessings relate to us today Either by literal lineage or adoption every man and boy within the sound of my voice tonight is a rightful heir to the promises made by God to Abraham We are the seed of Abraham One of the primary reasons we receive a patriarchal blessing is to help us more fully understand who we are as the posterity of Abraham and to recognize the responsibility that rests upon us My beloved brethren you and I today and always are to bless all peoples in all the nations of the earth You and I today and always are to bear witness of Jesus Christ and declare the message of the Restoration You and I today and always are to invite all to receive the ordinances of salvation Proclaiming the gospel is not a part time priesthood obligation It is not simply an activity in which we engage for a limited time or an assignment we must complete as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Rather missionary work is a manifestation of our spiritual identity and heritage We were foreordained in the premortal existence and born into mortality to fulfill the covenant and promise God made to Abraham We are here upon the earth at this time to magnify the priesthood and to preach the gospel That is who we are and that is why we are here today and always You may enjoy music athletics or be mechanically inclined and someday you may work in a trade or a profession or in the arts As important as such activities and occupations can be they do not define who we are First and foremost we are spiritual beings We are sons of God and the seed of Abraham For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken and the magnifying their calling are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham and the church and kingdom and the elect of God D C 84 33 34 My dear brethren we have been given much and much is required of us May you young men more fully understand who you are as the seed of Abraham and become missionaries long before you go on a mission After coming back to your homes and families may you returned missionaries always be missionaries And may all of us rise up as men of God and bless the nations of the earth with greater testimony and spiritual power than we ever have before I declare my witness that Jesus is the Christ our Savior and Redeemer I know that He lives And I witness that we as holders of the priesthood are His representatives in the glorious work of proclaiming His gospel today and always In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Six months ago I stood at this pulpit for the first time as the newest member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Both then and even more so now I have felt and feel the weight of the call to serve and of the responsibility to teach with clarity and to testify with authority I pray for and invite the assistance of the Holy Ghost as I now speak with you This afternoon I want to describe and discuss a spiritual impression I received a few moments before I stepped to this pulpit during the Sunday morning session of general conference last October Elder Dieter F Uchtdorf had just finished speaking and had declared his powerful witness of the Savior Then we all stood together to sing the intermediate hymn that previously had been announced by President Gordon B Hinckley The intermediate hymn that morning was Redeemer of Israel Hymns no 6 Now the music for the various conference sessions had been determined many weeks before and obviously long before my new call to serve If however I had been invited to suggest an intermediate hymn for that particular session of the conference a hymn that would have been both edifying and spiritually soothing for me and for the congregation before my first address in this Conference Center I would have selected my favorite hymn Redeemer of Israel Tears filled my eyes as I stood with you to sing that stirring hymn of the Restoration Near the conclusion of the singing to my mind came this verse from the Book of Mormon But behold I Nephi will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen because of their faith to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance 1 Ne 1 20 My mind was drawn immediately to Nephi s phrase the tender mercies of the Lord and I knew in that very moment I was experiencing just such a tender mercy A loving Savior was sending me a most personal and timely message of comfort and reassurance through a hymn selected weeks previously Some may count this experience as simply a nice coincidence but I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are real and that they do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence Often the Lord s timing of His tender mercies helps us to both discern and acknowledge them What Are the Tender Mercies of the Lord Since last October I have reflected repeatedly upon the phrase the tender mercies of the Lord Through personal study observation pondering and prayer I believe I have come to better understand that the Lord s tender mercies are the very personal and individualized blessings strength protection assurances guidance loving kindnesses consolation support and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ Truly the Lord suits his mercies according to the conditions of the children of men D C 46 15 Recall how the Savior instructed His Apostles that He would not leave them comfortless Not only would He send another Comforter John 14 16 even the Holy Ghost but the Savior said that He would come to them see John 14 18 Let me suggest that one of the ways whereby the Savior comes to each of us is through His abundant and tender mercies For instance as you and I face challenges and tests in our lives the gift of faith and an appropriate sense of personal confidence that reaches beyond our own capacity are two examples of the tender mercies of the Lord Repentance and forgiveness of sins and peace of conscience are examples of the tender mercies of the Lord And the persistence and the fortitude that enable us to press forward with cheerfulness through physical limitations and spiritual difficulties are examples of the tender mercies of the Lord In a recent stake conference the tender mercies of the Lord were evident in the touching testimony of a young wife and mother of four whose husband was slain in Iraq in December of 2003 This stalwart sister recounted how after being notified of her husband s death she received his Christmas card and message In the midst of the abrupt reality of a dramatically altered life came to this good sister a timely and tender reminder that indeed families can be together forever With permission I quote from that Christmas card To the best family in the world Have a great time together and remember the true meaning of Christmas The Lord has made it possible for us to be together forever So even when we are apart we will still be together as a family God bless and keep y all safe and grant this Christmas to be our gift of love from us to Him above All my love Daddy and your loving husband Clearly the husband s reference to being apart in his Christmas greeting referred to the separation caused by his military assignment But to this sister as a voice from the dust from a departed eternal companion and father came a most needed spiritual reassurance and witness As I indicated earlier the Lord s tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence Faithfulness obedience and humility invite tender mercies into our lives and it is often the Lord s timing that enables us to recognize and treasure these important blessings Some time ago I spoke with a priesthood leader who was prompted to memorize the names of all of the youth ages 13 to 21 in his stake Using snapshots of the young men and women he created flash cards that he reviewed while traveling on business and at other times This priesthood leader quickly learned all of the names of the youth One night the priesthood leader had a dream about one of the young men whom he knew only from a picture In the dream he saw the young man dressed in a white shirt and wearing a missionary name tag With a companion seated at his side the young man was teaching a family The young man held the Book of Mormon in his hand and he looked as if he were testifying of the truthfulness of the book The priesthood leader then awoke from his dream At an ensuing priesthood gathering the leader approached the young man he had seen in his dream and asked to talk with him for a few minutes After a brief introduction the leader called the young man by name and said I am not a dreamer I have never had a dream about a single member of this stake except for you I am going to tell you about my dream and then I would like you to help me understand what it means The priesthood leader recounted the dream and asked the young man about its meaning Choking with emotion the young man simply replied It means God knows who I am The remainder of the conversation between this young man and his priesthood leader was most meaningful and they agreed to meet and counsel together from time to time during the following months That young man received the Lord s tender mercies through an inspired priesthood leader I repeat again the Lord s tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence Faithfulness and obedience enable us to receive these important gifts and frequently the Lord s timing helps us to recognize them We should not underestimate or overlook the power of the Lord s tender mercies The simpleness the sweetness and the constancy of the tender mercies of the Lord will do much to fortify and protect us in the troubled times in which we do now and will yet live When words cannot provide the solace we need or express the joy we feel when it is simply futile to attempt to explain that which is unexplainable when logic and reason cannot yield adequate understanding about the injustices and inequities of life when mortal experience and evaluation are insufficient to produce a desired outcome and when it seems that perhaps we are so totally alone truly we are blessed by the tender mercies of the Lord and made mighty even unto the power of deliverance see 1 Ne 1 20 Who Are They Whom the Lord Has Chosen to Receive His Tender Mercies The word chosen in 1 Nephi 1 20 1 Ne 1 20 is central to understanding the concept of the Lord s tender mercies The dictionary indicates that chosen suggests one who is selected taken by preference or picked out It also can be used to refer to the elect or chosen of God Oxford English Dictionary Online second ed 1989 Chosen Some individuals who hear or read this message erroneously may discount or dismiss in their personal lives the availability of the tender mercies of the Lord believing that I certainly am not one who has been or ever will be chosen We may falsely think that such blessings and gifts are reserved for other people who appear to be more righteous or who serve in visible Church callings I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are available to all of us and that the Redeemer of Israel is eager to bestow such gifts upon us To be or to become chosen is not an exclusive status conferred upon us Rather you and I ultimately determine if we are chosen Please now note the use of the word chosen in the following verses from the Doctrine and Covenants Behold there are many called but few are chosen And why are they not chosen Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world and aspire to the honors of men D C 121 34 35 emphasis added I believe the implication of these verses is quite straightforward God does not have a list of favorites to which we must hope our names will someday be added He does not limit the chosen to a restricted few Rather it is our hearts and our aspirations and our obedience which definitively determine whether we are counted as one of God s chosen Enoch was instructed by the Lord on this very point of doctrine Please note the use of the word choose in these verses Behold these thy brethren they are the workmanship of mine own hands and I gave unto them their knowledge in the day I created them and in the Garden of Eden gave I unto man his agency And unto thy brethren have I said and also given commandment that they should love one another and that they should choose me their Father Moses 7 32 33 emphasis added As we learn in these scriptures the fundamental purposes for the gift of agency were to love one another and to choose God Thus we become God s chosen and invite His tender mercies as we use our agency to choose God One of the most well known and frequently cited passages of scripture is found in Moses 1 39 This verse clearly and concisely describes the work of the Eternal Father For behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man emphasis added A companion scripture found in the Doctrine and Covenants describes with equal clarity and conciseness our primary work as the sons and daughters of the Eternal Father Interestingly this verse does not seem to be as well known and is not quoted with great frequency Behold this is your work to keep my commandments yea with all your might mind and strength D C 11 20 emphasis added Thus the Father s work is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children Our work is to keep His commandments with all of our might mind and strength and we thereby become chosen and through the Holy Ghost receive and recognize the tender mercies of the Lord in our daily lives The very conference in which we are participating this weekend is yet another example of the Lord s tender mercies We have been blessed to receive inspired counsel from the leaders of the Savior s Church timely counsel for our day and for our circumstances and for our challenges We have been instructed lifted edified called to repentance and strengthened The spirit of this conference has fortified our faith and fueled our desire to repent to obey to improve and to serve Like you I am eager to now act upon the reminders counsel and personal inspiration with which we have been blessed during this conference And in just a few moments each of us will receive one of the Lord s tender mercies as we hear the concluding remarks and testimony of President Gordon B Hinckley Truly the Lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works Ps 145 9 I am thankful for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith and for the knowledge we have today about the Lord s tender mercies Our desires faithfulness and obedience invite and help us to discern His mercies in our lives As one of His servants I declare my witness that Jesus is the Christ our Redeemer and our Savior I know that He lives and that His tender mercies are available to all of us Each of us can have eyes to see clearly and ears to hear distinctly the tender mercies of the Lord as they strengthen and assist us in these latter days May our hearts always be filled with gratitude for His abundant and tender mercies In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters my heart is filled to overflowing my mind is spinning my knees are weak and wobbly and I find that words are totally inadequate to communicate effectively the feelings and thoughts I desire to share with you I pray for and invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost for me and for you as I speak with you briefly this Sabbath morning In the hours since President Hinckley extended this new call to serve I have heeded the admonition of Nephi to liken all scriptures unto us 1 Ne 19 23 with a greater sense of purpose and intensity than I have ever done before I have reflected on the teaching of Paul that God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty 1 Cor 1 27 This morning I take great comfort in knowing that I am one of the truly weak things of the world I have pondered the instruction of Jacob as contained in the Book of Mormon Wherefore we search the prophets and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope and our faith becometh unshaken insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us or the mountains or the waves of the sea Nevertheless the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace and his great condescensions unto the children of men that we have power to do these things Jacob 4 6 7 Brothers and sisters please pay particular attention to the word grace as it is used in the verse I just read In the Bible Dictionary we learn that the word grace frequently is used in the scriptures to connote a strengthening or enabling power The main idea of the word is divine means of help or strength given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means This grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts p 697 Thus the enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement helps us to see and to do and to become good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity I testify and witness that the enabling power of the Savior s Atonement is real Without that strengthening power of the Atonement I could not stand before you this morning Can we sense the grace and strengthening power of Christ in the testimony of Ammon Yea I know that I am nothing as to my strength I am weak therefore I will not boast of myself but I will boast of my God for in his strength I can do all things yea behold many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land for which we will praise his name forever Alma 26 12 Truly brothers and sisters in the strength of the Lord we can do and endure and overcome all things As I walked out of the Church Administration Building after my interview with President Hinckley on Friday afternoon I recalled the words of Enoch And when Enoch had heard these words he bowed himself to the earth before the Lord and spake before the Lord saying Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight and am but a lad and all the people hate me for I am slow of speech wherefore am I thy servant And the Lord said unto Enoch Go forth and do as I have commanded thee and no man shall pierce thee Open thy mouth and it shall be filled and I will give thee utterance for all flesh is in my hands and I will do as seemeth me good Moses 6 31 32 For all of us who feel unprepared and overwhelmed and unequal to a new calling or responsibility the promise of the Lord to Enoch is equally applicable The promise was true in Enoch s day and it is true today On the night of June 20 2000 several colleagues and I were working late in the executive offices of then Ricks College in Rexburg Idaho We were making final preparations for an unexpected and historic assembly on our campus the next morning and the announcement by President Hinckley that Ricks College would become a baccalaureate degree granting institution and take on the name of Brigham Young University Idaho As an administrative team we were just beginning to realize the monumental nature of the responsibility and challenges that were before us As we walked out of the building that night one of my colleagues asked President are you scared As best as I can recall I answered something like this If I thought we had to execute this transition relying exclusively upon our own experience and our own judgment then I would be terrified But we will have help from heaven Because we know who is in charge and that we are not alone then no I am not scared And we who serve at BYU Idaho unitedly testify that there has been help from heaven miracles have occurred revelations have been received doors have been opened and we have been greatly blessed as individuals and as an institution Please permit me now to express gratitude and appreciation I am thankful for my progenitors for those faithful and steady men and women whom I respect and honor and to whom I owe everything I love and appreciate my mother and father and my wife s mother and father I am grateful for their love and support and teaching and strength My wife Susan is a virtuous woman and a righteous mother You will quickly see that purity and goodness are evident in her countenance I love her and appreciate her more than words can express I thank her for the woman she is for the lessons she has taught me and for the love we share Susan and I have been blessed with three stalwart sons I love and thank them And our growing little family now includes two righteous daughters in law and three brilliant and beautiful and charming granddaughters As we have opportunities to be together we are blessed to see just a glimpse of the family unit in eternity My dear brothers and sisters I am grateful for you As I see you assembled here in the Conference Center and envision you in meetinghouses all over the earth I am blessed by your faithfulness and devotion to the Savior As your arms were raised to the square on Saturday I felt a sustaining influence flow into my soul that was most remarkable Few of you know who I am yet you know from whom the call has come and you are so willing to sustain and support I express my thanks to you and pledge my whole soul and all of my energy to this sacred work I will go where the Lord and the leaders of His Church want me to go I will do what they want me to do I will teach what they want me to teach and I will strive to become what I should and must become In the strength of the Lord and through His grace I know that you and I can be blessed to accomplish all things As one of the weakest of the weak I testify that God lives I testify and witness that Jesus is the Christ He is our Redeemer and our Savior and He lives And I testify that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and His true Church have been restored to the earth in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith Priesthood keys and authority and saving ordinances are again found on the earth By the power of that priesthood families truly can be together forever The Book of Mormon is the word of God and the keystone of our religion And brothers and sisters the heavens are not closed God speaks to us individually and to the leaders of His latter day kingdom on earth President Gordon B Hinckley is the Lord s prophet on the earth today Of these things I testify and declare my witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen
