Throughout this general conference we have spoken and sung with joy about the fulfillment of the long ago prophesied restitution of all things 1 about bringing together in one all things in Christ 2 about the return of the fulness of the gospel priesthood and Church of Jesus Christ to the earth all of which we capture in the title the Restoration But the Restoration is not only for those of us who rejoice in it today The revelations of the First Vision were not for Joseph Smith alone but are offered as light and truth for any who lack wisdom 3 The Book of Mormon is the possession of mankind The priesthood ordinances of salvation and exaltation were prepared for every individual including those who no longer dwell in mortality The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and its blessings are intended for all who want them The gift of the Holy Ghost is meant for everyone The Restoration belongs to the world and its message is especially urgent today Wherefore how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God save it be through the merits and mercy and grace of the Holy Messiah who layeth down his life according to the flesh and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead 4From the day that the Prophet s brother Samuel Smith filled his satchel with freshly printed copies of the Book of Mormon and set out on foot to share the new scripture the Saints have labored without ceasing to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth In 1920 then Elder David O McKay of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles began a yearlong tour of the missions of the Church By May 1921 he was standing in a small cemetery in Fagali i Samoa before the well tended graves of three small children the daughter and two sons of Thomas and Sarah Hilton These little ones the oldest was two died during the time Thomas and Sarah served as a young missionary couple in the late 1800s Before he left Utah Elder McKay promised Sarah now a widow that he would visit her children s graves in Samoa as she had never been able to return there Elder McKay wrote back to her Your three little ones Sister Hilton in silence most eloquent carry on your noble missionary work begun nearly thirty years ago Then he added a verse of his own composition By loving hands their dying eyes were closed By loving hands their little limbs composed By foreign hands their humble graves adorned By strangers honor d and by strangers mourned 5This story is but one of thousands hundreds of thousands that speak of the time treasure and lives sacrificed over the last 200 years to share the message of the Restoration Our aspiration to reach every nation kindred tongue and people is undiminished today as witnessed by the tens of thousands of young men women and couples currently serving under full time mission calls by Church members generally who echo Philip s invitation to come and see 6 and by the millions of dollars spent annually to sustain this effort across the world While our invitations are without compulsion we hope people will find them compelling For that to be so I believe at least three things are required first your love second your example and third your use of the Book of Mormon Our invitations cannot be a matter of self interest rather they must be an expression of selfless love 7 This love known as charity the pure love of Christ is ours for the asking We are invited even commanded to pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that we may be filled with this love 8As an example I share an experience related by Sister Lanett Ho Ching currently serving with her husband President Francis Ho Ching who presides over the Samoa Apia Mission Sister Ho Ching relates Years ago our young family moved to a tiny home in Laie Hawaii The carport of our home had been converted into a studio apartment where a man named Jonathan lived Jonathan had been our neighbor in another place Feeling it wasn t a coincidence that the Lord had put us together we decided to be more open about our activities and membership in the Church Jonathan enjoyed our friendship and loved spending time with our family He liked learning about the gospel but he was not interested in committing to the Church In time Jonathan earned the nickname Uncle Jonathan with our children As our family continued to grow so did Jonathan s interest in our happenings Our invitations to holiday parties birthdays school events and Church activities extended to family home evenings and the children s baptisms One day I received a phone call from Jonathan He needed help He suffered from diabetes and had developed a severe foot infection that required an amputation Our family and neighboring ward members walked him through that time of trial We took turns at the hospital and priesthood blessings were offered While Jonathan was in rehab with the help of Relief Society sisters we cleaned his apartment The priesthood brethren built a ramp to his doorway and hand railings in the bathroom When Jonathan returned home he was overcome with emotion Jonathan began taking the missionary lessons again The week before New Year s he called me and asked What are you doing on New Year s Eve I reminded him about our annual party But instead he replied I want you to come to my baptism I want to start this new year right After 20 years of come and see come and help and come and stay this precious soul was ready to be baptized In 2018 when we were called to be mission president and companion Jonathan s health was declining We begged him to stay strong awaiting our return He carried on for almost a year but the Lord was preparing him to come home He passed away peacefully in April 2019 My daughters attended their Uncle Jonathan s funeral and sang the same song we sang at his baptism I introduce the second requirement for successfully sharing the message of the Restoration with this question what is it that will make your invitation appealing to someone Isn t it you the example of your life Many who have heard and received the message of the Restoration were initially attracted by what they perceived in a member or members of the Church of Jesus Christ It may have been the way they treated others the things they said or didn t say the steadiness they displayed in difficult situations or simply their countenance 9Whatever it may be we cannot escape the fact that we need to understand and live the principles of the restored gospel as best we can for our invitations to be inviting It is something often referred to today as authenticity If the love of Christ dwells in us others will know that our love for them is genuine If the light of the Holy Spirit burns within us it will rekindle the Light of Christ within them 10 What you are lends authenticity to your invitation to come experience the joy of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ The third requisite is liberal use of the instrument of conversion that God designed for this last gospel dispensation the Book of Mormon It is palpable evidence of Joseph Smith s prophetic calling and convincing evidence of the divinity and Resurrection of Jesus Christ Its exposition of our Heavenly Father s plan of redemption is unequalled When you share the Book of Mormon you share the Restoration When Jason Olson was a teenager he was warned repeatedly by family members and others against becoming a Christian He had two good friends however who were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and they often discussed religion His friends Shea and Dave respectfully countered arguments that others had given Jason against faith in Jesus Christ Finally they gave him a copy of the Book of Mormon saying This book will answer your questions Please read it He reluctantly accepted the book and put it in his backpack where it stayed for several months He didn t want to leave it at home where his family might see it and he didn t want to disappoint Shea and Dave by returning it Finally he settled on the solution of burning the book One night with a lighter in one hand and the Book of Mormon in the other he was about to set fire to the book when he heard a voice in his mind that said Do not burn my book Startled he paused Then thinking he had imagined the voice he attempted again to ignite the lighter Again the voice came to his mind Go to your room and read my book Jason put the lighter away walked back to his bedroom opened the Book of Mormon and began to read He continued day after day often into the early hours of the morning As Jason came to the end and prayed he recorded I was filled from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet with the Spirit I felt full of light It was the most joyous experience I had ever had in my life He sought baptism and later became a missionary himself Perhaps it goes without saying that despite genuine love and sincerity many if not most of our invitations to share the message of the Restoration will be declined But remember this everyone is worthy of such an invitation all are alike unto God 11 the Lord is pleased with every effort we make no matter the outcome a declined invitation is no reason for our association to end and a lack of interest today may well turn to interest tomorrow Regardless our love remains constant Let us never forget that the Restoration has come out of intense ordeal and sacrifice That is a subject for another day Today we rejoice in the fruits of the Restoration one of the most surpassing being the power once again to bind on earth and in heaven 12 As expressed years ago by President Gordon B Hinckley If nothing else came out of all of the sorrow and travail and pain of the restoration than the sealing power of the holy priesthood to bind together families forever it would have been worth all that it has cost 13The ultimate promise of the Restoration is redemption through Jesus Christ The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is the proof that He in fact possesses power to redeem all who will come unto Him redeem them from sorrow injustice regret sin and even death Today is Palm Sunday a week from today is Easter We remember we always remember Christ s suffering and death to atone for our sins and we celebrate that most wonderful of Sundays the Lord s day on which He rose from the dead Because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ the Restoration has meaning our mortal lives have meaning and ultimately our very existence has meaning Joseph Smith the great prophet of the Restoration offers the overarching testimony for our time of the resurrected Christ That he lives For we saw him even on the right hand of God 14 I humbly add my witness to Joseph s and to that of the apostles and prophets before him and the apostles and prophets who have succeeded him that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Messiah the Only Begotten Son of God and the resurrected Redeemer of all mankind We testify that those who prayerfully study the message of the Restoration and act in faith will be blessed to gain their own witness of its divinity and of its purpose to prepare the world for the promised Second Coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 15 Christ s Resurrection makes His promises sure In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Book of Mormon prophet Enos Lehi s grandson wrote of a singular experience that happened earlier in his life While hunting alone in the forest Enos began pondering on the teachings of his father Jacob He related The words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life and the joy of the saints sunk deep into my heart 1 In the spiritual hunger of his soul Enos knelt in prayer a remarkable prayer that lasted through the day and into the night a prayer that brought him crucial revelations assurances and promises There is much to be learned from Enos s experience but today what stands out in my mind is Enos s memory of his father speaking often of the joy of the saints In this conference three years ago President Russell M Nelson spoke of joy 2 Among other things he said The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives When the focus of our lives is on God s plan of salvation and Jesus Christ and His gospel we can feel joy regardless of what is happening or not happening in our lives Joy comes from and because of Him For Latter day Saints Jesus Christ is joy 3Saints are those who have entered into the gospel covenant through baptism and are striving to follow Christ as His disciples 4 Thus the joy of the saints denotes the joy of becoming Christlike I would like to speak of the joy that comes from keeping His commandments the joy that arises from overcoming sorrow and weakness through Him and the joy inherent in serving as He served The Joy of Keeping Christ s CommandmentsWe live in a hedonistic age when many question the importance of the Lord s commandments or simply ignore them Not infrequently people who flout divine directives such as the law of chastity the standard of honesty and the holiness of the Sabbath seem to prosper and enjoy the good things of life at times even more so than those who are striving to be obedient Some begin to wonder if the effort and sacrifices are worth it The ancient people of Israel once complained It is vain to serve God and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts And now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt God are even delivered 5Just wait said the Lord until that day when I make up my jewels Then shall ye discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not 6 The wicked may have joy in their works for a season but it is always temporary 7 The joy of the Saints is enduring God sees things in their true perspective and He shares that perspective with us through His commandments effectively guiding us around the pitfalls and potholes of mortality toward eternal joy The Prophet Joseph Smith explained When His commandments teach us it is in view of eternity for we are looked upon by God as though we were in eternity God dwells in eternity and does not view things as we do 8I haven t met anyone who found the gospel later in life who didn t wish it could have been earlier Oh the poor choices and mistakes I could have avoided they will say The Lord s commandments are our guide to better choices and happier outcomes How we ought to rejoice and thank Him for showing us this more excellent way As a teenager Sister Kalombo Rosette Kamwanya from the D R Congo now serving in the C te d Ivoire Abidjan West Mission fasted and prayed for three days to find the direction God wanted her to take In a remarkable night vision she was shown two buildings a chapel and what she now realizes was a temple She began to search and soon found the chapel she had seen in her dream The sign said The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Sister Kamwanya was baptized and then her mother and her six brothers Sister Kamwanya said When I received the gospel I felt like a captured bird that had been liberated My heart was filled with joy I had the assurance that God loves me 9Keeping the Lord s commandments enables us more fully and more easily to feel His love The strait and narrow path of the commandments leads directly to the tree of life and the tree and its fruit the sweetest and most desirable above all things 10 are a representation of the love of God and fill the soul with exceedingly great joy 11 Said the Savior If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as I have kept my Father s commandments and abide in his love These things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full 12The Joy of Overcoming through ChristEven when we are found faithfully keeping the commandments there are trials and tragedies that could interrupt our joy But as we strive to overcome these challenges with the Savior s help it preserves both the joy we feel now and the joy we anticipate Christ reassured His disciples In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 13 It is in turning to Him obeying Him binding ourselves to Him that trial and sorrow are turned to joy I mention one example In 1989 Jack Rushton was serving as president of the Irvine California Stake in the United States During a family vacation on the California coast Jack was bodysurfing when a wave swept him into a submerged rock breaking his neck and severely injuring his spinal cord Jack said later The instant I hit I knew that I was paralyzed 14 He could no longer talk or even breathe on his own 15Family friends and stake members rallied around Brother Rushton and his wife Jo Anne and among other things remodeled a section of their home to accommodate Jack s wheelchair Jo Anne became Jack s principal caregiver for the next 23 years Referring to Book of Mormon accounts of how the Lord visited His people in their afflictions and made their burdens light 16 Jo Anne said I am often amazed at the lightness of heart I feel in caring for my husband 17An alteration to his respiration system restored Jack s ability to speak and within the year Jack was called as Gospel Doctrine teacher and stake patriarch When he would give a patriarchal blessing another priesthood holder placed Brother Rushton s hand on the head of the person receiving the blessing and supported his hand and arm during the blessing Jack passed away on Christmas Day 2012 after 22 years of devoted service Once in an interview Jack observed Problems will come into all of our lives it s part of just being here upon this earth And some people think that religion or having faith in God will protect you from bad things I don t think that s the point I think the point is that if our faith is strong that when bad things happen which they will we ll be able to deal with them My faith never wavered but that didn t mean that I didn t have depressions I think for the first time in my life I was pushed to the limit and literally there was nowhere to turn and so I turned to the Lord and to this day I feel a spontaneity of joy 18This is a day of sometimes merciless attacks in social media and in person against those who seek to uphold the Lord s standard in dress entertainment and sexual purity It is often the youth and young adults among the Saints as well as women and mothers who bear this cross of mocking and persecution It is not easy to rise above such abuse but remember the words of Peter If ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified 19In the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve were in a state of innocence having no joy for they knew no misery 20 Now as accountable beings we find joy in overcoming misery in whatever form whether it be sin trial weakness or any other obstacle to happiness This is the joy of sensing progress in the path of discipleship the joy of having received a remission of sins and having peace of conscience 21 the joy of feeling one s soul expand and grow through the grace of Christ 22The Joy of Serving as Christ ServesThe Savior finds joy in bringing to pass our immortality and eternal life 23 In speaking of the Savior s Atonement President Russell M Nelson said As in all things Jesus Christ is our ultimate exemplar who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross Hebrews 12 2 Think of that In order for Him to endure the most excruciating experience ever endured on earth our Savior focused on joy And what was the joy that was set before Him Surely it included the joy of cleansing healing and strengthening us the joy of paying for the sins of all who would repent the joy of making it possible for you and me to return home clean and worthy to live with our Heavenly Parents and families 24Similarly the joy set before us is the joy of assisting the Savior in His work of redemption As the seed and children of Abraham 25 we participate in blessing all the families of the earth with the blessings of the Gospel which are the blessings of salvation even of life eternal 26The words of Alma come to mind This is my glory that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance and this is my joy And behold when I see many of my brethren truly penitent and coming to the Lord their God then is my soul filled with joy But I do not joy in my own success alone but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren who have been up to the land of Nephi Now when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is carried away even to the separation of it from the body as it were so great is my joy 27The fruits of our service to one another in the Church are part of the joy set before us Even in times of discouragement or stress we can minister patiently if we are focused on the joy of pleasing God and bringing light relief and happiness to His children our brothers and sisters When in Haiti last month for the dedication of the Port au Prince Temple Elder David and Sister Susan Bednar met with a young sister whose husband had been killed a few days earlier in a tragic accident They wept together with her Yet on Sunday this dear woman was in her place as an usher at the dedication services with a soft welcoming smile for all who entered the temple I believe that the ultimate joy of the saints comes in knowing that the Savior pleads their cause 28 and no one can conceive of the joy which will fill our souls as we hear Jesus pray for us unto the Father 29 With President Russell M Nelson I testify that joy is a gift for faithful Saints who have endured the crosses of the world 30 and who are intentionally trying to live a righteous life as taught by Jesus Christ 31 May your joy be full I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In two weeks we will celebrate Easter The Resurrection confirms the divinity of Jesus Christ and the reality of God the Father Our thoughts turn to the Savior and we ponder His matchless life and the infinite virtue of His great atoning sacrifice 1 I hope we also think about His pending return when He will rule as King of Kings and Lord of Lords 2Some time ago in Buenos Aires Argentina I participated in a conference with leaders from a wide variety of religious faiths Their love for their fellowman was unmistakable They were intent on relieving suffering and helping people rise above oppression and poverty I reflected on the numerous humanitarian undertakings of this Church including projects in collaboration with a number of the faith groups represented in the conference I felt deep gratitude for the generosity of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints that makes such Christlike service possible In that moment the Holy Spirit affirmed two things to me First the work of ministering to temporal needs is vital and must continue The second was unexpected yet powerful and clear It was this beyond selfless service it is supremely important to prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ When He comes oppression and injustice will not only diminish they will cease The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and fatling together and a little child shall lead them They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea 3Poverty and suffering will not only decline they will vanish They shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes 4Even the pain and sorrow of death will be done away In that day an infant shall not die until he is old and his life shall be as the age of a tree And when he dies he shall not sleep that is to say in the earth but shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye and shall be caught up and his rest shall be glorious 5So yes let us do all we can to relieve suffering and sorrow now and let us devote ourselves more diligently to the preparations needed for the day when pain and evil are ended altogether when Christ shall reign personally upon the earth and the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory 6 It will be a day of redemption and judgment The former Anglican Bishop of Durham Dr N T Wright has aptly described the significance of Christ s Atonement Resurrection and Judgment in overcoming injustice and putting all things right He said God has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged rightly by a man whom he has appointed and of this he has given assurance to all by raising this man from the dead The facts about Jesus of Nazareth and especially about his resurrection from the dead are the foundation of the assurance that the world is not random It is not ultimately a chaos that when we do justice in the present we are not whistling in the dark trying to shore up a building that will ultimately collapse or to fix a car which is actually bound for the scrap heap When God raised Jesus from the dead that was the microcosmic event in which the ultimate macrocosmic act of judgment was contained in a nutshell the seed of the ultimate hope God declared in the most powerful way imaginable that Jesus of Nazareth really was the Messiah In the greatest irony of history Jesus himself underwent cruel and unjust judgment coming to the place which symbolized and drew together all the myriad cruelties and injustices of history to bear that chaos that darkness that cruelty that injustice in himself and to exhaust its power 7While I was at the conference in Buenos Aires that I mentioned earlier the Spirit made clear to me that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is uniquely empowered and commissioned to accomplish the necessary preparations for the Lord s Second Coming indeed it was restored for that purpose Can you find anywhere else a people who embrace the present era as the prophesied dispensation of the fulness of times in which God has purposed to gather together in one all things in Christ 8 If you don t find here a community intent on accomplishing what needs to be accomplished for both the living and the dead to prepare for that day if you don t find here an organization willing to commit vast amounts of time and funds to the gathering and preparation of a covenant people ready to receive the Lord you won t find it anywhere Speaking to the Church in 1831 the Lord declared The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth Call upon the Lord that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth that the inhabitants thereof may receive it and be prepared for the days to come in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven clothed in the brightness of his glory to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth 9What can we do to prepare now for that day We can prepare ourselves as a people we can gather the Lord s covenant people and we can help redeem the promise of salvation made to the fathers our ancestors 10 All of this must occur in some substantial measure before the Lord comes again First and crucial for the Lord s return is the presence on the earth of a people prepared to receive Him at His coming He has stated that those who remain upon the earth in that day from the least to the greatest shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord and shall see eye to eye and shall lift up their voice and with the voice together sing this new song saying The Lord hath brought again Zion The Lord hath gathered all things in one The Lord hath brought down Zion from above The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath 11In ancient times God took the righteous city of Zion to Himself 12 By contrast in the last days a new Zion will receive the Lord at His return 13 Zion is the pure in heart a people of one heart and one mind dwelling in righteousness with no poor among them 14 The Prophet Joseph Smith stated We ought to have the building up of Zion as our greatest object 15 We build up Zion in our homes wards branches and stakes through unity godliness and charity 16We must acknowledge that the building up of Zion occurs in tumultuous times a day of wrath a day of burning a day of desolation of weeping of mourning and of lamentation and as a whirlwind it shall come upon all the face of the earth saith the Lord 17 Thus the gathering into stakes becomes for a defense and for a refuge from the storm and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth 18Just as in former times we meet together oft to fast and to pray and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of our souls And to partake of bread and water in remembrance of the Lord Jesus 19 As President Russell M Nelson explained in general conference last October The long standing objective of the Church is to assist all members to increase their faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and in His Atonement to assist them in making and keeping their covenants with God and to strengthen and seal their families 20 Accordingly he emphasizes the significance of temple covenants hallowing the Sabbath and a daily feasting upon the gospel centered at home and supported by an integrated study curriculum at church We want to know about the Lord and we want to know the Lord 21An underlying effort in building Zion is the gathering of the Lord s long dispersed covenant people 22 We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes 23 All who will repent believe on Christ and be baptized are His covenant people 24 The Lord Himself prophesied that before His return the gospel would be preached in all the world25 to recover His people which are of the house of Israel 26 and then shall the end come 27 Jeremiah s prophecy is being fulfilled Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord that they shall no more say The Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt But The Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands whither he had driven them and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers 28President Nelson has repeatedly emphasized that the gathering of Israel is the most important thing taking place on earth today Nothing else compares in magnitude nothing else compares in importance nothing else compares in majesty And if you choose to you can be a big part of it 29 The Latter day Saints have always been a missionary people Hundreds of thousands have responded to mission calls since the beginning of the Restoration tens of thousands currently serve And as Elder Quentin L Cook has just taught all of us can participate in simple and natural ways in love inviting others to join us at church visit in our homes become part of our circle Publication of the Book of Mormon was the signal that the gathering had begun 30 The Book of Mormon itself is the instrument of gathering and conversion Also vital to the preparation for the Second Coming is the great redemptive effort on behalf of our ancestors The Lord promised to send Elijah the prophet before the Second Coming the great and dreadful day of the Lord 31 to reveal the Priesthood and plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers 32 Elijah did come as promised The date was April 3 1836 the place was the Kirtland Temple In that place and in that moment he did indeed confer the promised priesthood the keys for the redemption of the dead and the union of husbands wives and families across all generations of time and throughout all eternity 33 Without this the purpose of creation would be frustrated and in that sense the earth would be cursed or utterly wasted 34At the youth devotional preceding the dedication of the Rome Italy Temple the hundreds of young men and women in attendance displayed to President Nelson the cards they had prepared with names of their ancestors They were ready to enter the temple to perform vicarious baptisms for those ancestors as soon as it opened It was a supremely gratifying moment yet but one example of the accelerating effort to establish Zion for the generations that have gone before While we strive to be diligent in building up Zion including our part in the gathering of the Lord s elect and the redemption of the dead we should pause to remember that it is the Lord s work and He is doing it He is the Lord of the vineyard and we are His servants He bids us labor in the vineyard with our might this last time and He labors with us 35 It would probably be more accurate to say He permits us to labor with Him As Paul said I have planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase 36 It is He who is hastening His work in its time 37 Employing our admittedly imperfect efforts our small means the Lord brings about great things 38This great and last dispensation is building steadily to its climax Zion on earth being joined with Zion from above at the Savior s glorious return The Church of Jesus Christ is commissioned to prepare and is preparing the world for that day And so this Easter let us truly celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and all that it portends His return to reign for a thousand years of peace a righteous judgment and perfect justice for all the immortality of all who ever lived upon this earth and the promise of eternal life Christ s Resurrection is the ultimate assurance that all will be put right Let us be about building up Zion to hasten that day In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In Old Testament history we read of successive periods when the children of Israel honored their covenant with Jehovah and worshipped Him and other times when they ignored that covenant and worshipped idols or Baalim 1The reign of Ahab was one of the periods of apostasy in the northern kingdom of Israel The prophet Elijah on one occasion told King Ahab to gather the people of Israel as well as the prophets or priests of Baal at Mount Carmel When the people had come together Elijah said unto them How long halt ye between two opinions or in other words When will you decide once and for all if the Lord be God follow him but if Baal then follow him And the people answered him not a word 2 So Elijah directed that both he and Baal s prophets cut up a young bull and place it on a bed of wood on their respective altars but put no fire under 3 Then Call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the God that answereth by fire let him be God And all the people answered and said It is well spoken 4You will recall that the priests of Baal clamored to their nonexistent god for hours to send down fire but there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded 5 When it was Elijah s turn he repaired the broken down altar of the Lord laid the wood and the offering upon it and then ordered that it all be doused with water not once but three times There was no doubt that neither he nor any other human power could light the fire And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench And when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said The Lord he is the God the Lord he is the God 6Today Elijah might say Either God our Heavenly Father exists or He does not but if He exists worship Him Either Jesus Christ is the Son of God the resurrected Redeemer of mankind or He is not but if He is follow Him Either the Book of Mormon is the word of God or it is not but if it is then get nearer to God by studying and abiding by its precepts 7Either Joseph Smith saw and conversed with the Father and the Son that spring day of 1820 or he did not but if he did then follow the prophetic mantle including the keys of sealing that I Elijah bestowed upon him In the most recent general conference President Russell M Nelson declared You don t have to wonder about what is true see Moroni 10 5 You do not have to wonder whom you can safely trust Through personal revelation you can receive your own witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that this is the Lord s Church Regardless of what others may say or do no one can ever take away a witness borne to your heart and mind about what is true 8When James promised that God giveth to all men liberally who seek His wisdom 9 he also cautioned But let him ask in faith nothing wavering For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord A double minded man is unstable in all his ways 10Our Savior on the other hand was the perfect example of stability He said The Father hath not left me alone for I do always those things that please him 11 Consider these descriptions from the scriptures of men and women who like the Savior were firm and steadfast They were converted unto the true faith and they would not depart from it for they were firm and steadfast and immovable willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord 12 Their minds are firm and they do put their trust in God continually 13 And behold ye do know of yourselves for ye have witnessed it that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth are firm and steadfast in the faith and in the thing wherewith they have been made free 14 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers 15To persevere firm and steadfast in the faith of Christ requires that the gospel of Jesus Christ penetrate one s heart and soul meaning that the gospel becomes not just one of many influences in a person s life but the defining focus of his or her life and character The Lord says A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of flesh And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them And ye shall be my people and I will be your God 16This is the covenant we make by our baptism and in temple ordinances But some have not yet fully received the gospel of Jesus Christ into their lives Although as Paul says they were buried with Christ by baptism they are still missing the part that like as Christ was raised up from the dead even so we should walk in a newness of life 17 The gospel does not yet define them They are not yet centered in Christ They are selective about the doctrines and commandments they will follow and where and when they will serve in the Church By contrast it is in keeping their covenants with exactness that those who are the elect according to the covenant 18 avoid deception and remain firm in the faith of Christ Most of us find ourselves at this moment on a continuum between a socially motivated participation in gospel rituals on the one hand and a fully developed Christlike commitment to the will of God on the other Somewhere along that continuum the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ enters into our heart and takes possession of our soul It may not happen in an instant but we should all be moving toward that blessed state It is challenging but vital to remain firm and steadfast when we find ourselves being refined in the furnace of affliction 19 something that comes soon or late to all of us in mortality Without God these dark experiences tend to despondency despair and even bitterness With God comfort replaces pain peace replaces turmoil and hope replaces sorrow Remaining firm in the faith of Christ will bring His sustaining grace and support 20 He will convert trial into blessing and in Isaiah s words give beauty for ashes 21May I mention three examples of which I have personal knowledge There is a woman who suffers with a debilitating chronic illness that persists despite medical attention priesthood blessings and fasting and prayers Nevertheless her faith in the power of prayer and the reality of God s love for her is undiminished She presses ahead day by day and sometimes hour by hour serving as called in the Church and together with her husband looking after her young family smiling as much as she can Her compassion for others runs deep refined by her own suffering and she often loses herself in ministering to others She continues steadfast and people feel happy being around her A man who grew up in the Church served as a full time missionary and married a lovely woman was surprised when some of his siblings began speaking critically of the Church and the Prophet Joseph Smith After a time they left the Church and tried to persuade him to follow As often happens in such cases they bombarded him with essays podcasts and videos produced by critics most of whom were themselves disaffected former members of the Church His siblings mocked his faith telling him he was gullible and misled He didn t have answers for all their assertions and his faith began to waver under the relentless opposition He wondered if he should stop attending church He talked with his wife He talked with people he trusted He prayed As he meditated in this troubled state of mind he recalled occasions when he had felt the Holy Spirit and had received a witness of truth by the Spirit He concluded If I am honest with myself I must admit that the Spirit has touched me more than once and the testimony of the Spirit is real He has a renewed sense of happiness and peace that is shared by his wife and children A husband and wife who have consistently and happily followed the counsel of the Brethren in their lives were grieved by the difficulty they experienced in having children They expended substantial funds working with competent medical professionals and after a time they were blessed with a son Tragically however after only about a year the baby was the victim of an accident that was no one s fault but that left him semicomatose with significant brain damage He has received the best of care but doctors cannot predict how things will unfold going forward The child this couple worked and prayed so hard to bring into the world has in a sense been taken away and they don t know if he will be returned to them They struggle now to care for their baby s critical needs while meeting their other responsibilities In this supremely difficult moment they have turned to the Lord They rely on the daily bread they receive from Him They are aided by compassionate friends and family and strengthened by priesthood blessings They have drawn closer to one another their union perhaps now deeper and more complete than might otherwise have been possible On July 23 1837 the Lord directed a revelation to the then President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Thomas B Marsh It included the following And pray for thy brethren of the Twelve Admonish them sharply for my name s sake and let them be admonished for all their sins and be ye faithful before me unto my name And after their temptations and much tribulation behold I the Lord will feel after them and if they harden not their hearts and stiffen not their necks against me they shall be converted and I will heal them 22I believe the principles expressed in these verses apply to all of us The temptations and tribulations we experience plus any testing that the Lord sees fit to impose can lead to our full conversion and healing But this happens if and only if we do not harden our hearts or stiffen our necks against Him If we remain firm and steadfast come what may we achieve the conversion the Savior intended when He said to Peter When thou art converted strengthen thy brethren 23 a conversion so complete that it cannot be undone The promised healing is the cleansing and sanctification of our sin wounded souls making us holy I am reminded of our mothers counsel Eat your vegetables it will do you good Our mothers are right and in the context of steadfastness in the faith eating your vegetables is to pray constantly to feast on the scriptures daily to serve and worship in the Church to worthily take the sacrament each week to love your neighbor and to take up your cross in obedience to God each day 24Always remember the promise of good things to come both now and hereafter for those who are firm and steadfast in the faith of Christ Remember eternal life and the joy of the saints 25 O all ye that are pure in heart lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God and feast upon his love for ye may if your minds are firm forever 26 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Not long after the Church was organized in this last dispensation the Lord stated in a revelation And by the prayer of your faith ye shall receive my law that ye may know how to govern my church and have all things right before me 1 This principle has been followed in the Church and that promise has been honored by the Lord ever since Patterns for priesthood organization and service have been revealed from time to time beginning with the Prophet Joseph Smith when priesthood offices and quorums were established in our day Significant refinements were revealed and implemented during the tenures of Presidents Brigham Young John Taylor and Spencer W Kimball among others with respect to the Quorum of the Twelve the Seventy high priests and other offices and quorums in both the Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthoods 2 Now in a historic statement just moments ago President Russell M Nelson announced a further crucial adjustment If I may repeat some of his statement Tonight we announce a significant restructuring of our Melchizedek Priesthood quorums to accomplish the work of the Lord more effectively In each ward the high priests and the elders will now be combined into one elders quorum and the composition of the stake high priests quorum will be based on current priesthood callings President Nelson added These modifications have been under study for many months We have felt a pressing need to improve the way we care for our members To do that better we need to strengthen our priesthood quorums to give greater direction to the ministering of love and support that the Lord intends for His Saints These adjustments are inspired of the Lord As we implement them we will be even more effective than we have ever been previously 3At the First Presidency s direction Elder Ronald A Rasband and I will add some detail that we trust will respond to questions you may have Elders and High Priests QuorumsFirst to reiterate what are the adjustments for ward high priests groups and elders quorums In wards members of elders quorums and high priests groups will now be combined into one Melchizedek Priesthood quorum with one quorum presidency This quorum increased in numbers and unity will be designated the elders quorum High priests groups are discontinued The elders quorum includes all elders and prospective elders in the ward as well as high priests who are not currently serving in the bishopric in the stake presidency on the high council or as functioning patriarchs The high priests quorum in the stake will be composed of those high priests who are serving in the stake presidency in bishoprics on the high council and as functioning patriarchs The Elders Quorum PresidencyHow is the presidency of the elders quorum to be organized The stake presidency will release current high priests group leaderships and elders quorum presidencies and will call a new elders quorum president and counselors in each ward The new elders quorum presidency may include elders and high priests of varying ages and experience serving together in one quorum presidency An elder or a high priest may serve as the quorum president or as a counselor in the presidency This is not a takeover of elders quorums by high priests We expect elders and high priests to work together in any combination in the quorum presidency and in quorum service These quorum adjustments should be implemented as soon as conveniently possible Priesthood Offices in the Elders QuorumDoes this adjustment in quorum structure change the priesthood office held by quorum members No this action does not rescind any priesthood office to which any quorum member may have been ordained in the past As you know a man may be ordained to different priesthood offices over his lifetime and he does not lose or forfeit any prior ordination when he receives a new one While in some instances a priesthood bearer may serve in more than one office at a time as when a high priest also serves as a patriarch or as a bishop he typically does not function in all his priesthood offices at the same time Bishops and Seventies for instance do not actively serve in those offices once they are released or made emeritus Thus whatever other priesthood office or offices a man may hold while he is a member of the elders quorum he serves as an elder Years ago President Boyd K Packer observed that the priesthood is greater than any of its offices The priesthood is not divisible An elder holds as much priesthood as an Apostle See D C 20 38 When a man has the priesthood conferred upon him he receives all of it However there are offices within the priesthood divisions of authority and responsibility Sometimes one office is spoken of as being higher than or lower than another office Rather than higher or lower offices in the Melchizedek Priesthood represent different areas of service 4 Brethren I devoutly hope that we will no longer speak in terms of being advanced to another office in the Melchizedek Priesthood Elders will continue to be ordained high priests when they are called to a stake presidency high council or bishopric or at other times as determined by the stake president through prayerful consideration and inspiration When their terms of service in a stake presidency high council or bishopric are completed high priests will rejoin the elders quorum in their ward Direction for the Elders Quorum PresidentWho directs the work of the elders quorum president The stake president presides over the Melchizedek Priesthood in his stake Therefore the elders quorum president is directly responsible to the stake president who provides training and guidance from the stake presidency and through the high council The bishop as the presiding high priest in the ward also meets regularly with the elders quorum president The bishop counsels with him and gives appropriate direction regarding how best to serve and bless ward members working in harmony with all ward organizations 5The Purpose of These ChangesWhat are the purposes of the adjustments to Melchizedek Priesthood quorums Having one Melchizedek Priesthood quorum in a ward unifies priesthood holders to accomplish all aspects of the work of salvation including the temple and family history work previously coordinated by the high priests groups It allows quorum members of all ages and backgrounds to benefit from the perspective and experience of one another and of those in different stages of life It also provides additional opportunities for experienced priesthood holders to mentor others including prospective elders new members young adults and those returning to Church activity I cannot adequately express how excited I am to contemplate the increasingly vital role that elders quorums will play in the future The wisdom experience capacity and strength that will be found in these quorums portend a new day and a new standard of priesthood service across the Church Twenty years ago in general conference I related a story first told by Elder Vaughn J Featherstone of the Seventy that I believe bears repeating here In 1918 Brother George Goates was a farmer who raised sugar beets in Lehi Utah Winter came early that year and froze much of his beet crop in the ground For George and his young son Francis the harvest was slow and difficult Meanwhile an influenza epidemic was raging The dreaded disease claimed the lives of George s son Charles and three of Charles s small children two little girls and a boy In the course of only six days a grieving George Goates made three separate trips to Ogden Utah to bring the bodies home for burial At the end of this terrible interlude George and Francis hitched up their wagon and headed back to the beet field On the way they passed wagon after wagon load of beets being hauled to the factory and driven by neighborhood farmers As they passed by each driver would wave a greeting Hi ya Uncle George Sure sorry George Tough break George You ve got a lot of friends George On the last wagon was freckled faced Jasper Rolfe He waved a cheery greeting and called out That s all of em Uncle George Brother Goates turned to Francis and said I wish it was all of ours When they arrived at the farm gate Francis jumped down off the big red beet wagon and opened the gate as his father drove onto the field George pulled up stopped the team and scanned the field There wasn t a sugar beet on the whole field Then it dawned upon him what Jasper Rolfe meant when he called out That s all of em Uncle George George got down off the wagon picked up a handful of the rich brown soil he loved so much and then a beet top and he looked for a moment at these symbols of his labor as if he couldn t believe his eyes Then he sat down on a pile of beet tops this man who brought four of his loved ones home for burial in the course of only six days made caskets dug graves and even helped with the burial clothing this amazing man who never faltered nor flinched nor wavered throughout this agonizing ordeal sat down on a pile of beet tops and sobbed like a little child Then he arose wiped his eyes looked up at the sky and said Thanks Father for the elders of our ward 6Yes thanks be to God for the men of the priesthood and for the service they will yet render in lifting individuals and families and in establishing Zion The First Presidency the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the Presidency of the Seventy have considered these adjustments over an extended period of time With much prayer careful study of the scriptural foundations of priesthood quorums and confirmation that this is the Lord s will we are moving forward with unanimity in what is in reality one more step in the unfolding of the Restoration The Lord s direction is manifest and I rejoice in it as I bear witness of Him His priesthood and your ordinations in that priesthood in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The day after Jesus miraculously fed the 5 000 in Galilee with only five barley loaves and two small fishes 1 He spoke to the people again in Capernaum The Savior perceived that many were not so much interested in His teachings as they were in being fed again 2 Accordingly He tried to convince them of the immensely greater value of that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you 3 Jesus declared I am that bread of life Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world 4The Savior s intended meaning was totally lost on His hearers who understood His statement only literally Recoiling at the thought they wondered How can this man give us his flesh to eat 5 Jesus pressed the point further Verily verily I say unto you Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day For my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed 6He then expressed the profound meaning of His metaphor He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me 7Still His hearers did not grasp what Jesus was saying and many when they had heard this said This is an hard saying who can hear it And from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him 8To eat His flesh and drink His blood is a striking way of expressing how completely we must bring the Savior into our life into our very being that we may be one How does this happen First we understand that in sacrificing His flesh and blood Jesus atoned for our sins and overcame death both physical and spiritual 9 Clearly then we partake of His flesh and drink His blood when we receive from Him the power and blessings of His Atonement The doctrine of Christ expresses what we must do to receive atoning grace It is to believe and have faith in Christ to repent and be baptized and to receive the Holy Ghost and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost 10 This is the gate our access to the Savior s atoning grace and to the strait and narrow path leading to His kingdom Wherefore if ye shall press forward on that path feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life Behold this is the doctrine of Christ and the only and true doctrine of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost which is one God without end 11The symbolism of the sacrament of the Lord s Supper is beautiful to contemplate The bread and water represent the flesh and blood of Him who is the Bread of Life and the Living Water 12 poignantly reminding us of the price He paid to redeem us As the bread is broken we remember the Savior s torn flesh Elder Dallin H Oaks once observed that because it is broken and torn each piece of bread is unique just as the individuals who partake of it are unique We all have different sins to repent of We all have different needs to be strengthened through the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ whom we remember in this ordinance 13 As we drink the water we think of the blood He shed in Gethsemane and on the cross and its sanctifying power 14 Knowing that no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom we resolve to be among those who have washed their garments in the Savior s blood because of their faith and the repentance of all their sins and their faithfulness unto the end 15I have spoken of receiving the Savior s atoning grace to take away our sins and the stain of those sins in us But figuratively eating His flesh and drinking His blood has a further meaning and that is to internalize the qualities and character of Christ putting off the natural man and becoming Saints through the atonement of Christ the Lord 16 As we partake of the sacramental bread and water each week we would do well to consider how fully and completely we must incorporate His character and the pattern of His sinless life into our life and being Jesus could not have atoned for the sins of others unless He Himself was sinless Since justice had no claim on Him He could offer Himself in our place to satisfy justice and then extend mercy As we remember and honor His atoning sacrifice we should also contemplate His sinless life This suggests the need for a mighty striving on our part We cannot be content to remain as we are but must be moving constantly toward the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ 17 Like King Lamoni s father in the Book of Mormon we must be willing to give away all our sins18 and focus on what the Lord expects of us individually and together Not long ago a friend recounted to me an experience he had while serving as a mission president He had undergone a surgery that required several weeks of recuperation During his recovery he devoted time to searching the scriptures One afternoon as he pondered the Savior s words in the 27th chapter of 3 Nephi he drifted off to sleep He subsequently related I fell into a dream in which I was given a vivid panoramic view of my life I was shown my sins poor choices the times I had treated people with impatience plus the omissions of good things I should have said or done A comprehensive review of my life was shown to me in just a few minutes but it seemed much longer I awoke startled and instantly dropped to my knees beside the bed and began to pray to plead for forgiveness pouring out the feelings of my heart like I had never done previously Prior to the dream I didn t know that I had such great need to repent My faults and weaknesses suddenly became so plainly clear to me that the gap between the person I was and the holiness and goodness of God seemed like millions of miles In my prayer that late afternoon I expressed my deepest gratitude to Heavenly Father and to the Savior with my whole heart for what They had done for me and for the relationships I treasured with my wife and children While on my knees I also felt God s love and mercy that was so palpable despite my feeling so unworthy I can say I haven t been the same since that day My heart changed What followed is that I developed more empathy toward others with a greater capacity to love coupled with a sense of urgency to preach the gospel I could relate to the messages of faith hope and the gift of repentance found in the Book of Mormon as never before 19It is important to recognize that this good man s vivid revelation of his sins and shortcomings did not discourage him or lead him to despair Yes he felt shock and remorse He felt keenly his need to repent He had been humbled yet he felt gratitude peace and hope real hope because of Jesus Christ the living bread which came down from heaven 20My friend spoke of the gap he perceived in his dream between his life and the holiness of God Holiness is the right word To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ means to pursue holiness God commands Be ye holy for I am holy 21Enoch counseled us Teach it unto your children that all men everywhere must repent or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God for no unclean thing can dwell there or dwell in his presence for in the language of Adam Man of Holiness is his name and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man even Jesus Christ 22 As a boy I wondered why in the New Testament Jesus is often referred to and even refers to Himself as the Son of Man when He is really the Son of God but Enoch s statement makes it clear that these references are actually a recognition of His divinity and holiness He is the Son of Man of Holiness God the Father If we yearn to dwell in Christ and have Him dwell in us 23 then holiness is what we seek in both body and spirit 24 We seek it in the temple whereon is inscribed Holiness to the Lord We seek it in our marriages families and homes We seek it each week as we delight in the Lord s holy day 25 We seek it even in the details of daily living our speech our dress our thoughts As President Thomas S Monson has stated We are the product of all we read all we view all we hear and all we think 26 We seek holiness as we take up our cross daily 27Sister Carol F McConkie has observed We recognize the multitude of tests temptations and tribulations that could pull us away from all that is virtuous and praiseworthy before God But our mortal experiences offer us the opportunity to choose holiness Most often it is the sacrifices we make to keep our covenants that sanctify us and make us holy 28 And to the sacrifices we make I would add the service we give We know that when we are in the service of our fellow beings we are only in the service of our God 29 And the Lord reminds us that such service is central to His life and character For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many 30 President Marion G Romney wisely explained Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made 31Zechariah prophesied that in the day of the Lord s millennial reign even the bells of the horses would bear the inscription Holiness unto the Lord 32 In that spirit the pioneer Saints in these valleys affixed that reminder Holiness to the Lord on seemingly common or mundane things as well as those more directly associated with religious practice It was inscribed on sacrament cups and plates and printed on certificates of ordination of Seventies and on a Relief Society banner Holiness to the Lord also appeared over the display windows of Zion s Cooperative Mercantile Institution the ZCMI department store It was found on the head of a hammer and on a drum Holiness to the Lord was cast on the metal doorknobs of President Brigham Young s home These references to holiness in seemingly unusual or unexpected places may seem incongruous but they suggest just how pervasive and constant our focus on holiness needs to be Partaking of the Savior s flesh and drinking His blood means to put out of our lives anything inconsistent with a Christlike character and to make His attributes our own This is the larger meaning of repentance not only a turning away from past sin but also a turning of the heart and will to God 33 going forward As happened with my friend in his revelatory dream God will show us our flaws and failings but He will also help us turn weakness into strength 34 If we sincerely ask What lack I yet 35 He will not leave us to guess but in love He will answer for the sake of our happiness And He will give us hope It is a consuming endeavor and it would be terribly daunting if in our striving for holiness we were alone The glorious truth is we are not alone We have the love of God the grace of Christ the comfort and guidance of the Holy Spirit and the fellowship and encouragement of fellow Saints in the body of Christ Let us not be content with where we are but neither let us be discouraged As a simple but thoughtful hymn urges us Take time to be holy the world rushes on spend much time in secret with Jesus alone By looking to Jesus like him thou shalt be thy friends in thy conduct his likeness shall see 36I bear testimony of Jesus Christ the living bread which came down from heaven 37 and that whoso eateth His flesh and drinketh His blood hath eternal life 38 in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The prophet Ezekiel was born about two decades before Lehi and his family left Jerusalem In 597 BC at age 25 Ezekiel was one of the many carried captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar and as best we can tell he spent the rest of his life there 1 He was of the Aaronic priestly lineage and when he was 30 he became a prophet 2In commissioning Ezekiel Jehovah used the metaphor of a watchman If when the watchman seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head 3On the other hand if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them his blood will I require at the watchman s hand 4Then speaking directly to Ezekiel Jehovah declared So thou O son of man I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them for me 5 The warning was to turn away from sin When I say unto the wicked O wicked man thou shalt surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand Nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul Again when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live 6Interestingly this warning also applies to the righteous When I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteous deeds shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it 7Pleading with His children God tells Ezekiel Say unto them As I live saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die O house of Israel 8Far from being anxious to condemn our Heavenly Father and our Savior seek our happiness and plead with us to repent knowing full well that wickedness never was and never will be happiness 9 So Ezekiel and every prophet before and since speaking the word of God out of a full heart have warned all who will to turn away from Satan the enemy of their souls and choose liberty and eternal life through the great Mediator of all men 10While the duty to warn is felt especially keenly by prophets it is a duty shared by others as well In fact it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor 11 We who have received a knowledge of the great plan of happiness and its implementing commandments should feel a desire to share that knowledge since it makes all the difference here and in eternity And if we ask Who is my neighbor that I should warn surely the answer will be found in a parable that begins A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves 12 and so forth Considering the parable of the good Samaritan in this context reminds us that the question Who is my neighbor was tied to the two great commandments Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself 13 The motivation for raising the warning voice is love love of God and love of fellowman To warn is to care The Lord instructs that it is to be done in mildness and in meekness 14 and by persuasion by long suffering by gentleness and by love unfeigned 15 It can be urgent as when we warn a child not to put his or her hand in a fire It must be clear and sometimes firm On occasion warning may take the form of reproof when moved upon by the Holy Ghost 16 but always it is rooted in love Witness for example the love that motivates the service and sacrifices of our missionaries Surely love would compel parents to warn their closest neighbors their own children This means teaching and testifying of gospel truths It means teaching children the doctrine of Christ faith repentance baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost 17 The Lord reminds parents I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth 18A crucial element of the parental duty to warn is to paint not only the demoralizing consequences of sin but also the joy of walking in obedience to the commandments Recall the words of Enos about what led him to seek God receive a remission of sins and become converted Behold I went to hunt beasts in the forests and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life and the joy of the saints sunk deep into my heart And my soul hungered and I kneeled down before my Maker and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication 19Because of His incomparable love and concern for others and their happiness Jesus was not hesitant to warn At the outset of His ministry Jesus began to preach and to say Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand 20 Because He knows that not just any path leads to heaven He commanded Enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat Because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it 21He devoted time to sinners saying I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance 22As for the scribes and Pharisees and Sadducees Jesus was uncompromising in condemning their hypocrisy His warnings and commandments were direct Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone 23 Surely no one would accuse the Savior of not loving these scribes and Pharisees after all He suffered and died to save them too But loving them He could not let them go on in sin without clearly correcting them One observer noted Jesus taught his followers to do as he did to welcome everyone but also to teach about sin since love demands warning people about what can hurt them 24Sometimes those who raise a warning voice are dismissed as judgmental Paradoxically however those who claim truth is relative and moral standards are a matter of personal preference are often the same ones who most harshly criticize people who don t accept the current norm of correct thinking One writer referred to this as the shame culture In a guilt culture you know you are good or bad by what your conscience feels In a shame culture you know you are good or bad by what your community says about you by whether it honors or excludes you In the shame culture moral life is not built on the continuum of right and wrong it s built on the continuum of inclusion and exclusion Everybody is perpetually insecure in a moral system based on inclusion and exclusion There are no permanent standards just the shifting judgment of the crowd It is a culture of oversensitivity overreaction and frequent moral panics during which everybody feels compelled to go along The guilt culture could be harsh but at least you could hate the sin and still love the sinner The modern shame culture allegedly values inclusion and tolerance but it can be strangely unmerciful to those who disagree and to those who don t fit in 25Contrasted to this is the rock of our Redeemer 26 a stable and permanent foundation of justice and virtue How much better it is to have the unchanging law of God by which we may act to choose our destiny rather than being hostage to the unpredictable rules and wrath of the social media mob How much better it is to know the truth than to be tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine 27 How much better to repent and rise to the gospel standard than to pretend there is no right or wrong and languish in sin and regret The Lord has declared The voice of warning shall be unto all people by the mouths of my disciples whom I have chosen in these last days 28 As watchmen and disciples we cannot be neutral about this more excellent way 29 As Ezekiel we cannot see the sword coming upon the land and blow not the trumpet 30 This is not to say that we should bang on our neighbor s door or stand in the public square shouting Repent Truly when you think about it we have in the restored gospel what people deep down really want So the warning voice is generally not only civil but in the Psalmist s phrase it is a joyful noise 31Deseret News opinion editor Hal Boyd cited one example of the disservice inherent in staying silent He noted that while the idea of marriage is still a matter of intellectual debate among elites in American society marriage itself is not a matter of debate for them in practice Elites get and stay married and make sure their kids enjoy the benefits of stable marriage The problem however is that they tend not to preach what they practice They don t want to impose on those who really could use their moral leadership but it is perhaps time for those with education and strong families to stop feigning neutrality and start preaching what they practice pertaining to marriage and parenting and help their fellow Americans embrace it 32We trust that especially you of the rising generation youth and young adults on whom the Lord must rely for the success of His work in future years will sustain the teachings of the gospel and the standards of the Church in public as well as in private Do not abandon those who would welcome truth to floundering and failing in ignorance Do not succumb to false notions of tolerance or to fear fear of inconvenience disapproval or even suffering Remember the Savior s promise Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you 33Ultimately we are all accountable to God for our choices and the lives we live The Savior declared My Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross that I might draw all men unto me that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father to stand before me to be judged of their works whether they be good or whether they be evil 34Recognizing this the Lord s supremacy I plead in the words of Alma And now my brethren and sisters I wish from the inmost part of my heart yea with great anxiety even unto pain that ye would cast off your sins and not procrastinate the day of your repentance But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord and call on his holy name and watch and pray continually that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear and thus be led by the Holy Spirit Having faith on the Lord having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life having the love of God always in your hearts that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest 35May we each be able to say to the Lord with David I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me O Lord 36 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Bible tells us that God is love 1 He is the perfect embodiment of love and we rely heavily on the constancy and universal reach of that love As President Thomas S Monson has expressed God s love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve love It is simply always there 2There are many ways to describe and speak of divine love One of the terms we hear often today is that God s love is unconditional While in one sense that is true the descriptor unconditional appears nowhere in scripture Rather His love is described in scripture as great and wonderful love 3 perfect love 4 redeeming love 5 and everlasting love 6 These are better terms because the word unconditional can convey mistaken impressions about divine love such as God tolerates and excuses anything we do because His love is unconditional or God makes no demands upon us because His love is unconditional or all are saved in the heavenly kingdom of God because His love is unconditional God s love is infinite and it will endure forever but what it means for each of us depends on how we respond to His love Jesus said As the Father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as I have kept my Father s commandments and abide in his love 7To continue in or abide in the Savior s love means to receive His grace and be perfected by it 8 To receive His grace we must have faith in Jesus Christ and keep His commandments including repenting of our sins being baptized for the remission of sins receiving the Holy Ghost and continuing in the path of obedience 9God will always love us but He cannot save us in our sins 10 Remember the words of Amulek to Zeezrom that the Savior would not save His people in their sins but from their sins 11 the reason being that with sin we are unclean and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven 12 or dwell in God s presence And Christ hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem His people from their sins because of repentance therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer unto the salvation of their souls 13From the Book of Mormon we learn that the intent of Christ s suffering the ultimate manifestation of His love was to bring about the bowels of mercy which overpowereth justice and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice and encircles them in the arms of safety while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption 14Repentance then is His gift to us purchased at a very dear price Some will argue that God blesses everyone without distinction citing for example Jesus s statement in the Sermon on the Mount God maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust 15 Indeed God does rain down upon all His children all the blessings He can all the blessings that love and law and justice and mercy will permit And He commands us to be likewise generous I say unto you Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven 16Nevertheless God s greater blessings are conditioned on obedience President Russell M Nelson explained The resplendent bouquet of God s love including eternal life includes blessings for which we must qualify not entitlements to be expected unworthily Sinners cannot bend His will to theirs and require Him to bless them in sin see Alma 11 37 If they desire to enjoy every bloom in His beautiful bouquet they must repent 17Beyond rendering the penitent person guiltless and spotless with the promise of being lifted up at the last day 18 there is a second vital aspect of abiding in the love of God Abiding in His love will enable us to realize our full potential to become even as He is 19 As President Dieter F Uchtdorf stated The grace of God does not merely restore us to our previous innocent state His aim is much higher He wants His sons and daughters to become like Him 20To abide in God s love in this sense means to submit fully to His will It means to accept His correction when needed for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth 21 It means to love and serve one another as Jesus has loved and served us 22 It means to learn to abide the law of a celestial kingdom so that we can abide a celestial glory 23 For Him to be able to make of us what we can become our Heavenly Father pleads with us to yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and put off the natural man and become a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord and become as a child submissive meek humble patient full of love willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him even as a child doth submit to his father 24Elder Dallin H Oaks observed The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts what we have done It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts what we have become 25The story of Helen Keller is something of a parable suggesting how divine love can transform a willing soul Helen was born in the state of Alabama in the United States in 1880 When just 19 months old she suffered an undiagnosed illness that left her both deaf and blind She was extremely intelligent and became frustrated as she tried to understand and make sense of her surroundings When Helen felt the moving lips of family members and realized that they used their mouths to speak she flew into a rage because she was unable to join in the conversation 26 By the time Helen was six her need to communicate and her frustration grew so intense that her outbursts occurred daily sometimes hourly 27Helen s parents hired a teacher for their daughter a woman named Anne Sullivan Just as we have in Jesus Christ one who understands our infirmities 28 Anne Sullivan had struggled with her own serious hardships and understood Helen s infirmities At age five Anne had contracted a disease that caused painful scarring of the cornea and left her mostly blind When Anne was eight her mother died her father abandoned her and her younger brother Jimmie and they were sent to a poor house where conditions were so deplorable that Jimmie died after only three months Through her own dogged persistence Anne gained entry to the Perkins School for the Blind and vision impaired where she succeeded brilliantly A surgical operation gave her improved vision so that she was able to read print When Helen Keller s father contacted the Perkins School seeking someone to become a teacher for his daughter Anne Sullivan was selected 29It was not a pleasant experience at the beginning Helen hit pinched and kicked her teacher and knocked out one of her teeth Anne finally gained control by moving with Helen into a small cottage on the Kellers property Through patience and firm consistency she finally won the child s heart and trust 30 Similarly as we come to trust rather than resist our divine Teacher He can work with us to enlighten and lift us to a new reality 31To help Helen learn words Anne would spell the names of familiar objects with her finger on the palm of Helen s hand Helen enjoyed this finger play but she didn t understand until the famous moment when Anne spelled w a t e r while pumping water over Helen s hand Helen later wrote Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me I knew then that w a t e r meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand That living word awakened my soul gave it light hope joy set it free Everything had a name and each name gave birth to a new thought As we returned to the house every object I touched seemed to quiver with life 32As Helen Keller grew to adulthood she became known for her love of language her skill as a writer and her eloquence as a public speaker In a movie depicting the life of Helen Keller her parents are portrayed as satisfied with Anne Sullivan s work once she has domesticated their wild daughter to the extent that Helen will sit politely at dinner eat normally and fold her napkin at the end of the meal But Anne knew Helen was capable of much much more and that she had significant contributions to make 33 Even so we may be quite content with what we have done in our lives and that we simply are what we are while our Savior comprehends a glorious potential that we perceive only through a glass darkly 34 Each of us can experience the ecstasy of divine potential unfolding within us much like the joy Helen Keller felt when words came to life giving light to her soul and setting it free Each of us can love and serve God and be empowered to bless our fellowman As it is written Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 35Let us consider the cost of God s precious love Jesus revealed that to atone for our sins and redeem us from death both physical and spiritual His suffering caused Himself even God the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore and to suffer both body and spirit and would that He might not drink the bitter cup and shrink 36 His agony in Gethsemane and on the cross was greater than any mortal could bear 37 Nevertheless because of His love for His Father and for us He endured and as a consequence He can offer us both immortality and eternal life It is poignantly symbolic that blood came from every pore 38 as Jesus suffered in Gethsemane the place of the olive press To produce olive oil in the Savior s time olives were first crushed by rolling a large stone over them The resulting mash was placed in soft loosely woven baskets which were piled one upon another Their weight expressed the first and finest oil Then added stress was applied by placing a large beam or log on top of the stacked baskets producing more oil Finally to draw out the very last drops the beam was weighted with stones on one end to create the maximum crushing pressure 39 And yes the oil is bloodred as it first flows out I think of Matthew s account of the Savior as He entered Gethsemane that fateful night that He began to be sorrowful and very heavy And he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt 40Then as I imagine the distress grew even more severe He pleaded a second time for relief and finally perhaps at the peak of His suffering a third time He endured the agony until justice was satisfied to the very last drop 41 This He did to redeem you and me What a precious gift is divine love Filled with that love Jesus asks Will ye not now return unto me and repent of your sins and be converted that I may heal you 42 Tenderly He reassures Behold mine arm of mercy is extended towards you and whosoever will come will I receive and blessed are those who come unto me 43Will you not love Him who first loved you 44 Then keep His commandments 45 Will you not be a friend to Him who laid down His life for His friends 46 Then keep His commandments 47 Will you not abide in His love and receive all that He graciously offers you Then keep His commandments 48 I pray that we will feel and fully abide in His love in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I speak today of fathers Fathers are fundamental in the divine plan of happiness and I want to raise a voice of encouragement for those who are striving to fill well that calling To praise and encourage fatherhood and fathers is not to shame or discount anyone I simply focus today on the good that men can do in the highest of masculine roles husband and father David Blankenhorn the author of Fatherless America has observed Today American society is fundamentally divided and ambivalent about the fatherhood idea Some people do not even remember it Others are offended by it Others including more than a few family scholars neglect it or disdain it Many others are not especially opposed to it nor are they especially committed to it Many people wish we could act on it but believe that our society simply no longer can or will 1As a Church we believe in fathers We believe in the ideal of the man who puts his family first 2 We believe that by divine design fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families 3 We believe that in their complementary family duties fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners 4 We believe that far from being superfluous fathers are unique and irreplaceable Some see the good of fatherhood in social terms as something that obligates men to their offspring impelling them to be good citizens and to think about the needs of others supplementing maternal investment in children with paternal investment in children In short the key for men is to be fathers The key for children is to have fathers The key for society is to create fathers 5 While these considerations are certainly true and important we know that fatherhood is much more than a social construct or the product of evolution The role of father is of divine origin beginning with a Father in Heaven and in this mortal sphere with Father Adam The perfect divine expression of fatherhood is our Heavenly Father His character and attributes include abundant goodness and perfect love His work and glory are the development happiness and eternal life of His children 6 Fathers in this fallen world can claim nothing comparable to the Majesty on High but at their best they are striving to emulate Him and they indeed labor in His work They are honored with a remarkable and sobering trust For men fatherhood exposes us to our own weaknesses and our need to improve Fatherhood requires sacrifice but it is a source of incomparable satisfaction even joy Again the ultimate model is our Heavenly Father who so loved us His spirit children that He gave us His Only Begotten Son for our salvation and exaltation 7 Jesus said Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends 8 Fathers manifest that love as they lay down their lives day by day laboring in the service and support of their families Perhaps the most essential of a father s work is to turn the hearts of his children to their Heavenly Father If by his example as well as his words a father can demonstrate what fidelity to God looks like in day to day living that father will have given his children the key to peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come 9 A father who reads scripture to and with his children acquaints them with the voice of the Lord 10We find in the scriptures a repeated emphasis on the parental obligation to teach one s children And again inasmuch as parents have children in Zion or in any of her stakes which are organized that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in Christ the Son of the living God and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands when eight years old the sin be upon the heads of the parents And they shall also teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord 11In 1833 the Lord reprimanded members of the First Presidency for inadequate attention to the duty of teaching their children To one He said specifically You have not taught your children light and truth according to the commandments and that wicked one hath power as yet over you and this is the cause of your affliction 12Fathers are to teach God s law and works anew to each generation As the Psalmist declared For he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children That the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should then arise and declare them to their children That they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his commandments 13Certainly teaching the gospel is a shared duty between fathers and mothers but the Lord is clear that He expects fathers to lead out in making it a high priority And let s remember that informal conversations working and playing together and listening are important elements of teaching The Lord expects fathers to help shape their children and children want and need a model I myself was blessed with an exemplary father I recall that when I was a boy of about 12 my father became a candidate for the city council in our rather small community He did not mount an extensive election campaign all I remember was that Dad had my brothers and me distribute copies of a flyer door to door urging people to vote for Paul Christofferson There were a number of adults that I handed a flyer to who remarked that Paul was a good and honest man and that they would have no problem voting for him My young boy heart swelled with pride in my father It gave me confidence and a desire to follow in his footsteps He was not perfect no one is but he was upright and good and an aspirational example for a son Discipline and correction are part of teaching As Paul said For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth 14 But in discipline a father must exercise particular care lest there be anything even approaching abuse which is never justified When a father provides correction his motivation must be love and his guide the Holy Spirit Reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the Holy Ghost and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death 15Discipline in the divine pattern is not so much about punishing as it is about helping a loved one along the path of self mastery The Lord has said that all children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age 16 Breadwinning is a consecrated activity Providing for one s family although it generally requires time away from the family is not inconsistent with fatherhood it is the essence of being a good father Work and family are overlapping domains 17 This of course does not justify a man who neglects his family for his career or at the other extreme one who will not exert himself and is content to shift his responsibility to others In the words of King Benjamin Ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry or naked neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God and fight and quarrel one with another But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness ye will teach them to love one another and to serve one another 18We recognize the agony of men who are unable to find ways and means adequately to sustain their families There is no shame for those who at a given moment despite their best efforts cannot fulfill all the duties and functions of fathers Disability death or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation Extended families should lend support when needed 19Loving the mother of his children and showing that love are two of the best things a father can do for his children This reaffirms and strengthens the marriage that is the foundation of their family life and security Some men are single fathers foster fathers or stepfathers Many of them strive mightily and do their very best in an often difficult role We honor those who do all that can be done in love patience and self sacrifice to meet individual and family needs It should be noted that God Himself entrusted His Only Begotten Son to a foster father Surely some of the credit goes to Joseph for the fact that as Jesus grew He increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man 20Regrettably due to death abandonment or divorce some children don t have fathers living with them Some may have fathers who are physically present but emotionally absent or in other ways inattentive or nonsupportive We call on all fathers to do better and to be better We call on media and entertainment outlets to portray devoted and capable fathers who truly love their wives and intelligently guide their children instead of the bumblers and buffoons or the guys who cause problems as fathers are all too frequently depicted To children whose family situation is troubled we say you yourself are no less for that Challenges are at times an indication of the Lord s trust in you He can help you directly and through others to deal with what you face You can become the generation perhaps the first in your family where the divine patterns that God has ordained for families truly take shape and bless all the generations after you To young men recognizing the role you will have as provider and protector we say prepare now by being diligent in school and planning for postsecondary training Education whether in a university technical school apprenticeship or similar program is key to developing the skills and capabilities you will need Take advantage of opportunities to associate with people of all ages including children and learn how to establish healthy and rewarding relationships That typically means talking face to face with people and sometimes doing things together not just perfecting your texting skills Live your life so that as a man you will bring purity to your marriage and to your children To all the rising generation we say wherever you rank your own father on the scale of good better best and I predict that ranking will go higher as you grow older and wiser make up your mind to honor him and your mother by your own life Remember the yearning hope of a father as expressed by John I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth 21 Your righteousness is the greatest honor any father can receive To my brethren the fathers in this Church I say I know you wish you were a more perfect father I know I wish I were Even so despite our limitations let us press on Let us lay aside the exaggerated notions of individualism and autonomy in today s culture and think first of the happiness and well being of others Surely despite our inadequacies our Heavenly Father will magnify us and cause our simple efforts to bear fruit I am encouraged by a story that appeared in the New Era some years ago The author recounted the following When I was young our little family lived in a one bedroom apartment on the second floor I slept on the couch in the living room My dad a steelworker left home very early for work each day Every morning he would tuck the covers around me and stop for a minute I would be half dreaming when I could sense my dad standing beside the couch looking at me As I slowly awoke I became embarrassed to have him there I tried to pretend I was still asleep I became aware that as he stood beside my bed he was praying with all his attention energy and focus for me Each morning my dad prayed for me He prayed that I would have a good day that I would be safe that I would learn and prepare for the future And since he could not be with me until evening he prayed for the teachers and my friends that I would be with that day At first I didn t really understand what my dad was doing those mornings when he prayed for me But as I got older I came to sense his love and interest in me and everything I was doing It is one of my favorite memories It wasn t until years later after I was married had children of my own and would go into their rooms while they were asleep and pray for them that I understood completely how my father felt about me 22Alma testified to his son Behold I say unto you that it is Christ that surely shall come yea he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people And now my son this was the ministry unto which ye were called to declare these glad tidings unto this people to prepare their minds or rather that they may prepare the minds of their children to hear the word at the time of his coming 23That is the ministry of fathers today God bless and make them equal to it in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Throughout my life general conferences of the Church have been exhilarating spiritual events and the Church itself has been a place to come to know the Lord I realize that there are those who consider themselves religious or spiritual and yet reject participation in a church or even the need for such an institution Religious practice is for them purely personal Yet the Church is the creation of Him in whom our spirituality is centered Jesus Christ It is worth pausing to consider why He chooses to use a church His Church The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints to carry out His and His Father s work to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 1Beginning with Adam the gospel of Jesus Christ was preached and the essential ordinances of salvation such as baptism were administered through a family based priesthood order 2 As societies grew more complex than simply extended families God also called other prophets messengers and teachers In Moses s time we read of a more formal structure including elders priests and judges In Book of Mormon history Alma established a church with priests and teachers Then in the meridian of time Jesus organized His work in such a way that the gospel could be established simultaneously in multiple nations and among diverse peoples That organization the Church of Jesus Christ was founded on apostles and prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone 3 It included additional officers such as seventies elders bishops priests teachers and deacons Jesus similarly established the Church in the Western Hemisphere after His Resurrection Following the apostasy and disintegration of the Church He had organized while on the earth the Lord reestablished the Church of Jesus Christ once again through the Prophet Joseph Smith The ancient purpose remains that is to preach the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ and administer the ordinances of salvation in other words to bring people to Christ 4 And now through the instrumentality of this restored Church the promise of redemption is placed within reach even of the spirits of the dead who in their mortal lifetime knew little or nothing of the Savior s grace How does His Church accomplish the Lord s purposes It is important to recognize that God s ultimate purpose is our progress His desire is that we continue from grace to grace until we receive a fulness 5 of all He can give That requires more than simply being nice or feeling spiritual It requires faith in Jesus Christ repentance baptism of water and of the Spirit and enduring in faith to the end 6 One cannot fully achieve this in isolation so a major reason the Lord has a church is to create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life 7 And Christ gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers For the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ 8Jesus Christ is the author and the finisher of our faith 9 Uniting ourselves to the body of Christ the Church is an important part of taking His name upon us 10 We are told that the ancient Church did meet together oft to fast and to pray and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls 11 and to hear the word of the Lord 12 So it is in the Church today Joined in faith we teach and edify one another and strive to approach the full measure of discipleship the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ We strive to help one another come to the knowledge of the Son of God 13 until that day when they shall teach no more every man his neighbour saying Know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord 14In the Church we not only learn divine doctrine we also experience its application As the body of Christ the members of the Church minister to one another in the reality of day to day life All of us are imperfect we may offend and be offended We often test one another with our personal idiosyncrasies In the body of Christ we have to go beyond concepts and exalted words and have a real hands on experience as we learn to live together in love 15This religion is not concerned only with self rather we are all called to serve We are the eyes hands head feet and other members of the body of Christ and even those members which seem to be more feeble are necessary 16 We need these callings and we need to serve One of the men in my ward grew up not only without parental support but with parental opposition to his activity in the Church He made this observation in a sacrament meeting My father cannot understand why anyone would go to church when they could go skiing but I really like going to church In the Church we are all on the same journey and I am inspired in that journey by strong youth pure children and what I see and learn from other adults I am strengthened by the association and excited with the joy of living the gospel The wards and branches of the Church offer a weekly gathering of respite and renewal a time and place to leave the world behind the Sabbath It is a day to delight thyself in the Lord 17 to experience the spiritual healing that comes with the sacrament and to receive the renewed promise of His Spirit to be with us 18One of the greatest blessings of being part of the body of Christ though it may not seem like a blessing in the moment is being reproved of sin and error We are prone to excuse and rationalize our faults and sometimes we simply do not know where we should improve or how to do it Without those who can reprove us betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the Holy Ghost 19 we might lack the courage to change and more perfectly follow the Master Repentance is individual but fellowship on that sometimes painful path is in the Church 20In this discussion of the Church as the body of Christ we must always bear in mind two things One we do not strive for conversion to the Church but to Christ and His gospel a conversion that is facilitated by the Church 21 The Book of Mormon expresses it best when it says that the people were converted unto the Lord and were united unto the church of Christ 22 Two we must remember that in the beginning the Church was the family and even today as separate institutions the family and the Church serve and strengthen one another Neither supplants the other and certainly the Church even at its best cannot substitute for parents The point of gospel teaching and priesthood ordinances administered by the Church is that families may qualify for eternal life There is a second major reason the Savior works through a church His Church and that is to achieve needful things that cannot be accomplished by individuals or smaller groups One clear example is dealing with poverty It is true that as individuals and families we look after the physical needs of others imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants 23 But together in the Church the ability to care for the poor and needy is multiplied to meet the broader need and hoped for self reliance is made a reality for very many 24 Further the Church its Relief Societies and its priesthood quorums have the capacity to provide relief to many people in many places affected by natural disasters war and persecution Without the capabilities of His Church in place the Savior s commission to take the gospel to all the world could not be realized 25 There would not be the apostolic keys the structure the financial means and the devotion and sacrifice of thousands upon thousands of missionaries needed to carry out the work Remember this Gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come 26The Church can build and operate temples houses of the Lord where vital ordinances and covenants may be administered Joseph Smith stated that God s objective in gathering His people in any age is to build unto the Lord a house whereby He can reveal unto His people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom and teach the people the way of salvation for there are certain ordinances and principles that when they are taught and practiced must be done in a place or house built for that purpose 27If one believes that all roads lead to heaven or that there are no particular requirements for salvation he or she will see no need for proclaiming the gospel or for ordinances and covenants in redeeming either the living or the dead But we speak not just of immortality but also of eternal life and for that the gospel path and gospel covenants are essential And the Savior needs a church to make them available to all of God s children both the living and the dead The final reason I will mention for the Lord to have established His Church is the most unique the Church is after all the kingdom of God on the earth As The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints was being established in the 1830s the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith Lift up your hearts and rejoice for unto you the kingdom or in other words the keys of the church have been given 28 In the authority of these keys the Church s priesthood officers preserve the purity of the Savior s doctrine and the integrity of His saving ordinances 29 They help prepare those who wish to receive them judge the qualification and worthiness of those who apply and then perform them With the keys of the kingdom the Lord s servants can identify both truth and falsehood and once again authoritatively state Thus saith the Lord Regrettably some resent the Church because they want to define their own truth but in reality it is a surpassing blessing to receive a knowledge of things as they truly are and as they were and as they are to come 30 insofar as the Lord wills to reveal it The Church safeguards and publishes God s revelations the canon of scripture When Daniel interpreted the dream of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar making known to the king what shall be in the latter days 31 he declared that the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all other kingdoms and it shall stand for ever 32 The Church is that prophesied latter day kingdom not created by man but set up by the God of heaven and rolling forth as a stone cut out of the mountain without hands to fill the earth 33Its destiny is to establish Zion in preparation for the return and millennial rule of Jesus Christ Before that day it will not be a kingdom in any political sense as the Savior said My kingdom is not of this world 34 Rather it is the repository of His authority in the earth the administrator of His holy covenants the custodian of His temples the protector and proclaimer of His truth the gathering place for scattered Israel and a defense and a refuge from the storm and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth 35I end with the Prophet s plea and prayer Call upon the Lord that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth that the inhabitants thereof may receive it and be prepared for the days to come in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven clothed in the brightness of his glory to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth Wherefore may the kingdom of God go forth that the kingdom of heaven may come that thou O God mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth that thine enemies may be subdued for thine is the honor power and glory forever and ever 36In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Above the Great West Door of the renowned Westminster Abbey in London England stand the statues of 10 Christian martyrs of the 20th century Included among them is Dietrich Bonhoeffer a brilliant German theologian born in 1906 1 Bonhoeffer became a vocal critic of the Nazi dictatorship and its treatment of Jews and others He was imprisoned for his active opposition and finally executed in a concentration camp Bonhoeffer was a prolific writer and some of his best known pieces are letters that sympathetic guards helped him smuggle out of prison later published as Letters and Papers from Prison One of those letters was to his niece before her wedding It included these significant insights Marriage is more than your love for each other In your love you see only your two selves in the world but in marriage you are a link in the chain of the generations which God causes to come and to pass away to his glory and calls into his kingdom In your love you see only the heaven of your own happiness but in marriage you are placed at a post of responsibility towards the world and mankind Your love is your own private possession but marriage is more than something personal it is a status an office Just as it is the crown and not merely the will to rule that makes the king so it is marriage and not merely your love for each other that joins you together in the sight of God and man So love comes from you but marriage from above from God 2In what way does marriage between a man and a woman transcend their love for one another and their own happiness to become a post of responsibility towards the world and mankind In what sense does it come from above from God To understand we have to go back to the beginning Prophets have revealed that we first existed as intelligences and that we were given form or spirit bodies by God thus becoming His spirit children sons and daughters of heavenly parents 3 There came a time in this premortal existence of spirits when in furtherance of His desire that we could have a privilege to advance like himself 4 our Heavenly Father prepared an enabling plan In the scriptures it is given various names including the plan of salvation 5 the great plan of happiness 6 and the plan of redemption 7 The two principal purposes of the plan were explained to Abraham in these words And there stood one among them that was like unto God and he said unto those who were with him We will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these spirits may dwell And we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever 8Thanks to our Heavenly Father we had already become spirit beings Now He was offering us a path to complete or perfect that being The addition of the physical element is essential to the fulness of being and glory that God Himself enjoys If while with God in the premortal spirit world we would agree to participate in His plan or in other words keep our first estate we would be added upon with a physical body as we came to dwell on the earth that He created for us If then in the course of our mortal experience we chose to do all things whatsoever the Lord our God should command us we would have kept our second estate This means that by our choices we would demonstrate to God and to ourselves our commitment and capacity to live His celestial law while outside His presence and in a physical body with all its powers appetites and passions Could we bridle the flesh so that it became the instrument rather than the master of the spirit Could we be trusted both in time and eternity with godly powers including power to create life Would we individually overcome evil Those who did would have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever a very significant aspect of that glory being a resurrected immortal and glorified physical body 9 No wonder we shouted for joy at these magnificent possibilities and promises 10At least four things are needed for the success of this divine plan First was the Creation of the earth as our dwelling place Whatever the details of the creation process we know that it was not accidental but that it was directed by God the Father and implemented by Jesus Christ all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made 11Second is the condition of mortality Adam and Eve acted for all who had chosen to participate in the Father s great plan of happiness 12 Their Fall created the conditions needed for our physical birth and for mortal experience and learning outside the presence of God With the Fall came an awareness of good and evil and the God given power to choose 13 Finally the Fall brought about physical death needed to make our time in mortality temporary so that we would not live forever in our sins 14Third is redemption from the Fall We see the role of death in our Heavenly Father s plan but that plan would become void without some way to overcome death in the end both physical and spiritual Thus a Redeemer the Only Begotten Son of God Jesus Christ suffered and died to atone for Adam and Eve s transgression thereby providing resurrection and immortality for all And since none of us will have been perfectly and consistently obedient to the gospel law His Atonement also redeems us from our own sins on condition of repentance With the Savior s atoning grace providing forgiveness of sins and sanctification of the soul we can spiritually be born again and reconciled to God Our spiritual death our separation from God will end 15Fourth and finally is the setting for our physical birth and subsequent spiritual rebirth into the kingdom of God For His work to succeed to exalt us with himself 16 God ordained that men and women should marry and give birth to children thereby creating in partnership with God the physical bodies that are key to the test of mortality and essential to eternal glory with Him He also ordained that parents should establish families and rear their children in light and truth 17 leading them to a hope in Christ The Father commands us Teach these things freely unto your children saying That inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water and blood and the spirit which I have made and so became of dust a living soul even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven of water and of the Holy Spirit and be cleansed by blood even the blood of mine Only Begotten that ye might be sanctified from all sin and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world and eternal life in the world to come even immortal glory 18Knowing why we left the presence of our Heavenly Father and what it takes to return and be exalted with Him it becomes very clear that nothing relative to our time on earth can be more important than physical birth and spiritual rebirth the two prerequisites of eternal life This is to use the words of Dietrich Bonhoeffer the office of marriage the post of responsibility towards mankind that this divine institution from above from God occupies It is the link in the chain of the generations both here and hereafter the order of heaven A family built on the marriage of a man and woman supplies the best setting for God s plan to thrive the setting for the birth of children who come in purity and innocence from God and the environment for the learning and preparation they will need for a successful mortal life and eternal life in the world to come A critical mass of families built on such marriages is vital for societies to survive and flourish That is why communities and nations generally have encouraged and protected marriage and the family as privileged institutions It has never been just about the love and happiness of adults The social science case for marriage and for families headed by a married man and woman is compelling 19 And so we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets 20 But our claims for the role of marriage and family rest not on social science but on the truth that they are God s creation It is He who in the beginning created Adam and Eve in His image male and female and joined them as husband and wife to become one flesh and to multiply and replenish the earth 21 Each individual carries the divine image but it is in the matrimonial union of male and female as one that we attain perhaps the most complete meaning of our having been made in the image of God male and female Neither we nor any other mortal can alter this divine order of matrimony It is not a human invention Such marriage is indeed from above from God and is as much a part of the plan of happiness as the Fall and the Atonement In the premortal world Lucifer rebelled against God and His plan and his opposition only grows in intensity He fights to discourage marriage and the formation of families and where marriages and families are formed he does what he can to disrupt them He attacks everything that is sacred about human sexuality tearing it from the context of marriage with a seemingly infinite array of immoral thoughts and acts He seeks to convince men and women that marriage and family priorities can be ignored or abandoned or at least made subservient to careers other achievements and the quest for self fulfillment and individual autonomy Certainly the adversary is pleased when parents neglect to teach and train their children to have faith in Christ and be spiritually born again Brothers and sisters many things are good many are important but only a few are essential To declare the fundamental truths relative to marriage and family is not to overlook or diminish the sacrifices and successes of those for whom the ideal is not a present reality Some of you are denied the blessing of marriage for reasons including a lack of viable prospects same sex attraction physical or mental impairments or simply a fear of failure that for the moment at least overshadows faith Or you may have married but that marriage ended and you are left to manage alone what two together can barely sustain Some of you who are married cannot bear children despite overwhelming desires and pleading prayers Even so everyone has gifts everyone has talents everyone can contribute to the unfolding of the divine plan in each generation Much that is good much that is essential even sometimes all that is necessary for now can be achieved in less than ideal circumstances So many of you are doing your very best And when you who bear the heaviest burdens of mortality stand up in defense of God s plan to exalt His children we are all ready to march With confidence we testify that the Atonement of Jesus Christ has anticipated and in the end will compensate all deprivation and loss for those who turn to Him No one is predestined to receive less than all that the Father has for His children One young mother recently confided to me her anxiety about being inadequate in this highest of callings I felt that the issues that concerned her were small and she needn t worry she was doing fine But I knew she only wanted to please God and to honor His trust I offered words of reassurance and in my heart I pleaded that God her Heavenly Father would buoy her up with His love and the witness of His approval as she is about His work That is my prayer for all of us today May we each find approval in His sight May marriages flourish and families prosper and whether our lot is a fulness of these blessings in mortality or not may the Lord s grace bring happiness now and faith in sure promises to come In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
William Shakespeare s play The Life of King Henry V includes a nighttime scene in the camp of English soldiers at Agincourt just before their battle with the French army In the dim light and partially disguised King Henry wanders unrecognized among his soldiers He talks with them trying to gauge the morale of his badly outnumbered troops and because they do not realize who he is they are candid in their comments In one exchange they philosophize about who bears responsibility for what happens to men in battle the king or each individual soldier At one point King Henry declares Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king s company his cause being just Michael Williams retorts That s more than we know His companion agrees Ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the king s subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us Williams adds If the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make Not surprisingly King Henry disagrees Every subject s duty is the king s but every subject s soul is his own 1Shakespeare does not attempt to resolve this debate in the play and in one form or another it is a debate that continues down to our own time who bears responsibility for what happens in our lives When things turn bad there is a tendency to blame others or even God Sometimes a sense of entitlement arises and individuals or groups try to shift responsibility for their welfare to other people or to governments In spiritual matters some suppose that men and women need not strive for personal righteousness because God loves and saves us just as we are But God intends that His children should act according to the moral agency He has given them that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment 2 It is His plan and His will that we have the principal decision making role in our own life s drama God will not live our lives for us nor control us as if we were His puppets as Lucifer once proposed to do Nor will His prophets accept the role of puppet master in God s place Brigham Young stated I do not wish any Latter Day Saint in this world nor in heaven to be satisfied with anything I do unless the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ the spirit of revelation makes them satisfied I wish them to know for themselves and understand for themselves 3So God does not save us just as we are first because just as we are we are unclean and no unclean thing can dwell in his presence for in the language of Adam Man of Holiness is his name and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man of Holiness 4 And second God will not act to make us something we do not choose by our actions to become Truly He loves us and because He loves us He neither compels nor abandons us Rather He helps and guides us Indeed the real manifestation of God s love is His commandments We should and we do rejoice in the God ordained plan that permits us to make choices to act for ourselves and experience the consequences or as the scriptures express it to taste the bitter that we may know to prize the good 5 We are forever grateful that the Savior s Atonement overcame original sin so that we can be born into this world yet not be punished for Adam s transgression 6 Having been thus redeemed from the Fall we begin life innocent before God and become free forever knowing good from evil to act for ourselves and not to be acted upon 7 We can choose to become the kind of person that we will and with God s help that can be even as He is 8The gospel of Jesus Christ opens the path to what we may become Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and His grace our failures to live the celestial law perfectly and consistently in mortality can be erased and we are enabled to develop a Christlike character Justice demands however that none of this happen without our willing agreement and participation It has ever been so Our very presence on earth as physical beings is the consequence of a choice each of us made to participate in our Father s plan 9 Thus salvation is certainly not the result of divine whim but neither does it happen by divine will alone 10Justice is an essential attribute of God We can have faith in God because He is perfectly trustworthy The scriptures teach us that God doth not walk in crooked paths neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left neither doth he vary from that which he hath said therefore his paths are straight and his course is one eternal round 11 and that God is no respecter of persons 12 We rely on the divine quality of justice for faith confidence and hope But as a consequence of being perfectly just there are some things God cannot do He cannot be arbitrary in saving some and banishing others He cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance 13 He cannot allow mercy to rob justice 14It is compelling evidence of His justice that God has forged the companion principle of mercy It is because He is just that He devised the means for mercy to play its indispensable role in our eternal destiny So now justice exerciseth all his demands and also mercy claimeth all which is her own 15We know that it is the sufferings and death of him who did no sin in whom the Father wast well pleased the blood of His Son which was shed 16 that satisfies the demands of justice extends mercy and redeems us 17 Even so according to justice the plan of redemption could not be brought about only on conditions of repentance 18 It is the requirement of and the opportunity for repentance that permits mercy to perform its labor without trampling justice Christ died not to save indiscriminately but to offer repentance We rely wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save 19 in the process of repentance but acting to repent is a self willed change So by making repentance a condition for receiving the gift of grace God enables us to retain responsibility for ourselves Repentance respects and sustains our moral agency And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice and encircles them in the arms of safety while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption 20Misunderstanding God s justice and mercy is one thing denying God s existence or supremacy is another but either will result in our achieving less sometimes far less than our full divine potential A God who makes no demands is the functional equivalent of a God who does not exist A world without God the living God who establishes moral laws to govern and perfect His children is also a world without ultimate truth or justice It is a world where moral relativism reigns supreme Relativism means each person is his or her own highest authority Of course it is not just those who deny God that subscribe to this philosophy Some who believe in God still believe that they themselves individually decide what is right and wrong One young adult expressed it this way I don t think I could say that Hinduism is wrong or Catholicism is wrong or being Episcopalian is wrong I think it just depends on what you believe I don t think that there s a right and wrong 21 Another asked about the basis for his religious beliefs replied Myself it really comes down to that I mean how could there be authority to what you believe 22To those who believe anything or everything could be true the declaration of objective fixed and universal truth feels like coercion I shouldn t be forced to believe something is true that I don t like But that does not change reality Resenting the law of gravity won t keep a person from falling if he steps off a cliff The same is true for eternal law and justice Freedom comes not from resisting it but from applying it That is fundamental to God s own power If it were not for the reality of fixed and immutable truths the gift of agency would be meaningless since we would never be able to foresee and intend the consequences of our actions As Lehi expressed it If ye shall say there is no law ye shall also say there is no sin If ye shall say there is no sin ye shall also say there is no righteousness And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery And if these things are not there is no God And if there is no God we are not neither the earth for there could have been no creation of things neither to act nor to be acted upon wherefore all things must have vanished away 23In matters both temporal and spiritual the opportunity to assume personal responsibility is a God given gift without which we cannot realize our full potential as daughters and sons of God Personal accountability becomes both a right and a duty that we must constantly defend it has been under assault since before the Creation We must defend accountability against persons and programs that would sometimes with the best of intentions make us dependent And we must defend it against our own inclinations to avoid the work that is required to cultivate talents abilities and Christlike character The story is told of a man who simply would not work He wanted to be taken care of in every need To his way of thinking the Church or the government or both owed him a living because he had paid his taxes and his tithing He had nothing to eat but refused to work to care for himself Out of desperation and disgust those who had tried to help him decided that since he would not lift a finger to sustain himself they might as well just take him to the cemetery and let him pass on On the way to the cemetery one man said We can t do this I have some corn I will give him So they explained this to the man and he asked Have the husks been removed They responded No Well then he said drive on It is God s will that we be free men and women enabled to rise to our full potential both temporally and spiritually that we be free from the humiliating limitations of poverty and the bondage of sin that we enjoy self respect and independence that we be prepared in all things to join Him in His celestial kingdom I am under no illusion that this can be achieved by our own efforts alone without His very substantial and constant help We know that it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do 24 And we do not need to achieve some minimum level of capacity or goodness before God will help divine aid can be ours every hour of every day no matter where we are in the path of obedience But I know that beyond desiring His help we must exert ourselves repent and choose God for Him to be able to act in our lives consistent with justice and moral agency My plea is simply to take responsibility and go to work so that there is something for God to help us with I bear witness that God the Father lives that His Son Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and that the Holy Spirit is present with us Their desire to help us is undoubted and Their capacity to do so is infinite Let us awake and arise from the dust that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto us may be fulfilled 25 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
A crushing sense of defeat and despair enveloped His disciples as Jesus suffered and died on the cross and His body was placed lifeless in the tomb Despite what the Savior had repeatedly said of His death and subsequent rising again they had not understood The dark afternoon of His Crucifixion however was soon followed by the joyous morning of His Resurrection But that joy came only as the disciples became eyewitnesses of the Resurrection for even the declaration of angels that He had risen was at first incomprehensible it was something so totally unprecedented Mary Magdalene and a few other faithful women came early to the Savior s tomb that Sunday morning bringing spices and ointments to complete the anointing begun when the Lord s body was hastily laid in the sepulchre before the approaching Sabbath On this morning of mornings they were greeted by an open sepulchre the covering stone having been rolled away and two angels who declared Why seek ye the living among the dead He is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee Saying The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again 1 Come see the place where the Lord lay And go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead 2As bidden by the angels Mary Magdalene looked into the tomb but it seems that all that registered in her mind was that the body of the Lord was gone She hurried to report to the Apostles and finding Peter and John said to them They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him 3 Peter and John ran to the place and verified that indeed the tomb was empty seeing the linen clothes lying and the napkin that was about his head wrapped together in a place by itself 4 John apparently was the first to comprehend the magnificent message of resurrection He writes that he saw and believed whereas the others to that point knew not the scripture that Jesus must rise again from the dead 5Peter and John left but Mary remained behind still in mourning In the meantime the angels had returned and tenderly asked her Woman why weepest thou She saith unto them Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him 6 At that moment the resurrected Savior now standing behind her spoke Woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou She supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him Sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away 7Elder James E Talmage wrote It was Jesus to whom she spake her beloved Lord though she knew it not One word from His living lips changed her agonized grief into ecstatic joy Jesus saith unto her Mary The voice the tone the tender accent she had heard and loved in the earlier days lifted her from the despairing depths into which she had sunk She turned and saw the Lord In a transport of joy she reached out her arms to embrace Him uttering only the endearing and worshipful word Rabboni meaning My beloved Master 8And so this blessed woman became the first mortal to see and speak to the resurrected Christ Later that same day He appeared to Peter in or near Jerusalem 9 to two disciples on the road to Emmaus 10 and in the evening to 10 of the Apostles and others appearing suddenly in their midst saying Behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have 11 Then to further convince them while they yet believed not for joy and wondered 12 He ate broiled fish and honeycomb before them 13 Later He instructed them Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth 14Beyond these confirmed witnesses in Jerusalem we have the incomparable ministry of the risen Lord to ancient inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere In the land Bountiful He descended from heaven and invited the assembled throng some 2 500 to come forward one by one until they had all gone forth thrusting their hands into His side and feeling the prints of the nails in His hands and in His feet 15 And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves they did cry out with one accord saying Hosanna Blessed be the name of the Most High God And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus and did worship him 16Christ s Resurrection shows that His existence is independent and everlasting For as the Father hath life in himself so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself 17 Jesus said Therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again No man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again 18The Savior is not dependent on food or water or oxygen or any other substance or power or person for life Both as Jehovah and Messiah He is the great I Am the self existing God 19 He simply is and ever will be By His Atonement and Resurrection Jesus Christ has overcome all aspects of the Fall Physical death will be temporary and even spiritual death has an end in that all come back into the presence of God at least temporarily to be judged We can have ultimate trust and confidence in His power to overcome all else and grant us everlasting life For since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead For as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive 20In the words of Elder Neal A Maxwell Christ s victory over death ended the human predicament Now there are only personal predicaments and from these too we may be rescued by following the teachings of him who rescued us from general extinction 21Having satisfied the demands of justice Christ now steps into the place of justice or we might say He is justice just as He is love 22 Likewise besides being a perfect just God He is a perfect merciful God 23 Thus the Savior makes all things right No injustice in mortality is permanent even death for He restores life again No injury disability betrayal or abuse goes uncompensated in the end because of His ultimate justice and mercy By the same token we are all accountable to Him for our lives our choices and our actions even our thoughts Because He redeemed us from the Fall our lives are in reality His He declared Behold I have given unto you my gospel and this is the gospel which I have given unto you that I came into the world to do the will of my Father because my Father sent me And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross that I might draw all men unto me that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father to stand before me to be judged of their works 24Consider for a moment the significance of the Resurrection in resolving once and for all the true identity of Jesus of Nazareth and the great philosophical contests and questions of life If Jesus was in fact literally resurrected it necessarily follows that He is a divine being No mere mortal has the power in himself to come to life again after dying Because He was resurrected Jesus cannot have been only a carpenter a teacher a rabbi or a prophet Because He was resurrected Jesus had to have been a God even the Only Begotten Son of the Father Therefore what He taught is true God cannot lie 25Therefore He was the Creator of the earth as He said 26Therefore heaven and hell are real as He taught 27Therefore there is a world of spirits which He visited after His death 28Therefore He will come again as the angels said 29 and reign personally upon the earth 30Therefore there is a resurrection and a final judgment for all 31Given the reality of the Resurrection of Christ doubts about the omnipotence omniscience and benevolence of God the Father who gave His Only Begotten Son for the redemption of the world are groundless Doubts about the meaning and purpose of life are unfounded Jesus Christ is in fact the only name or way by which salvation can come to mankind The grace of Christ is real affording both forgiveness and cleansing to the repentant sinner Faith truly is more than imagination or psychological invention There is ultimate and universal truth and there are objective and unchanging moral standards as taught by Him Given the reality of the Resurrection of Christ repentance of any violation of His law and commandments is both possible and urgent The Savior s miracles were real as is His promise to His disciples that they might do the same and even greater works 32 His priesthood is necessarily a real power that administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom even the key of the knowledge of God Therefore in the ordinances thereof the power of godliness is manifest 33 Given the reality of the Resurrection of Christ death is not our end and though skin worms destroy our bodies yet in our flesh shall we see God 34President Thomas S Monson tells of a Robert Blatchford who 100 years ago in his book God and My Neighbor attacked with vigor accepted Christian beliefs such as God Christ prayer and immortality He boldly asserted I claim to have proved everything I set out to prove so fully and decisively that no Christian however great or able he may be can answer my arguments or shake my case He surrounded himself with a wall of skepticism Then a surprising thing happened His wall suddenly crumbled to dust Slowly he began to feel his way back to the faith he had scorned and ridiculed What had caused this profound change in his outlook His wife had died With a broken heart he went into the room where lay all that was mortal of her He looked again at the face he loved so well Coming out he said to a friend It is she and yet it is not she Everything is changed Something that was there before is taken away She is not the same What can be gone if it be not the soul 35Did the Lord in reality die and rise again Yes The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ that He died was buried and rose again the third day and ascended into heaven and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it 36As the prophesied birth of Jesus drew near there were those among the ancient Nephite and Lamanite peoples who believed though most doubted In due course the sign of His birth arrived a day and a night and a day without darkness and all knew 37 Even so today some believe in the literal Resurrection of Christ and many doubt or disbelieve But some know In due course all will see and all will know indeed every knee shall bow and every tongue confess before him 38Until then I believe the many witnesses of the Savior s Resurrection whose experiences and testimonies are found in the New Testament Peter and his companions of the Twelve and dear pure Mary of Magdala among others I believe the testimonies found in the Book of Mormon of Nephi the Apostle with the unnamed multitude in the land Bountiful among others And I believe the testimony of Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon who after many other testimonies proclaimed the great witness of this last dispensation that he lives For we saw him 39 Under the glance of His all seeing eye I stand myself as a witness that Jesus of Nazareth is the resurrected Redeemer and I testify of all that follows from the fact of His Resurrection May you receive the conviction and comfort of that same witness I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
From age immemorial societies have relied on the moral force of women While certainly not the only positive influence at work in society the moral foundation provided by women has proved uniquely beneficial to the common good Perhaps because it is pervasive this contribution of women is often underappreciated I wish to express gratitude for the influence of good women identify some of the philosophies and trends that threaten women s strength and standing and voice a plea to women to cultivate the innate moral power within them Women bring with them into the world a certain virtue a divine gift that makes them adept at instilling such qualities as faith courage empathy and refinement in relationships and in cultures When praising the unfeigned faith he found in Timothy Paul noted that this faith dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice 1Years ago while living in Mexico I observed firsthand what Paul meant I recall a particular young mother one of many among the women of the Church in Mexico whose faith in God graces their lives so naturally that they seem scarcely aware of it This lovely woman radiated a moral authority born of goodness that influenced all around her for good With her husband she sacrificed a number of pleasures and possessions for their higher priorities seemingly without a second thought Her ability to perform feats of lifting bending and balancing with her children was near superhuman The demands on her were many and her tasks often repetitive and mundane yet underneath it all was a beautiful serenity a sense of being about God s work As with the Savior she was ennobled by blessing others through service and sacrifice She was love personified I have been remarkably blessed by the moral influence of women in particular my mother and my wife Among other women that I look to in gratitude is Anna Daines Anna and her husband Henry and their four children were among the pioneers of the Church in New Jersey in the United States Beginning in the 1930s when Henry was a doctoral student at Rutgers University he and Anna worked tirelessly with school and civic organizations in Metuchen where they lived to overcome deeply rooted prejudice against Mormons and to make the community a better place for all parents to raise their children Anna for example volunteered at the Metuchen YMCA and made herself indispensable Within a year she was appointed president of the Mothers Auxiliary and then was asked to run for one of the three women s positions on the YMCA board of directors She won without opposition and so joined the very council that only a few years before had refused to let the Saints meet in their building 2My family moved into the New Brunswick Ward when I was a teenager Sister Daines took notice of me and often expressed her confidence in my abilities and potential which inspired me to reach high higher than I would have without her encouragement Once because of a thoughtful and timely warning from her I avoided a situation that would surely have led to regret Although she is no longer here Anna Daines s influence continues to be felt and reflected in the lives of her descendants and countless others myself included My grandmother Adena Warnick Swenson taught me to be conscientious in priesthood service She encouraged me to memorize the sacramental blessings on the bread and water explaining that in this way I could express them with greater understanding and feeling Observing how she sustained my grandfather a stake patriarch engendered in me a reverence for sacred things Grandma Swenson never learned how to drive a car but she knew how to help boys become priesthood men A woman s moral influence is nowhere more powerfully felt or more beneficially employed than in the home There is no better setting for rearing the rising generation than the traditional family where a father and a mother work in harmony to provide for teach and nurture their children Where this ideal does not exist people strive to duplicate its benefits as best they can in their particular circumstances In all events a mother can exert an influence unequaled by any other person in any other relationship By the power of her example and teaching her sons learn to respect womanhood and to incorporate discipline and high moral standards in their own lives Her daughters learn to cultivate their own virtue and to stand up for what is right again and again however unpopular A mother s love and high expectations lead her children to act responsibly without excuses to be serious about education and personal development and to make ongoing contributions to the well being of all around them Elder Neal A Maxwell once asked When the real history of mankind is fully disclosed will it feature the echoes of gunfire or the shaping sound of lullabies The great armistices made by military men or the peacemaking of women in homes and in neighborhoods Will what happened in cradles and kitchens prove to be more controlling than what happened in congresses 3Most sacred is a woman s role in the creation of life We know that our physical bodies have a divine origin4 and that we must experience both a physical birth and a spiritual rebirth to reach the highest realms in God s celestial kingdom 5 Thus women play an integral part sometimes at the risk of their own lives in God s work and glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 6 As grandmothers mothers and role models women have been the guardians of the wellspring of life teaching each generation the importance of sexual purity of chastity before marriage and fidelity within marriage In this way they have been a civilizing influence in society they have brought out the best in men they have perpetuated wholesome environments in which to raise secure and healthy children Sisters I don t want to overpraise you as we sometimes do in Mother s Day talks that make you cringe You don t have to be perfect 7 I don t claim that you are with one possible exception who is sitting nearby at the moment What I mean to say is that whether you are single or married whether you have borne children or not whether you are old young or in between your moral authority is vital and perhaps we have begun to take it and you for granted Certainly there are trends and forces at work that would weaken and even eliminate your influence to the great detriment of individuals families and society at large Let me mention three as a caution and a warning A pernicious philosophy that undermines women s moral influence is the devaluation of marriage and of motherhood and homemaking as a career Some view homemaking with outright contempt arguing it demeans women and that the relentless demands of raising children are a form of exploitation 8 They ridicule what they call the mommy track as a career This is not fair or right We do not diminish the value of what women or men achieve in any worthy endeavor or career we all benefit from those achievements but we still recognize there is not a higher good than motherhood and fatherhood in marriage There is no superior career and no amount of money authority or public acclaim can exceed the ultimate rewards of family Whatever else a woman may accomplish her moral influence is no more optimally employed than here Attitudes toward human sexuality threaten the moral authority of women on several fronts Abortion for personal or social convenience strikes at the heart of a woman s most sacred powers and destroys her moral authority The same is true of sexual immorality and of revealing dress that not only debases women but reinforces the lie that a woman s sexuality is what defines her worth There has long been a cultural double standard that expected women to be sexually circumspect while excusing male immorality The unfairness of such a double standard is obvious and it has been justifiably criticized and rejected In that rejection one would have hoped that men would rise to the higher single standard but just the opposite has occurred women and girls are now encouraged to be as promiscuous as the double standard expected men to be Where once women s higher standards demanded commitment and responsibility from men we now have sexual relations without conscience fatherless families and growing poverty Equal opportunity promiscuity simply robs women of their moral influence and degrades all of society 9 In this hollow bargain it is men who are liberated and women and children who suffer most A third area of concern comes from those who in the name of equality want to erase all differences between the masculine and the feminine Often this takes the form of pushing women to adopt more masculine traits be more aggressive tough and confrontational It is now common in movies and video games to see women in terribly violent roles leaving dead bodies and mayhem in their wake It is soul numbing to see men in such roles and certainly no less so when women are the ones perpetrating and suffering the violence Former Young Women general president Margaret D Nadauld taught The world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender There are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind There are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined We have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith We have enough greed we need more goodness We have enough vanity we need more virtue We have enough popularity we need more purity 10 In blurring feminine and masculine differences we lose the distinct complementary gifts of women and men that together produce a greater whole My plea to women and girls today is to protect and cultivate the moral force that is within you Preserve that innate virtue and the unique gifts you bring with you into the world Your intuition is to do good and to be good and as you follow the Holy Spirit your moral authority and influence will grow To the young women I say don t lose that moral force even before you have it in full measure Take particular care that your language is clean not coarse that your dress reflects modesty not vanity and that your conduct manifests purity not promiscuity You cannot lift others to virtue on the one hand if you are entertaining vice on the other Sisters of all your associations it is your relationship with God your Heavenly Father who is the source of your moral power that you must always put first in your life Remember that Jesus s power came through His single minded devotion to the will of the Father He never varied from that which pleased His Father 11 Strive to be that kind of disciple of the Father and the Son and your influence will never fade And do not be afraid to apply that influence without fear or apology Be ready always to give an answer to every man woman and child that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you 12 Preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine 13 Bring up your children in light and truth 14 Teach them to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord 15In these exhortations to women let no one willfully misunderstand By praising and encouraging the moral force in women I am not saying that men and boys are somehow excused from their own duty to stand for truth and righteousness that their responsibility to serve sacrifice and minister is somehow less than that of women or can be left to women Brethren let us stand with women share their burdens and cultivate our own companion moral authority Dear sisters we rely on the moral force you bring to the world to marriage to family to the Church We rely on blessings you bring down from heaven by your prayers and faith We pray for your security welfare and happiness and for your influence to be sustained In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In colonial times labor was in great demand in America During the 18th and early 19th centuries potential immigrant laborers were recruited in Great Britain Germany and other European countries but many who were willing to go could not afford the cost of travel It was not uncommon for these to travel under an indenture or contract promising to work after their arrival for a certain period of time without wages as payment for their passage Others came with the promise that family members already in America would pay their fare upon arrival but if that didn t happen the newcomers were obliged to pay their own costs through indentured service The term used to describe these indentured immigrants was redemptioners They had to redeem the cost of their passage in a sense purchase their freedom by their labor 1Among the most significant of Jesus Christ s descriptive titles is Redeemer As indicated in my brief account of immigrant redemptioners the word redeem means to pay off an obligation or a debt Redeem can also mean to rescue or set free as by paying a ransom If someone commits a mistake and then corrects it or makes amends we say he has redeemed himself Each of these meanings suggests different facets of the great Redemption accomplished by Jesus Christ through His Atonement which includes in the words of the dictionary to deliver from sin and its penalties as by a sacrifice made for the sinner 2The Savior s Redemption has two parts First it atones for Adam s transgression and the consequent Fall of man by overcoming what could be called the direct effects of the Fall physical death and spiritual death Physical death is well understood spiritual death is the separation of man from God In the words of Paul For as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive 1 Corinthians 15 22 This redemption from physical and spiritual death is both universal and without condition 3The second aspect of the Savior s Atonement is redemption from what might be termed the indirect consequences of the Fall our own sins as opposed to Adam s transgression By virtue of the Fall we are born into a mortal world where sin that is disobedience to divinely instituted law is pervasive Speaking of all of us the Lord says Even so when they begin to grow up sin conceiveth in their hearts and they taste the bitter that they may know to prize the good And it is given unto them to know good from evil wherefore they are agents unto themselves Moses 6 55 56 Because we are accountable and we make the choices the redemption from our own sins is conditional conditioned on confessing and abandoning sin and turning to a godly life or in other words conditioned on repentance see D C 58 43 Wherefore commands the Lord teach it unto your children that all men everywhere must repent or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God for no unclean thing can dwell there or dwell in his presence Moses 6 57 The Savior s suffering in Gethsemane and His agony on the cross redeem us from sin by satisfying the demands that justice has upon us He extends mercy and pardons those who repent The Atonement also satisfies the debt justice owes to us by healing and compensating us for any suffering we innocently endure For behold he suffereth the pains of all men yea the pains of every living creature both men women and children who belong to the family of Adam 2 Nephi 9 21 see also Alma 7 11 12 4Inasmuch as we follow Christ we seek to participate in and further His redemptive work The greatest service we can provide to others in this life beginning with those of our own family is to bring them to Christ through faith and repentance so they may experience His Redemption peace and joy now and immortality and eternal life in the world to come The work of our missionaries is a magnificent expression of the Lord s redeeming love As His authorized messengers they offer the incomparable blessings of faith in Jesus Christ repentance baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost opening the way to spiritual rebirth and redemption We can also assist in the Lord s redemption of those beyond the grave The faithful elders of this dispensation when they depart from mortal life continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead D C 138 57 With the benefit of vicarious rites we offer them in the temples of God even those who died in bondage to sin can be freed 5While the most important aspects of redemption have to do with repentance and forgiveness there is a very significant temporal aspect as well Jesus is said to have gone about doing good see Acts 10 38 which included healing the sick and infirm supplying food to hungry multitudes and teaching a more excellent way The Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many Matthew 20 28 So may we under the influence of the Holy Spirit go about doing good in the redemptive pattern of the Master This kind of redemptive work means helping people with their problems It means befriending the poor and the weak alleviating suffering righting wrongs defending truth strengthening the rising generation and achieving security and happiness at home Much of our redemptive work on earth is to help others grow and achieve their just hopes and aspirations An example from Victor Hugo s novel Les Mis rables though fictional has always touched and inspired me Near the beginning of the story Bishop Bienvenu gives food and overnight shelter to the homeless Jean Valjean who has just been released from 19 years in prison for having stolen a loaf of bread to feed his sister s starving children Hardened and embittered Valjean rewards Bishop Bienvenu s kindness by stealing his silver goods Later detained by suspicious gendarmes Valjean falsely claims the silver was a gift to him When the gendarmes drag him back to the bishop s house to Valjean s great surprise Bishop Bienvenu confirms his story and for good effect says But I gave you the candlesticks also which are silver like the rest and would bring two hundred francs Why did you not take them along with your plates The bishop approached him and said in a low voice Forget not never forget that you have promised me to use this silver to become an honest man Jean Valjean who had no recollection of this promise stood confounded The bishop continued solemnly Jean Valjean my brother you belong no longer to evil but to good It is your soul that I am buying for you I withdraw it from dark thoughts and from the spirit of perdition and I give it to God Jean Valjean indeed became a new man an honest man and a benefactor to many Throughout his life he kept the two silver candlesticks to remind him that his life had been redeemed for God 6Some forms of temporal redemption come by collaborative effort It is one of the reasons the Savior created a church Being organized in quorums and auxiliaries and in stakes wards and branches we can not only teach and encourage each other in the gospel but we can also bring to bear people and resources to deal with the exigencies of life People acting alone or in ad hoc groups cannot always provide means on a scale needed to address larger challenges As followers of Jesus Christ we are a community of Saints organized to help redeem the needs of our fellow Saints and as many others as we can reach across the globe Because of our humanitarian efforts mentioned by Elder Dallin H Oaks specifically this past year 890 000 people in 36 countries have clean water 70 000 people in 57 countries have wheelchairs 75 000 people in 25 countries have improved vision and people in 52 countries received aid following natural disasters Acting with others the Church has helped immunize some 8 million children and has helped Syrians in refugee camps in Turkey Lebanon and Jordan with the necessities of life At the same time members of the Church in need received millions of dollars in fast offering and other welfare assistance during 2012 Thank you for your generosity All of this does not begin to count the individual acts of kindness and support gifts of food clothing money care and a thousand other forms of comfort and compassion by which we may participate in the Christlike work of redemption As a boy I witnessed my own mother s actions to redeem a woman in need Many years ago when her children were young my mother underwent a serious operation that nearly took her life and left her bedridden much of the time for nearly a year During this time family and ward members helped Mother and our family For additional help the ward Relief Society president Sister Abraham recommended that my parents hire a woman in the ward who desperately needed work In recounting this story I will use the fictional names Sara and Annie for this woman and her daughter This is my mother s account I can see it as plain as if it were only yesterday There I lay in bed and Sister Abraham brought Sara to the bedroom door My heart sank There stood the least attractive person I had ever met so thin scraggly unkempt hair round shouldered head bowed looking at the floor She wore an old housedress four sizes too big She wouldn t look up and spoke so softly I couldn t hear her Hiding behind her was a little girl about three years old What in the world was I to do with this creature After they left the room I cried and cried I needed help not more problems Sister Abraham stayed awhile with her and they soon whipped the house into shape and prepared some good meals Sister Abraham asked me to try it for a few days saying that this girl had had a really hard time and needed help The next morning when Sara came I finally got her to come over by the bed where I could hear her She asked what I wanted her to do I told her and then said But the most important thing is my boys spend time with them read to them they are more important than the house She was a good cook and kept the house clean the washing done and she was good to the boys Through the weeks I learned Sara s story Because she was hard of hearing she didn t do well in school and eventually dropped out She married young to a dissolute man Annie was born and became the joy of Sara s life One winter night her husband came home drunk forced Sara and Annie into the car in their bedclothes and then dropped them off by the side of the highway They never saw him again Barefoot and freezing Sara and Annie walked several miles to her mother s home Her mother agreed to let them stay in exchange for doing all the housework and cooking and caring for her sister and brother who were in high school We took Sara to an ear doctor and she got a hearing aid We got her to take adult schooling and she got her high school diploma She went to night school and later graduated from college and taught special education She bought a little home Annie was married in the temple and had two children Sara eventually had some operations on her ears and was finally able to hear well Years later she retired and served a mission Sara thanked us often and said she learned so much from me especially when I told her that my sons were more important than the house She said it taught her to be that way with Annie Sara is a very special woman As disciples of Jesus Christ we ought to do all we can to redeem others from suffering and burdens Even so our greatest redemptive service will be to lead them to Christ Without His Redemption from death and from sin we have only a gospel of social justice That may provide some help and reconciliation in the present but it has no power to draw down from heaven perfect justice and infinite mercy Ultimate redemption is in Jesus Christ and in Him alone I humbly and gratefully acknowledge Him as the Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brethren much has been said and written in recent years about the challenges of men and boys A sampling of book titles for example includes Why There Are No Good Men Left The Demise of Guys The End of Men Why Boys Fail and Manning Up Interestingly most of these seem to have been written by women In any case a common thread running through these analyses is that in many societies today men and boys get conflicting and demeaning signals about their roles and value in society The author of Manning Up characterized it this way It s been an almost universal rule of civilization that whereas girls became women simply by reaching physical maturity boys had to pass a test They needed to demonstrate courage physical prowess or mastery of the necessary skills The goal was to prove their competence as protectors of women and children this was always their primary social role Today however with women moving ahead in an advanced economy provider husbands and fathers are now optional and the character qualities men had needed to play their role fortitude stoicism courage fidelity are obsolete and even a little embarrassing 1In their zeal to promote opportunity for women something we applaud there are those who denigrate men and their contributions They seem to think of life as a competition between male and female that one must dominate the other and now it s the women s turn Some argue that a career is everything and marriage and children should be entirely optional therefore why do we need men 2 In too many Hollywood films TV and cable shows and even commercials men are portrayed as incompetent immature or self absorbed This cultural emasculation of males is having a damaging effect In the United States for example it is reported Girls outperform boys now at every level from elementary school through graduate school By eighth grade for instance only 20 percent of boys are proficient in writing and 24 percent proficient in reading Young men s SAT scores meanwhile in 2011 were the worst they ve been in 40 years According to the National Center for Education Statistics NCES boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of both high school and college It is predicted that women will earn 60 percent of bachelor s 63 percent of master s and 54 percent of doctorate degrees by 2016 Two thirds of students in special education remedial programs are guys 3Some men and young men have taken the negative signals as an excuse to avoid responsibility and never really grow up In an observation that is too often accurate one university professor remarked The men come into class with their backward baseball caps and their lame the word processor ate my homework excuses Meanwhile the women are checking their day planners and asking for recommendations for law school 4 One female movie reviewer expressed the rather cynical view that what we can count on men for if we re lucky and we choose to have a partner is to be just that a partner Someone who stands in his own space even as he respects our standing in our own 5Brethren it cannot be this way with us As men of the priesthood we have an essential role to play in society at home and in the Church But we must be men that women can trust that children can trust and that God can trust In the Church and kingdom of God in these latter days we cannot afford to have boys and men who are drifting We cannot afford young men who lack self discipline and live only to be entertained We cannot afford young adult men who are going nowhere in life who are not serious about forming families and making a real contribution in this world We cannot afford husbands and fathers who fail to provide spiritual leadership in the home We cannot afford to have those who exercise the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God waste their strength in pornography or spend their lives in cyberspace ironically being of the world while not being in the world Brethren we have work to do Young men you need to do well in school and then continue your education beyond high school Some of you will want to pursue university studies and careers in business agriculture government or other professions Some will excel in the arts music or teaching Others will choose a military career or learn a trade Over the years I have had a number of craftsmen work on projects and repairs at my home and I have admired the hard work and skill of these men In whatever you choose it is essential that you become proficient so that you can support a family and make a contribution for good in your community and your country I recently saw a video showing a day in the life of a 14 year old young man in India named Amar He gets up early and works two jobs before and after school six and a half days a week His income provides a substantial part of his family s livelihood He hurries home on his worn bicycle from his second job after dark and somehow squeezes in a few hours of homework before dropping onto his bed on the floor between sleeping siblings around eleven o clock at night Although I ve never met him I feel proud of him for his diligence and courage He is doing the very best he can with his limited resources and opportunities and he is a blessing to his family You adult men fathers single adults leaders home teachers be worthy models and help the rising generation of boys become men Teach them social and other skills how to participate in a conversation how to get acquainted and interact with others how to relate to women and girls how to serve how to be active and enjoy recreation how to pursue hobbies without becoming addicted how to correct mistakes and make better choices And so to all who are listening wherever this message may reach you I say as Jehovah said to Joshua Be strong and of a good courage Joshua 1 6 Take heart and prepare the best you can whatever your circumstances Prepare to be a good husband and father prepare to be a good and productive citizen prepare to serve the Lord whose priesthood you hold Wherever you are your Heavenly Father is mindful of you You are not alone and you have the priesthood and the gift of the Holy Ghost Of the many places you are needed one of the very most important is your priesthood quorum We need quorums that provide spiritual nourishment to members on Sunday and that also serve We need leaders of quorums who focus on doing the Lord s work and on supporting quorum members and their families Consider missionary work Young men you have no time to waste You can t wait to get serious about preparing until you are 17 or 18 Aaronic Priesthood quorums can help their members understand the oath and covenant of the priesthood and get ready for ordination as elders they can help them understand and prepare for the ordinances of the temple and they can help them get ready for successful missions Melchizedek Priesthood quorums and the Relief Society can help parents prepare missionaries who know the Book of Mormon and who will go into the field fully committed And in each ward and branch these same quorums can lead out in an effective collaboration with the full time missionaries who are serving there A related work that rests primarily on priesthood shoulders is the Savior s call echoed by President Thomas S Monson to rescue those who have drifted from the gospel or who have become disaffected for any reason We have had wonderful success in this effort including excellent work by young men An Aaronic Priesthood quorum in the Rio Grande Spanish Ward in Albuquerque New Mexico counseled together about whom they could bring back and then as a group went to visit each of them One said When they came to my door I felt important and another confided I feel happy inside that someone actually wants me to go to church it makes me want to go to church now When the quorum members invited one young man to come back they asked him to come with them on the next visit and he did They were not just inviting him to attend church they were immediately making him a part of the quorum Another challenging but stimulating priesthood work is that of family history and the temple Watch for a First Presidency letter arriving shortly that will offer a renewed call and a higher vision of this vital part of the work we have to do Our quorums also form a brotherhood of mutual support President Gordon B Hinckley once said It will be a marvelous day my brethren it will be a day of fulfillment of the purposes of the Lord when our priesthood quorums become an anchor of strength to every man belonging thereto when each such man may appropriately be able to say I am a member of a priesthood quorum of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I stand ready to assist my brethren in all of their needs as I am confident they stand ready to assist me in mine Working together we can stand without embarrassment and without fear against every wind of adversity that might blow be it economic social or spiritual 6Despite our best efforts things don t always work out as we have planned and a particular wind of adversity that can come into a man s life is unemployment An early Church welfare pamphlet stated A man out of work is of special moment to the Church because deprived of his inheritance he is on trial as Job was on trial for his integrity As days lengthen into weeks and months and even years of adversity the hurt grows deeper The Church cannot hope to save a man on Sunday if during the week it is a complacent witness to the crucifixion of his soul 7In April 2009 former Presiding Bishopric counselor Richard C Edgley told the story of an exemplary quorum that mobilized to assist a fellow member who had lost his job Phil s Auto of Centerville Utah is a testament of what priesthood leadership and a quorum can accomplish Phil was a member of an elders quorum and worked as a mechanic at a local automobile repair shop Unfortunately the repair shop where Phil worked experienced economic trouble and had to let Phil go from his job He was devastated by this turn of events On hearing about Phil s job loss his bishop Leon Olsen and his elders quorum presidency prayerfully considered ways they could help Phil get back on his feet After all he was a fellow quorum member a brother and he needed help They concluded that Phil had the skills to run his own business One of the quorum members offered that he had an old barn that perhaps could be used as a repair shop Other quorum members could help gather needed tools and supplies to equip the new shop Almost everyone in the quorum could at least help clean the old barn They shared their ideas with Phil then they shared their plan with the members of their quorum The barn was cleaned and renovated the tools gathered and all was put in order Phil s Auto was a success and eventually moved to better and more permanent quarters all because his quorum brothers offered help in a time of crisis 8Of course as has been repeated by prophets over the years The most important of the Lord s work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes 9 We have much to do to strengthen marriage in societies that increasingly trivialize its importance and purpose We have much to do to teach our children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord D C 68 28 Our task is nothing less than to help our children experience the mighty change of heart or conversion to the Lord spoken of so eloquently in the Book of Mormon see Mosiah 5 1 12 Alma 26 Together with the Relief Society priesthood quorums can build up parents and marriages and quorums can provide the blessings of the priesthood to single parent families Yes brethren we have work to do Thank you for the sacrifices you make and the good you do Keep going and the Lord will help you At times you may not know quite what to do or what to say just move forward Begin to act and the Lord assures that an effectual door shall be opened for you D C 118 3 Begin to speak and He promises You shall not be confounded before men for it shall be given you in the very hour yea in the very moment what ye shall say D C 100 5 6 It is true that we are in many ways ordinary and imperfect but we have a perfect Master who wrought a perfect Atonement and we have call upon His grace and His priesthood As we repent and purge our souls we are promised that we will be taught and endowed with power from on high see D C 43 16 The Church and the world and women are crying for men men who are developing their capacity and talents who are willing to work and make sacrifices who will help others achieve happiness and salvation They are crying Rise up O men of God 10 God help us to do it In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Our deepest gratitude and love to Sister Beck Sister Allred and Sister Thompson and the Relief Society board We have seen of late a growing public interest in the beliefs of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints This is something we welcome because after all our fundamental commission is to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ His doctrine in all the world see Matthew 28 19 20 D C 112 28 But we must admit there has been and still persists some confusion about our doctrine and how it is established That is the subject I wish to address today The Savior taught His doctrine in the meridian of time and His Apostles struggled mightily to preserve it against a barrage of false tradition and philosophy New Testament Epistles cite numerous incidents demonstrating that serious and widespread apostasy was already under way during the Apostles ministry 1The centuries that followed were illuminated by occasional rays of gospel light until in the 19th century a brilliant dawn of Restoration broke upon the world and the gospel of Christ full and complete was once again upon the earth This glorious day began when in a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun Joseph Smith History 1 16 God the Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ visited young Joseph Smith and initiated what would become a virtual flood of revelation linked with divine power and authority In these revelations we find what might be termed the core doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ reestablished upon the earth Jesus Himself defined that doctrine in these words recorded in the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ This is my doctrine and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me and I bear record of the Father and the Father beareth record of me and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men everywhere to repent and believe in me And whoso believeth in me and is baptized the same shall be saved and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God And whoso believeth not in me and is not baptized shall be damned And whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also and unto him will the Father bear record of me for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost Verily verily I say unto you that this is my doctrine and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them 3 Nephi 11 32 35 39 This is our message the rock upon which we build the foundation of everything else in the Church Like all that comes from God this doctrine is pure it is clear it is easy to understand even for a child With glad hearts we invite all to receive it In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints we believe all that God has revealed all that He does now reveal and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God Articles of Faith 1 9 This is to say that while there is much we do not yet know the truths and doctrine we have received have come and will continue to come by divine revelation In some faith traditions theologians claim equal teaching authority with the ecclesiastical hierarchy and doctrinal matters may become a contest of opinions between them Some rely on the ecumenical councils of the Middle Ages and their creeds Others place primary emphasis on the reasoning of post apostolic theologians or on biblical hermeneutics and exegesis We value scholarship that enhances understanding but in the Church today just as anciently establishing the doctrine of Christ or correcting doctrinal deviations is a matter of divine revelation to those the Lord endows with apostolic authority 2In 1954 President J Reuben Clark Jr then a counselor in the First Presidency explained how doctrine is promulgated in the Church and the preeminent role of the President of the Church Speaking of members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles he stated We should bear in mind that some of the General Authorities have had assigned to them a special calling they possess a special gift they are sustained as prophets seers and revelators which gives them a special spiritual endowment in connection with their teaching of the people They have the right the power and authority to declare the mind and will of God to his people subject to the over all power and authority of the President of the Church Others of the General Authorities are not given this special spiritual endowment and authority covering their teaching they have a resulting limitation and the resulting limitation upon their power and authority in teaching applies to every other officer and member of the Church for none of them is spiritually endowed as a prophet seer and revelator Furthermore as just indicated the President of the Church has a further and special spiritual endowment in this respect for he is the Prophet Seer and Revelator for the whole Church 3How does the Savior reveal His will and doctrine to prophets seers and revelators He may act by messenger or in His own person He may speak by His own voice or by the voice of the Holy Spirit a communication of Spirit to spirit that may be expressed in words or in feelings that convey understanding beyond words see 1 Nephi 17 45 D C 9 8 He may direct Himself to His servants individually or acting in council see 3 Nephi 27 1 8 I cite two illustrations from the New Testament The first was a revelation directed to the head of the Church Early in the book of Acts we find the Apostles of Christ declaring the gospel message only to Jews following the pattern of Jesus s ministry see Matthew 15 24 but now in the Lord s timetable the time had come for a change In Joppa Peter had a dream in which he saw a variety of animals lowered to earth from heaven in a great sheet knit at the four corners Acts 10 11 and was commanded to kill and eat Acts 10 13 Peter was reluctant since at least some of the animals were unclean under the law of Moses and Peter had never violated the commandment against eating such Nevertheless the voice said to Peter in his dream What God hath cleansed that call not thou common Acts 10 15 The meaning of this dream became clear when soon afterward several men sent from the Roman centurion Cornelius arrived at Peter s lodging with a request that he come teach their master Cornelius had gathered a sizable group of relatives and friends and finding them expectantly waiting to receive his message Peter said God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons But in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him Acts 10 28 34 35 see also verses 17 24 While Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word And they who accompanied Peter were astonished because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost Then answered Peter Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we Acts 10 44 47 By this experience and revelation to Peter the Lord modified the practice of the Church and revealed a more complete doctrinal understanding to His disciples And so the preaching of the gospel expanded to encompass all mankind Later in the book of Acts we find another somewhat related illustration this time showing how revelation on matters of doctrine may come in a council setting A controversy arose about whether circumcision required under the law of Moses should carry over as a commandment in the gospel and Church of Christ see Acts 15 1 5 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider this matter Acts 15 6 Our record of this council is certainly incomplete but we are told that after much disputing Acts 15 7 Peter the senior Apostle rose up and declared what the Holy Spirit had confirmed to him He reminded the council that when the gospel began to be preached to the uncircumcised Gentiles in the house of Cornelius they received the Holy Ghost just as had the circumcised Jewish converts God he said put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they Acts 15 9 11 see also verse 8 After Paul Barnabas and perhaps others spoke in support of Peter s declaration James moved that the decision be implemented by letter to the Church and the council was united with one accord Acts 15 25 see also verses 12 23 In the letter announcing their decision the Apostles said It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us Acts 15 28 or in other words this decision came by divine revelation through the Holy Spirit These same patterns are followed today in the restored Church of Jesus Christ The President of the Church may announce or interpret doctrines based on revelation to him see for example D C 138 Doctrinal exposition may also come through the combined council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles see for example Official Declaration 2 Council deliberations will often include a weighing of canonized scriptures the teachings of Church leaders and past practice But in the end just as in the New Testament Church the objective is not simply consensus among council members but revelation from God It is a process involving both reason and faith for obtaining the mind and will of the Lord 4At the same time it should be remembered that not every statement made by a Church leader past or present necessarily constitutes doctrine It is commonly understood in the Church that a statement made by one leader on a single occasion often represents a personal though well considered opinion not meant to be official or binding for the whole Church The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that a prophet is a prophet only when he is acting as such 5 President Clark quoted earlier observed To this point runs a simple story my father told me as a boy I do not know on what authority but it illustrates the point His story was that during the excitement incident to the coming of Johnston s Army Brother Brigham preached to the people in a morning meeting a sermon vibrant with defiance to the approaching army and declaring an intention to oppose and drive them back In the afternoon meeting he arose and said that Brigham Young had been talking in the morning but the Lord was going to talk now He then delivered an address the tempo of which was the opposite from the morning talk The Church will know by the testimony of the Holy Ghost in the body of the members whether the brethren in voicing their views are moved upon by the Holy Ghost and in due time that knowledge will be made manifest 6The Prophet Joseph Smith confirmed the Savior s central role in our doctrine in one definitive sentence The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ that He died was buried and rose again the third day and ascended into heaven and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it 7 Joseph Smith s testimony of Jesus is that He lives for he saw him even on the right hand of God and he heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father D C 76 23 see also verse 22 I appeal to all who hear or read this message to seek through prayer and study of the scriptures that same witness of the divine character the Atonement and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ Accept His doctrine by repenting being baptized receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost and then throughout your life following the laws and covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ As our Easter celebration approaches I express my own witness that Jesus of Nazareth was and is the Son of God the very Messiah of ancient prophecy He is the Christ who suffered in Gethsemane died on the cross was buried and who indeed rose again the third day He is the resurrected Lord through whom we shall all be resurrected and by whom all who will may be redeemed and exalted in His heavenly kingdom This is our doctrine confirming all prior testaments of Jesus Christ and stated anew for our own time In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Book of Mormon contains the account of a man named Nehor It is easy to understand why Mormon in abridging a thousand years of Nephite records thought it important to include something about this man and the enduring influence of his doctrine Mormon was seeking to warn us knowing that this philosophy would surface again in our day Nehor appeared on the scene about 90 years before the birth of Christ He taught that all mankind should be saved at the last day for the Lord had created all men and had also redeemed all men and in the end all men should have eternal life Alma 1 4 About 15 years later Korihor came among the Nephites preaching and amplifying the doctrine of Nehor The Book of Mormon records that he was Anti Christ for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies concerning the coming of Christ Alma 30 6 Korihor s preaching was to the effect that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature therefore every man prospered according to his genius and that every man conquered according to his strength and whatsoever a man did was no crime Alma 30 17 These false prophets and their followers did not believe in the repentance of their sins Alma 15 15 As in the days of Nehor and Korihor we live in a time not long before the advent of Jesus Christ in our case the time of preparation for His Second Coming And similarly the message of repentance is often not welcomed Some profess that if there is a God He makes no real demands upon us see Alma 18 5 Others maintain that a loving God forgives all sin based on simple confession or if there actually is a punishment for sin God will beat us with a few stripes and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God 2 Nephi 28 8 Others with Korihor deny the very existence of Christ and any such thing as sin Their doctrine is that values standards and even truth are all relative Thus whatever one feels is right for him or her cannot be judged by others to be wrong or sinful On the surface such philosophies seem appealing because they give us license to indulge any appetite or desire without concern for consequences By using the teachings of Nehor and Korihor we can rationalize and justify anything When prophets come crying repentance it throws cold water on the party But in reality the prophetic call should be received with joy Without repentance there is no real progress or improvement in life Pretending there is no sin does not lessen its burden and pain Suffering for sin does not by itself change anything for the better Only repentance leads to the sunlit uplands of a better life And of course only through repentance do we gain access to the atoning grace of Jesus Christ and salvation Repentance is a divine gift and there should be a smile on our faces when we speak of it It points us to freedom confidence and peace Rather than interrupting the celebration the gift of repentance is the cause for true celebration Repentance exists as an option only because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ It is His infinite sacrifice that bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance Alma 34 15 Repentance is the necessary condition and the grace of Christ is the power by which mercy can satisfy the demands of justice Alma 34 16 Our witness is this We know that justification or forgiveness of sins through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true And we know also that sanctification or purification from the effects of sin through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true to all those who love and serve God with all their mights minds and strength D C 20 30 31 Repentance is an expansive subject but today I would like to mention just five aspects of this fundamental gospel principle that I hope will be helpful First the invitation to repent is an expression of love When the Savior began to preach and to say Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand Matthew 4 17 it was a message of love inviting all who would to qualify to join Him and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world and eternal life itself in the world to come Moses 6 59 If we do not invite others to change or if we do not demand repentance of ourselves we fail in a fundamental duty we owe to one another and to ourselves A permissive parent an indulgent friend a fearful Church leader are in reality more concerned about themselves than the welfare and happiness of those they could help Yes the call to repentance is at times regarded as intolerant or offensive and may even be resented but guided by the Spirit it is in reality an act of genuine caring see D C 121 43 44 Second repentance means striving to change It would mock the Savior s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross for us to expect that He should transform us into angelic beings with no real effort on our part Rather we seek His grace to complement and reward our most diligent efforts see 2 Nephi 25 23 Perhaps as much as praying for mercy we should pray for time and opportunity to work and strive and overcome Surely the Lord smiles upon one who desires to come to judgment worthily who resolutely labors day by day to replace weakness with strength Real repentance real change may require repeated attempts but there is something refining and holy in such striving Divine forgiveness and healing flow quite naturally to such a soul for indeed virtue loveth virtue light cleaveth unto light and mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own D C 88 40 With repentance we can steadily improve in our capacity to live the celestial law for we recognize that he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory D C 88 22 Third repentance means not only abandoning sin but also committing to obedience The Bible Dictionary states Repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God as well as a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined 1 One of several examples of this teaching from the Book of Mormon is found in the words of Alma to one of his sons Therefore I command you my son in the fear of God that ye refrain from your iniquities That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind might and strength Alma 39 12 13 see also Mosiah 7 33 3 Nephi 20 26 Mormon 9 6 For our turning to the Lord to be complete it must include nothing less than a covenant of obedience to Him We often speak of this covenant as the baptismal covenant since it is witnessed by being baptized in water see Mosiah 18 10 The Savior s own baptism providing the example confirmed His covenant of obedience to the Father But notwithstanding he being holy he showeth unto the children of men that according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments 2 Nephi 31 7 Without this covenant repentance remains incomplete and the remission of sins unattained 2 In the memorable expression of Professor Noel Reynolds The choice to repent is a choice to burn bridges in every direction having determined to follow forever only one way the one path that leads to eternal life 3Fourth repentance requires a seriousness of purpose and a willingness to persevere even through pain Attempts to create a list of specific steps of repentance may be helpful to some but it may also lead to a mechanical check off the boxes approach with no real feeling or change True repentance is not superficial The Lord gives two overarching requirements By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins behold he will confess them and forsake them D C 58 43 Confessing and forsaking are powerful concepts They are much more than a casual I admit it I m sorry Confession is a deep sometimes agonizing acknowledgment of error and offense to God and man Sorrow and regret and bitter tears often accompany one s confession especially when his or her actions have been the cause of pain to someone or worse have led another into sin It is this deep distress this view of things as they really are that leads one as Alma to cry out O Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me who am in the gall of bitterness and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death Alma 36 18 With faith in the merciful Redeemer and His power potential despair turns to hope One s very heart and desires change and the once appealing sin becomes increasingly abhorrent A resolve to abandon and forsake the sin and to repair as fully as one possibly can the damage he or she has caused now forms in that new heart This resolve soon matures into a covenant of obedience to God With that covenant in place the Holy Ghost the messenger of divine grace will bring relief and forgiveness One is moved to declare again with Alma And oh what joy and what marvelous light I do behold yea my soul is filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain Alma 36 20 Any pain entailed in repentance will always be far less than the suffering required to satisfy justice for unresolved transgression The Savior spoke little about what He endured to satisfy the demands of justice and atone for our sins but He did make this revealing statement For behold I God have suffered these things for all that they might not suffer if they would repent But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I Which suffering caused myself even God the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore and to suffer both body and spirit and would that I might not drink the bitter cup D C 19 16 18 Fifth whatever the cost of repentance it is swallowed up in the joy of forgiveness In a general conference address entitled The Brilliant Morning of Forgiveness President Boyd K Packer provided this analogy In April of 1847 Brigham Young led the first company of pioneers out of Winter Quarters At that same time 1 600 miles 2 575 km to the west the pathetic survivors of the Donner Party straggled down the slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains into the Sacramento Valley They had spent the ferocious winter trapped in the snowdrifts below the summit That any survived the days and weeks and months of starvation and indescribable suffering is almost beyond belief Among them was fifteen year old John Breen On the night of April 24 he walked into Johnson s Ranch Years later John wrote It was long after dark when we got to Johnson s Ranch so the first time I saw it was early in the morning The weather was fine the ground was covered with green grass the birds were singing from the tops of the trees and the journey was over I could scarcely believe that I was alive The scene that I saw that morning seems to be photographed on my mind Most of the incidents are gone from memory but I can always see the camp near Johnson s Ranch Said President Packer At first I was very puzzled by his statement that most of the incidents are gone from memory How could long months of incredible suffering and sorrow ever be gone from his mind How could that brutal dark winter be replaced with one brilliant morning On further reflection I decided it was not puzzling at all I have seen something similar happen to people I have known I have seen some who have spent a long winter of guilt and spiritual starvation emerge into the morning of forgiveness When morning came they learned this Behold he who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and I the Lord remember them no more D C 58 42 4I gratefully acknowledge and testify that the incomprehensible suffering death and Resurrection of our Lord bringeth to pass the condition of repentance Helaman 14 18 The divine gift of repentance is the key to happiness here and hereafter In the Savior s words and in deep humility and love I invite all to repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand Matthew 4 17 I know that in accepting this invitation you will find joy both now and forever In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Our Heavenly Father is a God of high expectations His expectations for us are expressed by His Son Jesus Christ in these words I would that ye should be perfect even as I or your Father who is in heaven is perfect 3 Nephi 12 48 He proposes to make us holy so that we may abide a celestial glory D C 88 22 and dwell in his presence Moses 6 57 He knows what is required and so to make our transformation possible He provides His commandments and covenants the gift of the Holy Ghost and most important the Atonement and Resurrection of His Beloved Son In all of this God s purpose is that we His children may be able to experience ultimate joy to be with Him eternally and to become even as He is Some years ago Elder Dallin H Oaks explained The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts what we have done It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts what we have become It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions The commandments ordinances and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become 1Sadly much of modern Christianity does not acknowledge that God makes any real demands on those who believe in Him seeing Him rather as a butler who meets their needs when summoned or a therapist whose role is to help people feel good about themselves 2 It is a religious outlook that makes no pretense at changing lives 3 By contrast as one author declares the God portrayed in both the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures asks not just for commitment but for our very lives The God of the Bible traffics in life and death not niceness and calls for sacrificial love not benign whatever ism 4I would like to speak of one particular attitude and practice we need to adopt if we are to meet our Heavenly Father s high expectations It is this willingly to accept and even seek correction Correction is vital if we would conform our lives unto a perfect man that is unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ Ephesians 4 13 Paul said of divine correction or chastening For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth Hebrews 12 6 Though it is often difficult to endure truly we ought to rejoice that God considers us worth the time and trouble to correct Divine chastening has at least three purposes 1 to persuade us to repent 2 to refine and sanctify us and 3 at times to redirect our course in life to what God knows is a better path Consider first of all repentance the necessary condition for forgiveness and cleansing The Lord declared As many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent Revelation 3 19 Again He said And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience if it must needs be by the things which they suffer D C 105 6 see also D C 1 27 In a latter day revelation the Lord commanded four senior Church leaders to repent as He might command many of us for not adequately teaching their children according to the commandments and for not being more diligent and concerned at home see D C 93 41 50 The brother of Jared in the Book of Mormon repented when the Lord stood in a cloud and talked with him for the space of three hours and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord Ether 2 14 Because he so willingly responded to this severe rebuke the brother of Jared was later given the privilege of seeing and being instructed by the premortal Redeemer see Ether 3 6 20 The fruit of God s chastisement is repentance leading to righteousness see Hebrews 12 11 In addition to stimulating our repentance the very experience of enduring chastening can refine us and prepare us for greater spiritual privileges Said the Lord My people must be tried in all things that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them even the glory of Zion and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom D C 136 31 In another place He said For all those who will not endure chastening but deny me cannot be sanctified D C 101 5 see also Hebrews 12 10 As Elder Paul V Johnson said this morning we should take care not to resent the very things that help us put on the divine nature The followers of Alma established a Zion community in Helam but then were brought into bondage They did not deserve their suffering quite the contrary but the record says Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people yea he trieth their patience and their faith Nevertheless whosoever putteth his trust in him the same shall be lifted up at the last day Yea and thus it was with this people Mosiah 23 21 22 The Lord strengthened them and lightened their burdens to the point they could hardly feel them upon their backs and then in due course delivered them see Mosiah 24 8 22 Their faith was immeasurably strengthened by their experience and ever after they enjoyed a special bond with the Lord God uses another form of chastening or correction to guide us to a future we do not or cannot now envision but which He knows is the better way for us President Hugh B Brown formerly a member of the Twelve and a counselor in the First Presidency provided a personal experience He told of purchasing a rundown farm in Canada many years ago As he went about cleaning up and repairing his property he came across a currant bush that had grown over six feet 1 8 m high and was yielding no berries so he pruned it back drastically leaving only small stumps Then he saw a drop like a tear on the top of each of these little stumps as if the currant bush were crying and thought he heard it say How could you do this to me I was making such wonderful growth And now you have cut me down Every plant in the garden will look down on me How could you do this to me I thought you were the gardener here President Brown replied Look little currant bush I am the gardener here and I know what I want you to be I didn t intend you to be a fruit tree or a shade tree I want you to be a currant bush and someday little currant bush when you are laden with fruit you are going to say Thank you Mr Gardener for loving me enough to cut me down Years later President Brown was a field officer in the Canadian Army serving in England When a superior officer became a battle casualty President Brown was in line to be promoted to general and he was summoned to London But even though he was fully qualified for the promotion it was denied him because he was a Mormon The commanding general said in essence You deserve the appointment but I cannot give it to you What President Brown had spent 10 years hoping praying and preparing for slipped through his fingers in that moment because of blatant discrimination Continuing his story President Brown remembered I got on the train and started back with a broken heart with bitterness in my soul When I got to my tent I threw my cap on the cot I clenched my fists and I shook them at heaven I said How could you do this to me God I have done everything I could do to measure up There is nothing that I could have done that I should have done that I haven t done How could you do this to me I was as bitter as gall And then I heard a voice and I recognized the tone of this voice It was my own voice and the voice said I am the gardener here I know what I want you to do The bitterness went out of my soul and I fell on my knees by the cot to ask forgiveness for my ungratefulness And now almost 50 years later I look up to God and say Thank you Mr Gardener for cutting me down for loving me enough to hurt me 5God knew what Hugh B Brown was to become and what was needed for that to happen and He redirected his course to prepare him for the holy apostleship If we sincerely desire and strive to measure up to the high expectations of our Heavenly Father He will ensure that we receive all the help we need whether it be comforting strengthening or chastening If we are open to it needed correction will come in many forms and from many sources It may come in the course of our prayers as God speaks to our mind and heart through the Holy Ghost see D C 8 2 It may come in the form of prayers that are answered no or differently than we had expected Chastening may come as we study the scriptures and are reminded of deficiencies disobedience or simply matters neglected Correction can come through others especially those who are God inspired to promote our happiness Apostles prophets patriarchs bishops and others have been put into the Church today just as anciently for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ Ephesians 4 12 Perhaps some of the things said in this conference have come to you as a call to repentance or change which if heeded will lift you to a higher place We can help one another as fellow Church members it is one of the primary reasons that the Savior established a church Even when we encounter mean spirited criticism from persons who have little regard or love for us it can be helpful to exercise enough meekness to weigh it and sift out anything that might benefit us Correction hopefully gentle can come from one s spouse Elder Richard G Scott who just addressed us remembers a time early in his marriage when his wife Jeanene counseled him to look directly at people when he spoke to them You look at the floor the ceiling the window anywhere but in their eyes she said He took that gentle rebuke to heart and it made him much more effective in counseling and working with people As one who served as a full time missionary under then President Scott s direction I can attest that he does look one squarely in the eye in his conversations I can also add that when one needs correction that look can be very penetrating Parents can and must correct even chasten if their children are not to be cast adrift at the mercy of a merciless adversary and his supporters President Boyd K Packer has observed that when a person in a position to correct another fails to do so he is thinking of himself Remember that reproof should be timely with sharpness or clarity when moved upon by the Holy Ghost and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy D C 121 43 Remember that if we resist correction others may discontinue offering it altogether despite their love for us If we repeatedly fail to act on the chastening of a loving God then He too will desist He has said My Spirit will not always strive with man Ether 2 15 Eventually much of our chastening should come from within we should become self correcting One of the ways that our late beloved colleague Elder Joseph B Wirthlin became the pure and humble disciple that he was was by analyzing his performance in every assignment and task In his desire to please God he resolved to determine what he could have done better and then he diligently applied each lesson learned All of us can meet God s high expectations however great or small our capacity and talent may be Moroni affirms If ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love God with all your might mind and strength then is God s grace sufficient for you that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ Moroni 10 32 It is a diligent devoted effort on our part that calls forth this empowering and enabling grace an effort that certainly includes submission to God s chastening hand and sincere unqualified repentance Let us pray for His love inspired correction May God sustain you in your striving to meet His high expectations and grant you a full measure of the happiness and peace that naturally follow I know that you and I can become one with God and Christ Of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son and the joyous potential we have because of Them I humbly and confidently bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As a youth I visited the 1964 World s Fair in New York City One of my favorite stops was the LDS Church pavilion with its impressive replica of the Salt Lake Temple spires There for the first time I saw the film Man s Search for Happiness The movie s depiction of the plan of salvation narrated by Elder Richard L Evans had a significant impact on many visitors including me Among other things Elder Evans said Life offers you two precious gifts one is time the other freedom of choice the freedom to buy with your time what you will You are free to exchange your allotment of time for thrills You may trade it for base desires You may invest it in greed Yours is the freedom to choose But these are no bargains for in them you find no lasting satisfaction Every day every hour every minute of your span of mortal years must sometime be accounted for And it is in this life that you walk by faith and prove yourself able to choose good over evil right over wrong enduring happiness over mere amusement And your eternal reward will be according to your choosing A prophet of God has said Men are that they might have joy a joy that includes a fullness of life a life dedicated to service to love and harmony in the home and the fruits of honest toil an acceptance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ of its requirements and commandments Only in these will you find true happiness the happiness which doesn t fade with the lights and the music and the crowds 1These statements express the reality that our life on earth is a stewardship of time and choices granted by our Creator The word stewardship calls to mind the Lord s law of consecration see for example D C 42 32 53 which has an economic role but more than that is an application of celestial law to life here and now see D C 105 5 To consecrate is to set apart or dedicate something as sacred devoted to holy purposes True success in this life comes in consecrating our lives that is our time and choices to God s purposes see John 17 1 4 D C 19 19 In so doing we permit Him to raise us to our highest destiny I would like to consider with you five of the elements of a consecrated life purity work respect for one s physical body service and integrity As the Savior demonstrated the consecrated life is a pure life While Jesus is the only one to have led a sinless life those who come unto Him and take His yoke upon them have claim on His grace which will make them as He is guiltless and spotless With deep love the Lord encourages us in these words Repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day 3 Nephi 27 20 Consecration therefore means repentance Stubbornness rebellion and rationalization must be abandoned and in their place submission a desire for correction and acceptance of all that the Lord may require This is what King Benjamin called putting off the natural man yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and becoming a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord Mosiah 3 19 Such a one is promised the enduring presence of the Holy Spirit a promise remembered and renewed each time a repentant soul partakes of the sacrament of the Lord s Supper see D C 20 77 79 Elder B H Roberts once expressed the process in these words The man who so walks in the light and wisdom and power of God will at the last by the very force of association make the light and wisdom and power of God his own weaving those bright rays into a chain divine linking himself forever to God and God to him This is the sum of Messiah s mystic words Thou Father in me and I in thee beyond this human greatness cannot achieve 2A consecrated life is a life of labor Beginning early in His life Jesus was about His Father s business see Luke 2 48 49 God Himself is glorified by His work of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children see Moses 1 39 We naturally desire to participate with Him in His work and in so doing we ought to recognize that all honest work is the work of God In the words of Thomas Carlyle All true Work is sacred in all true Work were it but true hand labour there is something of divineness Labour wide as the Earth has its summit in Heaven 3God has designed this mortal existence to require nearly constant exertion I recall the Prophet Joseph Smith s simple statement By continuous labor we were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance Joseph Smith History 1 55 By work we sustain and enrich life It enables us to survive the disappointments and tragedies of the mortal experience Hard earned achievement brings a sense of self worth Work builds and refines character creates beauty and is the instrument of our service to one another and to God A consecrated life is filled with work sometimes repetitive sometimes menial sometimes unappreciated but always work that improves orders sustains lifts ministers aspires Having spoken in praise of labor I must also add a kind word for leisure Just as honest toil gives rest its sweetness wholesome recreation is the friend and steadying companion of work Music literature art dance drama athletics all can provide entertainment to enrich one s life and further consecrate it At the same time it hardly needs to be said that much of what passes for entertainment today is coarse degrading violent mind numbing and time wasting Ironically it sometimes takes hard work to find wholesome leisure When entertainment turns from virtue to vice it becomes a destroyer of the consecrated life Wherefore take heed that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God Moroni 7 14 A consecrated life respects the incomparable gift of one s physical body a divine creation in the very image of God A central purpose of the mortal experience is that each spirit should receive such a body and learn to exercise moral agency in a tabernacle of flesh A physical body is also essential for exaltation which comes only in the perfect combination of the physical and the spiritual as we see in our beloved resurrected Lord In this fallen world some lives will be painfully brief some bodies will be malformed broken or barely adequate to maintain life yet life will be long enough for each spirit and each body will qualify for resurrection Those who believe that our bodies are nothing more than the result of evolutionary chance will feel no accountability to God or anyone else for what they do with or to their body We who have a witness of the broader reality of premortal mortal and postmortal eternity however must acknowledge that we have a duty to God with respect to this crowning achievement of His physical creation In Paul s words What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own For ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God s 1 Corinthians 6 19 20 Acknowledging these truths and the direction of President Thomas S Monson in last April s general conference we would certainly not deface our body as with tattoos or debilitate it as with drugs or defile it as with fornication adultery or immodesty 4 As our body is the instrument of our spirit it is vital that we care for it as best we can We should consecrate its powers to serve and further the work of Christ Said Paul I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God Romans 12 1 Jesus demonstrated that a consecrated life is a life of service Hours before the agony of His Atonement began the Lord humbly washed His disciples feet saying to them If I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another s feet For I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you Verily verily I say unto you The servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him John 13 14 16 Those who quietly and thoughtfully go about doing good offer a model of consecration No one in our time more perfectly incorporates this trait into daily life than President Thomas S Monson He has cultivated a listening ear that can discern even the faintest whisper of the Spirit signaling the need of someone he can reach and help Often it is in simple acts that confirm divine love and awareness but always always Thomas Monson responds I find in the life of my grandfather and grandmother Alexander DeWitt and Louise Vickery Christofferson an instance of such consecration Grandpa was a strong man and was good at shearing sheep in the days before electric clippers He got good enough he said that in one day I sheared 287 sheep and could have sheared over 300 but we ran out of sheep During 1919 he sheared over 12 000 sheep earning some 2 000 The money would have substantially expanded his farm and upgraded his home but a call to serve in the Southern States Mission came from the Brethren and with Louise s full support he accepted He left his wife then pregnant with their first son my father and their three daughters with the sheep shearing money Upon his joyous return two years later he observed Our savings had lasted us throughout the two years and we had 29 left A consecrated life is a life of integrity We see it in the husband and wife who honor marital vows with complete fidelity 5 We see it in the father and mother whose demonstrated first priority is to nourish their marriage and ensure the physical and spiritual welfare of their children We see it in those who are honest Years ago I became acquainted with two families in the process of dissolving a jointly owned commercial enterprise The principals two men who were friends and members of the same Christian congregation had formed the company years earlier They had a generally congenial relationship as business partners but as they grew older and the next generation began to take part in the business conflicts emerged Finally all parties decided it would be best to divide up the assets and go their separate ways One of the two original partners devised a stratagem with his lawyers to secure for himself a significant financial advantage in the dissolution at the expense of the other partner and his sons In a meeting of the parties one of the sons complained about this unfair treatment and appealed to the honor and Christian beliefs of the first partner You know this is not right he said How could you take advantage of someone this way especially a brother in the same church The first partner s lawyer retorted Oh grow up How can you be so naive Integrity is not naivet What is naive is to suppose that we are not accountable to God The Savior declared My Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father to stand before me to be judged of their works whether they be good or whether they be evil 3 Nephi 27 14 One who lives a consecrated life does not seek to take advantage of another but if anything will turn the other cheek and if required to deliver a coat will give the cloak also see Matthew 5 39 40 The Savior s sternest rebukes were to hypocrites Hypocrisy is terribly destructive not only to the hypocrite but also to those who observe or know of his or her conduct especially children It is faith destroying whereas honor is the rich soil in which the seed of faith thrives A consecrated life is a beautiful thing Its strength and serenity are as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land by a pure stream that yieldeth much precious fruit D C 97 9 Of particular significance is the influence of a consecrated man or woman upon others especially those closest and dearest The consecration of many who have gone before us and others who live among us has helped lay the foundation for our happiness In like manner future generations will take courage from your consecrated life acknowledging their debt to you for the possession of all that truly matters May we consecrate ourselves as sons and daughters of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope Moroni 7 48 see also 1 John 3 2 I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On October 6 in the year 1536 a pitiful figure was led from a dungeon in Vilvorde Castle near Brussels Belgium For nearly a year and a half the man had suffered isolation in a dark damp cell Now outside the castle wall the prisoner was fastened to a post He had time to utter aloud his final prayer Lord open the king of England s eyes and then he was strangled Immediately his body was burned at the stake Who was this man and what was the offense for which both political and ecclesiastical authorities had condemned him His name was William Tyndale and his crime was to have translated and published the Bible in English Tyndale born in England about the time Columbus sailed to the new world was educated at Oxford and Cambridge and then became a member of the Catholic clergy He was fluent in eight languages including Greek Hebrew and Latin Tyndale was a devoted student of the Bible and the pervasive ignorance of the scriptures that he observed in both priests and lay people troubled him deeply In a heated exchange with a cleric who argued against putting scripture in the hands of the common man Tyndale vowed If God spare my life ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the Scripture than thou dost He sought the approval of church authorities to prepare a translation of the Bible in English so that all could read and apply the word of God It was denied the prevailing view being that direct access to the scriptures by any but the clergy threatened the authority of the church and was tantamount to casting pearls before swine Matthew 7 6 Tyndale nevertheless undertook the challenging work of translation In 1524 he traveled to Germany under an assumed name where he lived much of the time in hiding under constant threat of arrest With the help of committed friends Tyndale was able to publish English translations of the New Testament and later the Old Testament The Bibles were smuggled into England where they were in great demand and much prized by those who could get them They were shared widely but in secret The authorities burned all the copies they could find Nevertheless within three years of Tyndale s death God did indeed open King Henry VIII s eyes and with publication of what was called the Great Bible the scriptures in English began to be publicly available Tyndale s work became the foundation for almost all future English translations of the Bible most notably the King James Version 1William Tyndale was not the first nor the last of those who in many countries and languages have sacrificed even to the point of death to bring the word of God out of obscurity We owe them all a great debt of gratitude We owe perhaps an even greater debt to those who faithfully recorded and preserved the word through the ages often with painstaking labor and sacrifice Moses Isaiah Abraham John Paul Nephi Mormon Joseph Smith and many others What did they know about the importance of scriptures that we also need to know What did people in 16th century England who paid enormous sums and ran grave personal risks for access to a Bible understand that we should also understand Not long before his death the prophet Alma entrusted the sacred records of the people to his son Helaman He reminded Helaman that the scriptures had enlarged the memory of this people yea and convinced many of the error of their ways and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls Alma 37 8 He commanded Helaman to preserve the records so that through them God might show forth his power unto future generations Alma 37 14 Through the scriptures God does indeed show forth his power to save and exalt His children By His word as Alma said He enlarges our memory sheds light on falsehood and error and brings us to repentance and to rejoice in Jesus Christ our Redeemer The Scriptures Enlarge Our MemoryThe scriptures enlarge our memory by helping us always to remember the Lord and our relationship to Him and the Father They remind us of what we knew in our premortal life And they expand our memory in another sense by teaching us about epochs people and events that we did not experience personally None of us was present to see the Red Sea part and cross with Moses between walls of water to the other side We were not there to hear the Sermon on the Mount to see Lazarus raised from the dead to see the suffering Savior in Gethsemane and on the cross and we did not with Mary hear the two angels testify at the empty tomb that Jesus was risen from the dead You and I did not go forward one by one with the multitude in the land Bountiful at the resurrected Savior s invitation to feel the prints of the nails and bathe His feet with our tears We did not kneel beside Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove and gaze there upon the Father and the Son Yet we know all these things and much much more because we have the scriptural record to enlarge our memory to teach us what we did not know And as these things penetrate our minds and hearts our faith in God and His Beloved Son takes root The scriptures also enlarge our memory by helping us not forget what we and earlier generations have learned Those who either don t have or ignore the recorded word of God eventually cease to believe in Him and forget the purpose of their existence You will remember how important it was for Lehi s people to take the brass plates with them when they left Jerusalem These scriptures were key to their knowledge of God and the coming Redemption of Christ The other group that came out from Jerusalem shortly after Lehi had no scriptures and when Lehi s descendants encountered them some 300 or 400 years later it is recorded that their language had become corrupted and they denied the being of their Creator Omni 1 15 17 In Tyndale s day scriptural ignorance abounded because people lacked access to the Bible especially in a language they could understand Today the Bible and other scripture are readily at hand yet there is a growing scriptural illiteracy because people will not open the books Consequently they have forgotten things their grandparents knew The Scriptures Are the Standard for Distinguishing Truth and ErrorGod uses scripture to unmask erroneous thinking false traditions and sin with its devastating effects He is a tender parent who would spare us needless suffering and grief and at the same time help us realize our divine potential The scriptures for example discredit an ancient philosophy that has come back into vogue in our day the philosophy of Korihor that there are no absolute moral standards that every man prosper s according to his genius and that every man conquer s according to his strength and whatsoever a man does is no crime and that when a man is dead that is the end thereof Alma 30 17 18 Alma who had dealt with Korihor did not leave his own son Corianton in doubt about the reality and substance of a divine moral code Corianton had been guilty of sexual sin and his father spoke to him in love but plainly Know ye not my son that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord yea most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost Alma 39 5 In a complete reversal from a century ago many today would dispute with Alma about the seriousness of immorality Others would argue that it s all relative or that God s love is permissive If there is a God they say He excuses all sins and misdeeds because of His love for us there is no need for repentance Or at most a simple confession will do They have imagined a Jesus who wants people to work for social justice but who makes no demands upon their personal life and behavior 2 But a God of love does not leave us to learn by sad experience that wickedness never was happiness Alma 41 10 see also Helaman 13 38 His commandments are the voice of reality and our protection against self inflicted pain The scriptures are the touchstone for measuring correctness and truth and they are clear that real happiness lies not in denying the justice of God or trying to circumvent the consequences of sin but in repentance and forgiveness through the atoning grace of the Son of God see Alma 42 Scripture tutors us in principles and moral values essential to maintaining civil society including integrity responsibility selflessness fidelity and charity In scripture we find vivid portrayals of the blessings that come from honoring true principles as well as the tragedies that befall when individuals and civilizations discard them Where scriptural truths are ignored or abandoned the essential moral core of society disintegrates and decay is close behind In time nothing is left to sustain the institutions that sustain society The Scriptures Bring Us to Christ Our RedeemerIn the end the central purpose of all scripture is to fill our souls with faith in God the Father and in His Son Jesus Christ faith that They exist faith in the Father s plan for our immortality and eternal life faith in the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ which animates this plan of happiness faith to make the gospel of Jesus Christ our way of life and faith to come to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent John 17 3 The word of God as Alma said is like a seed planted in our hearts that produces faith as it begins to grow within us see Alma 32 27 43 see also Romans 10 13 17 Faith will not come from the study of ancient texts as a purely academic pursuit It will not come from archaeological digs and discoveries It will not come from scientific experiments It will not even come from witnessing miracles These things may serve to confirm faith or at times to challenge it but they do not create faith Faith comes by the witness of the Holy Spirit to our souls Spirit to spirit as we hear or read the word of God And faith matures as we continue to feast upon the word Scriptural accounts of the faith of others serve to strengthen our own We recall the faith of a centurion that enabled Christ to heal his servant without so much as seeing him see Matthew 8 5 13 and the healing of a Gentile woman s daughter because that humble mother would accept as it were even the crumbs from the Master s table see Matthew 15 22 28 Mark 7 25 30 We hear the cry of suffering Job Though he slay me yet will I trust in him Job 13 15 and professing I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and yet in my flesh shall I see God Job 19 25 26 We hear and take courage from the determination of a tender boy prophet hated and bitterly persecuted by so many adults I had seen a vision I knew it and I knew that God knew it and I could not deny it neither dared I do it Joseph Smith History 1 25 Because they expound the doctrine of Christ the scriptures are accompanied by the Holy Spirit whose role it is to bear witness of the Father and the Son see 3 Nephi 11 32 Therefore being in the scriptures is one way we receive the Holy Ghost Of course scripture is given through the Holy Ghost in the first place see 2 Peter 1 21 D C 20 26 27 68 4 and that same Spirit can attest its truth to you and me Study the scriptures carefully deliberately Ponder and pray over them Scriptures are revelation and they will bring added revelation Consider the magnitude of our blessing to have the Holy Bible and some 900 additional pages of scripture including the Book of Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price Then consider that in addition the words of prophets spoken as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost in settings such as this which the Lord calls scripture see D C 68 2 4 flow to us almost constantly by television radio Internet satellite CD DVD and in print I suppose that never in history has a people been blessed with such a quantity of holy writ And not only that but every man woman and child may possess and study his or her own personal copy of these sacred texts most in his or her own language How incredible such a thing would have seemed to the people of William Tyndale s day and to the Saints of earlier dispensations Surely with this blessing the Lord is telling us that our need for constant recourse to the scriptures is greater than in any previous time May we feast continuously on the words of Christ that will tell us all things we should do see 2 Nephi 32 3 I have studied the scriptures I have pondered the scriptures and on this Eastertide I bear you my testimony of the Father and the Son as They are revealed in the holy scriptures in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
During World War II President James E Faust then a young enlisted man in the United States Army applied for officer candidate school He appeared before a board of inquiry composed of what he described as hard bitten career soldier s After a while their questions turned to matters of religion The final questions were these In times of war should not the moral code be relaxed Does not the stress of battle justify men in doing things that they would not do when at home under normal situations President Faust relates I recognized that here was a chance perhaps to make some points and look broad minded I knew perfectly well that the men who were asking me this question did not live by the standards that I had been taught The thought flashed through my mind that perhaps I could say that I had my own beliefs but did not wish to impose them on others But there seemed to flash before my mind the faces of the many people to whom I had taught the law of chastity as a missionary In the end I simply said I do not believe there is a double standard of morality I left the hearing resigned to the fact that they would not like the answers I had given and would surely score me very low A few days later when the scores were posted to my astonishment I had passed I was in the first group taken for officer s candidate school This was one of the critical crossroads of my life 1President Faust recognized that we all possess the God given gift of moral agency the right to make choices and the obligation to account for those choices see D C 101 78 He also understood and demonstrated that for positive outcomes moral agency must be accompanied by moral discipline By moral discipline I mean self discipline based on moral standards Moral discipline is the consistent exercise of agency to choose the right because it is right even when it is hard It rejects the self absorbed life in favor of developing character worthy of respect and true greatness through Christlike service see Mark 10 42 45 The root of the word discipline is shared by the word disciple suggesting to the mind the fact that conformity to the example and teachings of Jesus Christ is the ideal discipline that coupled with His grace forms a virtuous and morally excellent person Jesus s own moral discipline was rooted in His discipleship to the Father To His disciples He explained My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work John 4 34 By this same pattern our moral discipline is rooted in loyalty and devotion to the Father and the Son It is the gospel of Jesus Christ that provides the moral certainty upon which moral discipline rests The societies in which many of us live have for more than a generation failed to foster moral discipline They have taught that truth is relative and that everyone decides for himself or herself what is right Concepts such as sin and wrong have been condemned as value judgments As the Lord describes it Every man walketh in his own way and after the image of his own god D C 1 16 As a consequence self discipline has eroded and societies are left to try to maintain order and civility by compulsion The lack of internal control by individuals breeds external control by governments One columnist observed that gentlemanly behavior for example once protected women from coarse behavior Today we expect sexual harassment laws to restrain coarse behavior Policemen and laws can never replace customs traditions and moral values as a means for regulating human behavior At best the police and criminal justice system are the last desperate line of defense for a civilized society Our increased reliance on laws to regulate behavior is a measure of how uncivilized we ve become 2In most of the world we have been experiencing an extended and devastating economic recession It was brought on by multiple causes but one of the major causes was widespread dishonest and unethical conduct particularly in the U S housing and financial markets Reactions have focused on enacting more and stronger regulation Perhaps that may dissuade some from unprincipled conduct but others will simply get more creative in their circumvention 3 There could never be enough rules so finely crafted as to anticipate and cover every situation and even if there were enforcement would be impossibly expensive and burdensome This approach leads to diminished freedom for everyone In the memorable phrase of Bishop Fulton J Sheen We would not accept the yoke of Christ so now we must tremble at the yoke of Caesar 4In the end it is only an internal moral compass in each individual that can effectively deal with the root causes as well as the symptoms of societal decay Societies will struggle in vain to establish the common good until sin is denounced as sin and moral discipline takes its place in the pantheon of civic virtues 5Moral discipline is learned at home While we cannot control what others may or may not do the Latter day Saints can certainly stand with those who demonstrate virtue in their own lives and inculcate virtue in the rising generation Remember from Book of Mormon history the young men who were key to the Nephite victory in the long war of 66 to 60 B C the sons of the people of Ammon Their character and discipline were described in these words They were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted Yea they were men of truth and soberness for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him Alma 53 20 21 Now they never had fought yet they did not fear death and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives yea they had been taught by their mothers that if they did not doubt God would deliver them Alma 56 47 Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken they are young and their minds are firm and they do put their trust in God continually Alma 57 27 Here we find a standard for what should happen in our homes and in the Church Our teaching should draw upon our own faith and focus first and foremost on instilling faith in God in the rising generation We must declare the essential need to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before Him in soberness or in other words with reverence Each must be persuaded that service and sacrifice for the well being and happiness of others are far superior to making one s own comfort and possessions the highest priority This requires more than an occasional reference to one or another gospel principle There must be constant teaching mostly by example President Henry B Eyring expressed the vision we strive to attain The pure gospel of Jesus Christ must go down into the hearts of our children by the power of the Holy Ghost It will not be enough for them to have had a spiritual witness of the truth and to want good things later It will not be enough for them to hope for some future cleansing and strengthening Our aim must be for them to become truly converted to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ while they are with us Then they will have gained a strength from what they are not only from what they know They will become disciples of Christ 6I have heard a few parents state that they don t want to impose the gospel on their children but want them to make up their own minds about what they will believe and follow They think that in this way they are allowing children to exercise their agency What they forget is that the intelligent use of agency requires knowledge of the truth of things as they really are see D C 93 24 Without that young people can hardly be expected to understand and evaluate the alternatives that come before them Parents should consider how the adversary approaches their children He and his followers are not promoting objectivity but are vigorous multimedia advocates of sin and selfishness Seeking to be neutral about the gospel is in reality to reject the existence of God and His authority We must rather acknowledge Him and His omniscience if we want our children to see life s choices clearly and be able to think for themselves They should not have to learn by sad experience that wickedness never was happiness Alma 41 10 I can share with you a simple example from my own life of what parents can do When I was about five or six years old I lived across the street from a small grocery store One day two other boys invited me to go with them to the store As we stood coveting the candy for sale there the older boy grabbed a candy bar and slipped it into his pocket He urged the other boy and me to do the same and after some hesitation we did Then we quickly left the store and ran off in separate directions I found a hiding place at home and tore off the candy wrapper My mother discovered me with the chocolate evidence smeared on my face and escorted me back to the grocery store As we crossed the street I was sure I was facing life imprisonment With sobs and tears I apologized to the owner and paid him for the candy bar with a dime that my mother had loaned me which I had to earn later My mother s love and discipline put an abrupt and early end to my life of crime All of us experience temptations So did the Savior but He gave no heed unto them D C 20 22 Similarly we do not have to yield simply because a temptation surfaces We may want to but we don t have to An incredulous female friend asked a young adult woman committed to living the law of chastity how it was possible that she had never slept with anybody Don t you want to the friend asked The young woman thought The question intrigued me because it was so utterly beside the point Mere wanting is hardly a proper guide for moral conduct 7In some cases temptation may have the added force of potential or actual addiction I am grateful that for an increasing number of people the Church can provide therapeutic help of various kinds to aid them in avoiding or coping with addictions Even so while therapy can support a person s will it cannot substitute for it Always and ever there must be an exercise of discipline moral discipline founded on faith in God the Father and the Son and what They can achieve with us through the atoning grace of Jesus Christ In Peter s words The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations 2 Peter 2 9 We cannot presume that the future will resemble the past that things and patterns we have relied upon economically politically socially will remain as they have been Perhaps our moral discipline if we will cultivate it will have an influence for good and inspire others to pursue the same course We may thereby have an impact on future trends and events At a minimum moral discipline will be of immense help to us as we deal with whatever stresses and challenges may come in a disintegrating society We have heard thoughtful and inspired messages during this conference and in a moment President Thomas S Monson will provide concluding words of counsel As we prayerfully consider what we have learned and relearned I believe that the Spirit will shed further light on those things that have particular application for each of us individually We will be fortified in the moral discipline needed to walk uprightly before the Lord and be at one with Him and the Father I stand with my brethren and with you my brothers and sisters as a witness that God is our Father and that His Son Jesus is our Redeemer Their law is immutable Their truth is everlasting and Their love is infinite In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
May I extend a warm and sincere welcome to Elder Neil L Andersen to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles He is a worthy and welcome addition On August 15 2007 Peru suffered a massive earthquake that all but destroyed the coastal cities of Pisco and Chincha Like many other Church leaders and members Wenceslao Conde the president of the Balconcito Branch of the Church in Chincha immediately set about helping others whose homes were damaged Four days after the earthquake Elder Marcus B Nash of the Seventy was in Chincha helping to coordinate the Church s relief efforts there and met President Conde As they talked about the destruction that had occurred and what was being done to help the victims President Conde s wife Pamela approached carrying one of her small children Elder Nash asked Sister Conde how her children were With a smile she replied that through the goodness of God they were all safe and well He asked about the Condes home It s gone she said simply What about your belongings he inquired Everything was buried in the rubble of our home Sister Conde replied And yet Elder Nash noted you are smiling as we talk Yes she said I have prayed and I am at peace We have all we need We have each other we have our children we are sealed in the temple we have this marvelous Church and we have the Lord We can build again with the Lord s help This tender demonstration of faith and spiritual strength is repeated in the lives of Saints across the world in many different settings It is a simple illustration of a profound power that is much needed in our day and that will become increasingly crucial in days ahead We need strong Christians who can persevere against hardship who can sustain hope through tragedy who can lift others by their example and their compassion and who can consistently overcome temptations We need strong Christians who can make important things happen by their faith and who can defend the truth of Jesus Christ against moral relativism and militant atheism What is the source of such moral and spiritual power and how do we obtain it The source is God Our access to that power is through our covenants with Him A covenant is an agreement between God and man an accord whose terms are set by God see Bible Dictionary Covenant 651 In these divine agreements God binds Himself to sustain sanctify and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments We enter into covenants by priesthood ordinances sacred rituals that God has ordained for us to manifest our commitment Our foundational covenant for example the one in which we first pledge our willingness to take upon us the name of Christ is confirmed by the ordinance of baptism It is done individually by name By this ordinance we become part of the covenant people of the Lord and heirs of the celestial kingdom of God Other sacred ordinances are performed in temples built for that very purpose If we are faithful to the covenants made there we become inheritors not only of the celestial kingdom but of exaltation the highest glory within the heavenly kingdom and we obtain all the divine possibilities God can give see D C 132 20 The scriptures speak of the new and everlasting covenant The new and everlasting covenant is the gospel of Jesus Christ In other words the doctrines and commandments of the gospel constitute the substance of an everlasting covenant between God and man that is newly restored in each dispensation If we were to state the new and everlasting covenant in one sentence it would be this For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life John 3 16 Jesus explained what it means to believe in Him Now this is the commandment or in other words this is the covenant Repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day 3 Nephi 27 20 What is it about making and keeping covenants with God that gives us the power to smile through hardships to convert tribulation into triumph to be anxiously engaged in a good cause and bring to pass much righteousness D C 58 27 Strengthened by Gifts and BlessingsFirst as we walk in obedience to the principles and commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ we enjoy a continual flow of blessings promised by God in His covenant with us Those blessings provide the resources we need to act rather than simply be acted upon as we go through life 1 For example the Lord s commandments in the Word of Wisdom regarding the care of our physical bodies bless us first and foremost with wisdom and great treasures of knowledge even hidden treasures D C 89 19 Furthermore they lead to a generally more healthy life and freedom from destructive addictions Obedience gives us greater control over our lives greater capacity to come and go to work and create Of course age accident and illnesses inevitably take their toll but even so our obedience to this gospel law enhances our capacity to deal with these challenges In the covenant path we find a steady supply of gifts and help Charity never faileth 1 Corinthians 13 8 Moroni 7 46 love begets love compassion begets compassion virtue begets virtue commitment begets loyalty and service begets joy We are part of a covenant people a community of Saints who encourage sustain and minister to one another As Nephi explained And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them and strengthen them 1 Nephi 17 3 2Strengthened with Increased FaithAll this is not to say that life in the covenant is free of challenge or that the obedient soul should be surprised if disappointments or even disasters interrupt his peace If you feel that personal righteousness should preclude all loss and suffering you might want to have a chat with Job This brings us to a second way in which our covenants supply strength they produce the faith necessary to persevere and to do all things that are expedient in the Lord Our willingness to take upon us the name of Christ and keep His commandments requires a degree of faith but as we honor our covenants that faith expands In the first place the promised fruits of obedience become evident which confirms our faith Secondly the Spirit communicates God s pleasure and we feel secure in His continued blessing and help Thirdly come what may we can face life with hope and equanimity knowing that we will succeed in the end because we have God s promise to us individually by name and we know He cannot lie see Enos 1 6 Ether 3 12 Early Church leaders in this dispensation confirmed that adhering to the covenant path provides the reassurance we need in times of trial It was the knowledge that their course in life conformed to the will of God that enabled the ancient saints to endure all their afflictions and persecutions and to take not only the spoiling of their goods and the wasting of their substance joyfully but also to suffer death in its most horrid forms knowing not merely believing that when this earthly house of their tabernacle was dissolved they had a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens 2 Cor 5 1 Lectures on Faith 1985 67 They further pointed out that in offering whatever sacrifice God may require of us we obtain the witness of the Spirit that our course is right and pleasing to God see Lectures on Faith 69 71 With that knowledge our faith becomes unbounded having the assurance that God will in due time turn every affliction to our gain Some of you have been sustained by that faith as you have endured those who point fingers of scorn from the great and spacious building and cry Shame see 1 Nephi 8 26 27 and you have stood firm with Peter and the Apostles of old rejoicing that you were counted worthy to suffer shame for Christ s name Acts 5 41 The Lord said of the Church Verily I say unto you all among them who are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice yea every sacrifice which I the Lord shall command they are accepted of me For I the Lord will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land by a pure stream that yieldeth much precious fruit D C 97 8 9 The Apostle Paul understood that one who has entered into a covenant with God is both given the faith to face trials and gains even greater faith through those trials Of his personal thorn in the flesh 2 Corinthians 12 7 he observed For this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me And he said unto me My grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me Therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ s sake for when I am weak then am I strong 2 Corinthians 12 8 10 3Strengthened through the Power of Godliness We have considered first the empowering blessings and second the endowment of faith that God grants to those who keep their covenants with Him A final aspect of strength through covenants that I will mention is the bestowal of divine power Our covenant commitment to Him permits our Heavenly Father to let His divine influence the power of godliness D C 84 20 flow into our lives He can do that because by our participation in priesthood ordinances we exercise our agency and elect to receive it Our participation in those ordinances also demonstrates that we are prepared to accept the additional responsibility that comes with added light and spiritual power In all the ordinances especially those of the temple we are endowed with power from on high 4 This power of godliness comes in the person and by the influence of the Holy Ghost The gift of the Holy Ghost is part of the new and everlasting covenant It is an essential part of our baptism the baptism of the Spirit It is the messenger of grace by which the blood of Christ is applied to take away our sins and sanctify us see 2 Nephi 31 17 It is the gift by which Adam was quickened in the inner man Moses 6 65 It was by the Holy Ghost that the ancient Apostles endured all that they endured and by their priesthood keys carried the gospel to the known world of their day When we have entered into divine covenants the Holy Ghost is our comforter our guide and our companion The fruits of the Holy Spirit are the peaceable things of immortal glory the truth of all things that which quickeneth all things which maketh alive all things that which knoweth all things and hath all power according to wisdom mercy truth justice and judgment Moses 6 61 The gifts of the Holy Spirit are testimony faith knowledge wisdom revelations miracles healing and charity to name but a few see D C 46 13 26 It is the Holy Ghost that bears witness of your words when you teach and testify It is the Holy Ghost that as you speak in hostile venues puts into your heart what you should say and fulfills the Lord s promise that you shall not be confounded before men D C 100 5 It is the Holy Ghost that reveals how you may clear the next seemingly insurmountable hurdle It is by the Holy Ghost in you that others may feel the pure love of Christ and receive strength to press forward It is also the Holy Ghost in His character as the Holy Spirit of Promise that confirms the validity and efficacy of your covenants and seals God s promises upon you 5Divine covenants make strong Christians I urge each one to qualify for and receive all the priesthood ordinances you can and then faithfully keep the promises you have made by covenant In times of distress let your covenants be paramount and let your obedience be exact Then you can ask in faith nothing wavering according to your need and God will answer He will sustain you as you work and watch In His own time and way He will stretch forth his hand to you saying Here am I I testify that in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is found the priesthood authority to administer the ordinances by which we can enter into binding covenants with our Heavenly Father in the name of His Holy Son I testify that God will keep His promises to you as you honor your covenants with Him He will bless you in good measure pressed down shaken together and running over Luke 6 38 He will strengthen and finish your faith He will by His Holy Spirit fill you with godly power I pray that you will always have His Spirit to be with you to guide you and deliver you from want anxiety and distress I pray that through your covenants you may become a powerful instrument for good in the hands of Him who is our Lord and Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Prophet Joseph Smith said The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age it is a theme upon which prophets priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day but they died without the sight we are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter day glory Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith Melchizedek Priesthood and Relief Society course of study 2007 186 Zion is both a place and a people Zion was the name given to the ancient city of Enoch in the days before the Flood And it came to pass in his days that he built a city that was called the City of Holiness even Zion Moses 7 19 This Zion endured for some 365 years see Moses 7 68 The scriptural record states And Enoch and all his people walked with God and he dwelt in the midst of Zion and it came to pass that Zion was not for God received it up into his own bosom and from thence went forth the saying Zion is fled Moses 7 69 Later Jerusalem and its temple were called Mount Zion and the scriptures prophesy of a future New Jerusalem where Christ shall reign as King of Zion when for the space of a thousand years the earth shall rest Moses 7 53 64 The Lord called Enoch s people Zion because they were of one heart and one mind and dwelt in righteousness and there was no poor among them Moses 7 18 Elsewhere He said For this is Zion the pure in heart D C 97 21 The antithesis and antagonist of Zion is Babylon The city of Babylon was originally Babel of Tower of Babel fame and later became the capital of the Babylonian empire Its principal edifice was the temple of Bel or Baal the idol referred to by Old Testament prophets as The Shame given the sexual perversions that were associated with its worship See Bible Dictionary Assyria and Babylonia 615 16 Baal 617 18 Babylon or Babel 618 Its worldliness its worship of evil and the captivity of Judah there following the conquest of 587 B C all combine to make Babylon the symbol of decadent societies and spiritual bondage It is with this backdrop that the Lord said to the members of His Church Go ye out of Babylon gather ye out from among the nations from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other D C 133 7 He called for the elders of His Church to be sent forth across the world to accomplish this gathering commencing an effort that continues in full vigor today And behold and lo this shall be their cry and the voice of the Lord unto all people Go ye forth unto the land of Zion that the borders of my people may be enlarged and that her stakes may be strengthened and that Zion may go forth unto the regions round about D C 133 9 And so today the Lord s people are gathering out from among the nations as they gather into the congregations and stakes of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints that are scattered throughout the nations Nephi foresaw that these dominions would be small but that the Lord s power would descend upon the saints of the church of the Lamb who were scattered upon all the face of the earth and they would be armed with righteousness see 1 Nephi 14 12 14 The Lord calls upon us to be beacons of righteousness to guide those who seek the safety and blessings of Zion Verily I say unto you all Arise and shine forth that thy light may be a standard for the nations And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion and upon her stakes may be for a defense and for a refuge from the storm and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth D C 115 5 6 Under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith early members of the Church attempted to establish the center place of Zion in Missouri but they did not qualify to build the holy city The Lord explained one of the reasons for their failure They have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at their hands but are full of all manner of evil and do not impart of their substance as becometh saints to the poor and afflicted among them And are not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom D C 105 3 4 There were jarrings and contentions and envyings and strifes and lustful and covetous desires among them therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances D C 101 6 Rather than judge these early Saints too harshly however we should look to ourselves to see if we are doing any better Zion is Zion because of the character attributes and faithfulness of her citizens Remember the Lord called his people Zion because they were of one heart and one mind and dwelt in righteousness and there was no poor among them Moses 7 18 If we would establish Zion in our homes branches wards and stakes we must rise to this standard It will be necessary 1 to become unified in one heart and one mind 2 to become individually and collectively a holy people and 3 to care for the poor and needy with such effectiveness that we eliminate poverty among us We cannot wait until Zion comes for these things to happen Zion will come only as they happen UnityAs we consider the unity required for Zion to flourish we should ask ourselves if we have overcome jarrings contentions envyings and strifes see D C 101 6 Are we individually and as a people free from strife and contention and united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom D C 105 4 Forgiveness of one another is essential to this unity Jesus said I the Lord will forgive whom I will forgive but of you it is required to forgive all men D C 64 10 We will become of one heart and one mind as we individually place the Savior at the center of our lives and follow those He has commissioned to lead us We can unite with President Thomas S Monson in love and concern for one another In general conference last April President Monson spoke to those estranged from the Church and to all of us when he said In the private sanctuary of one s own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential In this spirit we again issue that heartfelt invitation Come back We reach out to you in the pure love of Christ and express our desire to assist you and to welcome you into full fellowship To those who are wounded in spirit or who are struggling and fearful we say Let us lift you and cheer you and calm your fears Looking Back and Moving Forward Liahona and Ensign May 2008 90 At the end of July this year young single adults from several countries in eastern Europe gathered outside Budapest Hungary for a conference Among this group were 20 young men and women from Moldova who had spent days obtaining passports and visas and over 30 hours traveling by bus to get there The conference program included some 15 workshops Each person needed to select the two or three that he or she most wanted to attend Rather than focus exclusively on their own interests these Moldovan young adults got together and made plans so that at least one of their group would be in each class and take copious notes Then they would share what they had learned with each other and later with the young adults in Moldova who could not attend In its simplest form this exemplifies the unity and love for one another that multiplied thousands of times in different ways will bring again Zion Isaiah 52 8 HolinessMuch of the work to be done in establishing Zion consists in our individual efforts to become the pure in heart D C 97 21 Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom said the Lord otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself D C 105 5 The law of the celestial kingdom is of course the gospel law and covenants which include our constant remembrance of the Savior and our pledge of obedience sacrifice consecration and fidelity The Savior was critical of some of the early Saints for their lustful desires D C 101 6 see also D C 88 121 These were people who lived in a non television non film non Internet non iPod world In a world now awash in sexualized images and music are we free from lustful desires and their attendant evils Far from pushing the limits of modest dress or indulging in the vicarious immorality of pornography we are to hunger and thirst after righteousness To come to Zion it is not enough for you or me to be somewhat less wicked than others We are to become not only good but holy men and women Recalling Elder Neal A Maxwell s phrase let us once and for all establish our residence in Zion and give up the summer cottage in Babylon see Neal A Maxwell A Wonderful Flood of Light 1990 47 Caring for the PoorThroughout history the Lord has measured societies and individuals by how well they cared for the poor He has said For the earth is full and there is enough and to spare yea I prepared all things and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves Therefore if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made and impart not his portion according to the law of my gospel unto the poor and the needy he shall with the wicked lift up his eyes in hell being in torment D C 104 17 18 see also D C 56 16 17 Furthermore He declares In your temporal things you shall be equal and this not grudgingly otherwise the abundance of the manifestations of the Spirit shall be withheld D C 70 14 see also D C 49 20 78 5 7 We control the disposition of our means and resources but we account to God for this stewardship over earthly things It is gratifying to witness your generosity as you contribute to fast offerings and humanitarian projects Over the years the suffering of millions has been alleviated and countless others have been enabled to help themselves through the generosity of the Saints Nevertheless as we pursue the cause of Zion each of us should prayerfully consider whether we are doing what we should and all that we should in the Lord s eyes with respect to the poor and the needy We might ask ourselves living as many of us do in societies that worship possessions and pleasures whether we are remaining aloof from covetousness and the lust to acquire more and more of this world s goods Materialism is just one more manifestation of the idolatry and pride that characterize Babylon Perhaps we can learn to be content with what is sufficient for our needs The Apostle Paul warned Timothy against people who suppose that gain is godliness 1 Timothy 6 5 Said he We brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out And having food and raiment let us be therewith content 1 Timothy 6 7 8 In much of the world we are entering upon unsettled economic times Let us look after one another the very best we can I remember the story of a Vietnamese family that fled Saigon in 1975 and ended up living in a small mobile home in Provo Utah A young man in the refugee family became the home teaching companion to a Brother Johnson who lived nearby with his large family The boy related the following One day Brother Johnson noticed that our family had no kitchen table He appeared the next day with an odd looking but very functional table that fit nicely against the trailer wall across from the kitchen sink and counters I say odd looking because two of the table legs matched the tabletop and two did not Also several small wooden pegs stuck out along one edge of the worn surface Soon we used this unique table daily for food preparation and for eating some quick meals We still ate our family meals while we sat on the floor in true Vietnamese fashion One evening I stood inside Brother Johnson s front door as I waited for him before a home teaching appointment There in the nearby kitchen I was surprised to see it was a table practically identical to the one they had given to my family The only difference was that where our table had pegs the Johnsons table had holes I then realized that seeing our need this charitable man had cut his kitchen table in half and had built two new legs for each half It was obvious that the Johnson family could not fit around this small piece of furniture they probably didn t fit comfortably around it when it was whole Throughout my life this kind act has been a powerful reminder of true giving Son Quang Le as told to Beth Ellis Le Two of a Kind Table Liahona July 2004 45 Ensign July 2004 63 The Prophet Joseph Smith said We ought to have the building up of Zion as our greatest object Teachings Joseph Smith 186 In our families and in our stakes and districts let us seek to build up Zion through unity godliness and charity preparing for that great day when Zion the New Jerusalem will arise In the words of our hymn Israel Israel God is calling Calling thee from lands of woe Babylon the great is falling God shall all her tow rs o erthrow Come to Zion come to Zion And within her walls rejoice Come to Zion come to Zion For your coming Lord is nigh Israel Israel God Is Calling Hymns no 7 I bear witness of Jesus Christ the King of Zion in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Fifteen years ago I stood for the first time at the pulpit in the Tabernacle as a newly sustained Seventy I was 48 years old I had thick dark brown hair I thought I understood what it meant to feel inadequate At the end of my five minute remarks my shirt was dripping with perspiration The whole thing was something of an ordeal However today in retrospect it seems a comparatively pleasant experience When President Dieter F Uchtdorf and Elder David A Bednar were first sustained as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles a witness of the divine origin of their calls came to me during the session I was also given in that moment an understanding of the surpassing sacredness of the call and service of an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I do not have the words to express that understanding because it was communicated Spirit to spirit without words To think of it now reduces me to a depth of humility I have never before experienced and I plead with my Heavenly Father to sustain me as He ever has that I might measure up to something that is far beyond my native capacity and be able to focus outwardly losing myself in your service I trust in Him and I know that His grace is sufficient and so I here unreservedly commit all that I have and am to God and His Beloved Son I also commit myself my loyalty my service and my love to the First Presidency and to my Brethren of the Twelve My patriarchal blessing received at age 13 from a beloved grandfather includes this statement Your Heavenly Father sent you forth in this last and glorious dispensation that you might be born under the new and everlasting covenant by goodly righteous parents With deepest appreciation I acknowledge that this has been the great foundational blessing of my life I pay tribute to my parents and with love acknowledge my debt to them and to their parents and generations beyond Not long after my call to the Seventy I had occasion to be standing at the grave of one of those ancestors who had died years before I was born As I contemplated the sacrifices entailed upon him and his family by their acceptance of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ a sense of gratitude flooded my heart and a resolve welled up in me to honor his sacrifice and that of those who came after by being faithful to God and the gospel covenants as they were In acknowledging blessings I include my dear brothers and their spouses who as it happens are present today My wife and I have four sons and a daughter each married to a wonderful spouse or in the case of our youngest son soon to be married to a lovely young woman We love them and our grandchildren and appreciate how they bless our lives by their loyalty to the Savior and His gospel At the pinnacle is my wife Kathy the maker of our home the light of my life a steady and wise companion filled with spiritual intuition good humor goodwill and charity I love her beyond expression and hope to show it more convincingly in the days and years ahead It was my blessing to serve a full time mission as a young man in Argentina under the tutelage of two exceptional mission presidents Ronald V Stone and Richard G Scott and their respective wives Patricia and Jeanene I thank God for their lasting influence in me Following my graduation from law school Kathy and I and our children made our homes successively in the states of Maryland Tennessee Virginia North Carolina and now Utah Three precious years were spent in Mexico In all of these places we have been blessed with dear friends in and out of the Church who have loved and taught and befriended us and our children and who continue to do so I take this opportunity to publicly express gratitude to all of them My love and regard for my Brethren of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric is boundless I rejoice that my continuing service will keep me close to them and that there will be frequent opportunities to serve together The unfolding revelations of our time that have set the Seventy in place in the Church constitute one of the most profound and perhaps underappreciated miracles in the history of the Lord s latter day work The Seventy are key to the success of the work now and in the years ahead and I feel honored beyond measure that my name was ever included among theirs God bless you my Brethren I wish to bear you my witness of Jesus Christ the Son of God and the power of His infinite atoning sacrifice In doing so I will call upon an experience from my years in Tennessee One evening there I received a call at home from a gentleman I did not know He introduced himself as a recently retired minister of another faith and asked to meet with me privately the following Sunday When we met my guest stated frankly he had come out of concern for the welfare of my soul He pulled out of his portfolio a fairly long list of scripture citations from the New Testament and said he wanted to review these verses with me and see if he could help me be saved I was a bit surprised at his directness but I could tell that he was sincere and I was touched by his genuine interest in me We conversed for more than an hour and he was open to hear me explain something of my faith as well as to read with me some teachings from the Book of Mormon with which he was not familiar We found there was much we believed in common and some things we did not We felt a bond of friendship and prayed together before he left What remains with me is our discussion about being born again It is spiritual rebirth through Jesus Christ that is the context of my witness of Him It was Jesus who stated that entry into the kingdom of God requires that one be born again born of water and of the Spirit see John 3 3 5 His teaching about a physical and a spiritual baptism helps us understand that both our own action and the intervention of divine power are needed for this transformative rebirth for the change from natural man to saint see Mosiah 3 19 Paul described being born again with this simple expression Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature 2 Corinthians 5 17 Consider two examples from the Book of Mormon About a century before the birth of Christ King Benjamin taught his people of the Savior s advent and Atonement The Spirit of the Lord wrought such a mighty change in the people that they had no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually Mosiah 5 2 Because of their faith in Christ they said We are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will and to be obedient to his commandments all the remainder of our days Mosiah 5 5 emphasis added The king responded Because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ his sons and his daughters for behold this day he hath spiritually begotten you for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name Mosiah 5 7 see also D C 76 24 The case of Alma is also instructive As he and his companions went about seeking to destroy the Church of Christ they were rebuked by an angel There followed for Alma three days and nights that he described as being racked with eternal torment Yea I did remember all my sins and iniquities for which I was tormented with the pains of hell Alma 36 12 13 Finally after repenting nigh unto death Mosiah 27 28 as he put it there came to his mind the sweet message of Jesus Christ and His Atonement Alma pled O Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me who am in the gall of bitterness and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death Alma 36 18 Forgiveness came to him and he stood and publicly confessed I have repented of my sins and have been redeemed of the Lord behold I am born of the Spirit And the Lord said unto me Marvel not that all mankind yea men and women all nations kindreds tongues and people must be born again yea born of God changed from their carnal and fallen state to a state of righteousness being redeemed of God becoming his sons and daughters And thus they become new creatures Mosiah 27 24 26 As we reflect on these examples and other scriptures it becomes clear that spiritual rebirth originates with faith in Jesus Christ by whose grace we are changed More specifically it is faith in Christ as the Atoning One the Redeemer who can cleanse from sin and make holy see Mosiah 4 2 3 When this true faith takes root in a person it inevitably leads to repentance Amulek taught that the Savior s sacrifice would bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name this being the intent of this last sacrifice to bring about the bowels of mercy which overpowereth justice and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance Alma 34 15 emphasis added To be complete however repentance requires a covenant of obedience This is the covenant expressed by Benjamin s people to do God s will and to be obedient to his commandments Mosiah 5 5 This is the covenant witnessed by baptism in water see Mosiah 18 10 sometimes referred to in the scriptures as the baptism of repentance or baptism unto repentance inasmuch as it is the culminating step the capstone of our repentance see for example Acts 19 4 Alma 7 14 9 27 D C 107 20 Then as promised the Lord baptizes us with fire and with the Holy Ghost 3 Nephi 9 20 Nephi phrased it this way For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost 2 Nephi 31 17 1 Having thus relied upon the merits of him who is mighty to save 2 Nephi 31 19 we are quickened in the inner man Moses 6 65 and if not yet fully born again then certainly well into the path of spiritual rebirth Now the Lord cautions us to take heed since there is a possibility that man may fall from grace D C 20 32 even those who are sanctified see vv 32 34 As Nephi counseled Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men Wherefore if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life 2 Nephi 31 20 You may ask Why doesn t this mighty change happen more quickly with me You should remember that the remarkable examples of King Benjamin s people Alma and some others in scripture are just that remarkable and not typical 2 For most of us the changes are more gradual and occur over time Being born again unlike our physical birth is more a process than an event And engaging in that process is the central purpose of mortality At the same time let us not justify ourselves in a casual effort Let us not be content to retain some disposition to do evil Let us worthily partake of the sacrament each week and continue to draw upon the Holy Spirit to root out the last vestiges of impurity within us I testify that as you continue in the path of spiritual rebirth the atoning grace of Jesus Christ will take away your sins and the stain of those sins in you temptations will lose their appeal and through Christ you will become holy as He and our Father are holy I know Jesus Christ as the living resurrected Son of God I know that justification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true And I know also that sanctification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true to all those who love and serve God with all their mights minds and strength D C 20 30 31 see also Moroni 10 32 33 I rejoice that for the balance of my life I shall be able continually to offer Christ to offer the good news of Christ in all the world I bear witness of the reality and love of God our Heavenly Father to whom Jesus gave all glory I love and bear witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith Through his personal association with the Lord his translation and publication of the Book of Mormon and the sealing of his testimony with his martyr s blood Joseph has become the preeminent revelator of Jesus Christ in His true character as divine Redeemer Jesus has had no greater witness nor more devoted friend than Joseph Smith I declare my testimony of the calling of President Thomas S Monson as prophet and President of the Church of Jesus Christ in this time and pledge my loyalty to him and his counselors in their sacred roles I pray God s blessings upon us all In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Years ago when my brothers and I were boys our mother had radical cancer surgery She came very close to death Much of the tissue in her neck and shoulder had to be removed and for a long time it was very painful for her to use her right arm One morning about a year after the surgery my father took Mother to an appliance store and asked the manager to show her how to use a machine he had for ironing clothes The machine was called an Ironrite It was operated from a chair by pressing pedals with one s knees to lower a padded roller against a heated metal surface and turn the roller feeding in shirts pants dresses and other articles You can see that this would make ironing of which there was a great deal in our family of five boys much easier especially for a woman with limited use of her arm Mother was shocked when Dad told the manager they would buy the machine and then paid cash for it Despite my father s good income as a veterinarian Mother s surgery and medications had left them in a difficult financial situation On the way home my mother was upset How can we afford it Where did the money come from How will we get along now Finally Dad told her that he had gone without lunches for nearly a year to save enough money Now when you iron he said you won t have to stop and go into the bedroom and cry until the pain in your arm stops She didn t know he knew about that I was not aware of my father s sacrifice and act of love for my mother at the time but now that I know I say to myself There is a man The prophet Lehi pled with his rebellious sons saying Arise from the dust my sons and be men 2 Nephi 1 21 emphasis added By age Laman and Lemuel were men but in terms of character and spiritual maturity they were still as children They murmured and complained if asked to do anything hard They didn t accept anyone s authority to correct them They didn t value spiritual things They easily resorted to violence and they were good at playing the victim We see some of the same attitudes today Some act as if a man s highest goal should be his own pleasure Permissive social mores have let men off the hook as it were so that many think it acceptable to father children out of wedlock and to cohabit rather than marry 1 Dodging commitments is considered smart but sacrificing for the good of others naive For some a life of work and achievement is optional A psychologist studying the growing phenomenon of what he calls young men stuck in neutral describes this scenario Justin goes off to college for a year or two wastes thousands of dollars of his parents money then gets bored and comes home to take up residence in his old room the same bedroom where he lived when he was in high school Now he s working 16 hours a week at Kinko s or part time at Starbucks His parents are pulling their hair out Justin you re 26 years old You re not in school You don t have a career You don t even have a girlfriend What s the plan When are you going to get a life What s the problem Justin asks I haven t gotten arrested for anything I haven t asked you guys for money Why can t you just chill 2How s that for ambition We who hold the priesthood of God cannot afford to drift We have work to do see Moroni 9 6 We must arise from the dust of self indulgence and be men It is a wonderful aspiration for a boy to become a man strong and capable someone who can build and create things run things someone who makes a difference in the world It is a wonderful aspiration for those of us who are older to make the vision of true manhood a reality in our lives and be models for those who look to us for an example In large measure true manhood is defined in our relationship to women The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have given us the ideal to pursue in these words The family is ordained of God Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity By divine design fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families 3Over the years I have visited members of the Church in many countries and despite differences in circumstances and cultures everywhere I have been impressed with the faith and capacity of our women including some of the very young So many of them possess a remarkable faith and goodness They know the scriptures They are poised and confident I ask myself Do we have men to match these women Are our young men developing into worthy companions that such women can look up to and respect President Gordon B Hinckley speaking in this meeting in April 1998 gave specific counsel for young men The girl you marry will take a terrible chance on you You will largely determine the remainder of her life Work for an education Get all the training that you can The world will largely pay you what it thinks you are worth Paul did not mince words when he wrote to Timothy But if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel 1 Tim 5 8 4Integrity is fundamental to being men Integrity means being truthful but it also means accepting responsibility and honoring commitments and covenants President N Eldon Tanner a former counselor in the First Presidency and a man of integrity told of someone who sought his advice A young man came to me not long ago and said I made an agreement with a man that requires me to make certain payments each year I am in arrears and I can t make those payments for if I do it is going to cause me to lose my home What shall I do I looked at him and said Keep your agreement Even if it costs me my home I said I am not talking about your home I am talking about your agreement and I think your wife would rather have a husband who would keep his word meet his obligations and have to rent a home than to have a home with a husband who will not keep his covenants and his pledges 5Good men sometimes make mistakes A man of integrity will honestly face and correct his mistakes and that is an example we can respect Sometimes men try but fail Not all worthy objectives are realized despite one s honest and best efforts True manhood is not always measured by the fruits of one s labors but by the labors themselves by one s striving 6Though he will make some sacrifices and deny himself some pleasures in the course of honoring his commitments the true man leads a rewarding life He gives much but he receives more and he lives content in the approval of his Heavenly Father The life of true manhood is the good life Most importantly when we consider the admonition to be men we must think of Jesus Christ When Pilate brought Jesus forth wearing a crown of thorns he declared Behold the man see John 19 4 5 Pilate may not have fully understood the significance of his own words but the Lord indeed stood before the people then as He stands today the highest ideal of manhood Behold the man The Lord asked His disciples what manner of men they should be and then answered Verily I say unto you even as I am 3 Nephi 27 27 see also 3 Nephi 18 24 That is our ultimate quest What did He do that we can emulate as men Jesus rejected temptation When confronted by the great tempter himself Jesus yielded not to the temptation Mosiah 15 5 He countered with scripture Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Matthew 4 4 Gospel commandments and standards are our protection also and like the Savior we may draw strength from the scriptures to resist temptation The Savior was obedient He forsook completely the natural man Mosiah 3 19 and yielded His will to the Father see Mosiah 15 7 He was baptized to show that according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments 2 Nephi 31 7 Jesus went about doing good Acts 10 38 He employed the divine powers of the holy priesthood to bless those in need such as healing the sick raising the dead causing the lame to walk the blind to receive their sight and the deaf to hear and curing all manner of diseases Mosiah 3 5 Jesus told His Apostles Whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many Mark 10 44 45 As His fellow servants we may become great in His kingdom through love and service The Savior was fearless in opposing evil and error Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and said unto them It is written My house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves Matthew 21 12 13 He called upon all to repent see Matthew 4 17 and be forgiven see John 8 11 Alma 5 33 So might we stand firm in defending sacred things and in raising the warning voice He gave His life to redeem mankind Surely we can accept responsibility for those He entrusts to our care Brethren let us be men even as He is In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My comments are directed particularly to young people although I hope they may be helpful to everyone Years ago when I served as a stake president a man came to confess a transgression His confession surprised me He had been an active member of the Church for years I wondered how a person with his experience could have committed the sin that he did After some pondering it came to me that this brother had never become truly converted Despite his Church activity the gospel had not penetrated his heart It was only an external influence in his life When he was in wholesome environments he kept the commandments but in a different environment other influences might control his actions How can you become converted How can you make the gospel of Jesus Christ not just an influence in your life but the controlling influence and indeed the very core of what you are The ancient prophet Jeremiah spoke of the law of God the gospel being written in our hearts He quotes the Lord speaking about us His people in the latter days I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people 1Do you want this for yourself I can tell you how that can happen but it must be something you want The gospel cannot be written in your heart unless your heart is open Without a heartfelt desire you can participate in sacrament meetings classes and Church activities and do the things I will tell you but it won t make much difference But if your heart is open and willing like the heart of a child 2 let me tell you what you can do to be converted As a first step you must lay aside any feeling of pride that is so common in the world today By this I mean the attitude that rejects the authority of God to rule in our lives This attitude was described by the Lord to Joseph Smith when He said They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness but every man walketh in his own way and after the image of his own god 3 You hear it expressed today in phrases such as Do your own thing or Right and wrong depend on what I feel is right for me That attitude is a rebellion against God just as Lucifer rebelled against God in the premortal world He rejected God s right to declare the truth and establish the law 4 Satan wanted and still wants the power to declare arbitrarily what is right and wrong Our beloved Creator does not force us to accept His authority but willingly submitting to that authority is the first step in conversion Further for the gospel to be written in your heart you need to know what it is and grow to understand it more fully That means you will study it 5 When I say study I mean something more than reading It is a good thing sometimes to read a book of scripture within a set period of time to get an overall sense of its message but for conversion you should care more about the amount of time you spend in the scriptures than about the amount you read in that time I see you sometimes reading a few verses stopping to ponder them carefully reading the verses again and as you think about what they mean praying for understanding asking questions in your mind waiting for spiritual impressions and writing down the impressions and insights that come so you can remember and learn more Studying in this way you may not read a lot of chapters or verses in a half hour but you will be giving place in your heart for the word of God and He will be speaking to you Remember Alma s description of what it feels like It beginneth to enlarge my soul yea it beginneth to enlighten my understanding yea it beginneth to be delicious to me 6 You will know that the gospel is being written in your heart that your conversion is happening as the word of the Lord from His prophets past and present feels more and more delicious to your soul I mentioned praying as you study to understand the scriptures but your prayers must not be limited to that In the Book of Mormon Amulek tells us we should pray about everything in our lives He says Pour out your souls to God in your closets and your secret places and in your wilderness 7 Your Heavenly Father wants you to pray about your hopes and fears your friends and family your school and work and the needs of those around you Most of all you should pray to be filled with the love of Christ This love is given to those who are true followers of Jesus Christ who ask for it with all the energy of their heart 8 This love is the fruit of the tree of life 9 and tasting it is a major part of your conversion because once you have felt your Savior s love for you even the smallest part you will feel secure and a love for Him and for your Heavenly Father will grow within you In your heart you will want to do what these holy beings ask of you Go often to your closet your secret place your wilderness Thank God for your blessings ask for His help ask Him to bestow upon you the pure love of Christ Sometimes fasting will help After Amulek talked about prayer he spoke about something else that is an important element of your conversion serving others Otherwise he said your prayer is vain and availeth you nothing 10 In other words to be converted you must not only open your heart to a knowledge of the gospel and the love of God you must practice the gospel law You cannot fully understand or appreciate it unless you personally apply it in your life Jesus said that He came to serve not to be served 11 So it must be with you You must look outward and care about others You can be compassionate you can be friendly you can share you can help others in a hundred small ways As you do the gospel of Jesus Christ will become a part of you Let me mention one other thing In ancient times when people wanted to worship the Lord and seek His blessings they often brought a gift For example when they went to the temple they brought a sacrifice to place on the altar After His Atonement and Resurrection the Savior said He would no longer accept burnt offerings of animals The gift or sacrifice He will accept now is a broken heart and a contrite spirit 12 As you seek the blessing of conversion you can offer the Lord the gift of your broken or repentant heart and your contrite or obedient spirit In reality it is the gift of yourself what you are and what you are becoming Is there something in you or in your life that is impure or unworthy When you get rid of it that is a gift to the Savior Is there a good habit or quality that is lacking in your life When you adopt it and make it part of your character you are giving a gift to the Lord 13 Sometimes this is hard to do but would your gifts of repentance and obedience be worthy gifts if they cost you nothing 14 Don t be afraid of the effort required And remember you don t have to do it alone Jesus Christ will help you make of yourself a worthy gift His grace will make you clean even holy Eventually you will become like Him perfect in Christ 15With conversion you will wear a protective armor the whole armour of God 16 and the words of Christ which come by the Holy Spirit will tell you all things you should do 17In 1992 two sister missionaries in Zagreb Croatia were returning to their apartment one evening Their last teaching appointment had been some distance away and it was getting dark Several men on the trolley made crude comments and became rather menacing Feeling threatened the sisters got off the trolley at the next stop just as the doors closed so no one could follow them Having avoided that problem they realized they were in a place unknown to either of them As they turned to look for help they saw a woman The missionaries explained that they were lost and asked the woman if she could direct them She knew where they could find another trolley to take them home and invited them to follow her On the way they had to pass a bar with patrons sitting along the sidewalk in the gathering darkness These men also appeared threatening Nevertheless the two young women had the distinct impression that the men could not see them They walked by apparently invisible to those who might have had a mind to harm them When the sisters and their guide reached the stop the trolley they needed was just arriving They turned to thank the woman but she was nowhere to be seen 18These missionaries were furnished a guide and other blessings to protect them physically As you become converted you will have comparable protections to keep you from temptation and deliver you from evil 19 Sometimes evil will not find you Sometimes you will be protected when evil is made invisible to you Even when you must confront it directly you will do so with faith not fear We have talked of desire submissiveness to God study prayer service repentance and obedience From these coupled with your worship and activity in Church will come testimony and conversion The gospel won t be just an influence in your life it will be what you are Plead with God in the name of Christ to write the gospel in your mind that you may have understanding and in your heart that you may love to do His will 20 Pursue this blessing diligently and patiently and you will receive it for God is gracious and merciful and of great kindness 21 I so bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As His mortal ministry drew to a close knowing that his hour was come John 13 1 Jesus gathered His Apostles in an upper room in Jerusalem Following their supper and after He had washed their feet and taught them Jesus offered a sublime Intercessory Prayer on behalf of these Apostles and all who would believe in Him He supplicated the Father in these words Neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word That they all may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one John 17 20 23 How glorious it is to contemplate that we have been invited into that perfect unity that exists with the Father and the Son How can this happen Pondering this question it becomes clear that we must begin by becoming one within ourselves We are dual beings of flesh and spirit and we sometimes feel out of harmony or in conflict Our spirit is enlightened by conscience the light of Christ see Moro 7 16 D C 93 2 and naturally responds to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit and desires to follow truth But the appetites and temptations to which the flesh is subject can if permitted overwhelm and dominate the spirit Paul said I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me For I delight in the law of God after the inward man But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members Rom 7 21 23 Nephi expressed similar feelings Notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord in showing me his great and marvelous works my heart exclaimeth O wretched man that I am Yea my heart sorroweth because of my flesh my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities I am encompassed about because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me 2 Ne 4 17 18 But then remembering the Savior Nephi stated this hopeful conclusion Nevertheless I know in whom I have trusted 2 Ne 4 19 What did he mean Jesus was also a being of flesh and spirit but He yielded not to temptation see Mosiah 15 5 We can turn to Him as we seek unity and peace within because He understands He understands the struggle and He also understands how to win the struggle As Paul said We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Heb 4 15 Most importantly we may look to Jesus to help restore the inner unity of our soul when we have succumbed to sin and destroyed our peace Soon after His intercessory plea that we might become perfect in one Jesus suffered and gave His life to atone for sin The power of His Atonement can erase the effects of sin in us When we repent His atoning grace justifies and cleanses us see 3 Ne 27 16 20 It is as if we had not succumbed as if we had not yielded to temptation As we endeavor day by day and week by week to follow the path of Christ our spirit asserts its preeminence the battle within subsides and temptations cease to trouble There is greater and greater harmony between the spiritual and the physical until our physical bodies are transformed in Paul s words from instruments of unrighteousness unto sin to instruments of righteousness unto God see Rom 6 13 Becoming at one within ourselves prepares us for the greater blessing of becoming one with God and Christ Jesus achieved perfect unity with the Father by submitting Himself both flesh and spirit to the will of the Father His ministry was always clearly focused because there was no debilitating or distracting double mindedness in Him Referring to His Father Jesus said I do always those things that please him John 8 29 Because it was the Father s will Jesus submitted even to death the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father Mosiah 15 7 This was certainly no small thing That suffering He said caused myself even God the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore and to suffer both body and spirit and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink Nevertheless glory be to the Father and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men D C 19 18 19 These statements reveal that the Savior s overarching ambition is to glorify the Father The Father is in the Son in the sense that the Father s glory and the Father s will are the all consuming occupation of the Son During that Last Supper with His Apostles the Savior said I am the true vine and my Father is the husbandman Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit John 15 1 2 What form that purging may take what sacrifices it may entail we probably cannot know in advance But if with the rich young ruler we were to ask What lack I yet Matt 19 20 the Savior s answer would be the same Come and follow me Matt 19 21 be my disciple as I am the disciple of the Father become as a child submissive meek humble patient full of love willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon you even as a child doth submit to his father Mosiah 3 19 President Brigham Young spoke understandingly of our challenge when he said After all that has been said and done after he has led this people so long do you not perceive that there is a lack of confidence in our God Can you perceive it in yourselves You may ask Brother Brigham do you perceive it in yourself I do I can see that I yet lack confidence to some extent in him whom I trust Why Because I have not the power in consequence of that which the fall has brought upon me Something rises up within me at times that draws a dividing line between my interest and the interest of my Father in heaven something that makes my interest and the interest of my Father in heaven not precisely one We should feel and understand as far as possible as far as fallen nature will let us as far as we can get faith and knowledge to understand ourselves that the interest of that God whom we serve is our interest and that we have no other neither in time nor in eternity Deseret News 10 Sept 1856 212 Surely we will not be one with God and Christ until we make Their will and interest our greatest desire Such submissiveness is not reached in a day but through the Holy Spirit the Lord will tutor us if we are willing until in process of time it may accurately be said that He is in us as the Father is in Him At times I tremble to consider what may be required but I know that it is only in this perfect union that a fulness of joy can be found I am grateful beyond expression that I am invited to be one with those holy beings I revere and worship as my Heavenly Father and Redeemer May God hear the Savior s prayer and lead us all to be one with Them is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Christian theologians have long wrestled with the question What is the destiny of the countless billions who have lived and died with no knowledge of Jesus 1 With the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ has come the understanding of how the unbaptized dead are redeemed and how God can be a perfect just God and a merciful God also 2While yet in life Jesus prophesied that He would also preach to the dead 3 Peter tells us this happened in the interval between the Savior s Crucifixion and Resurrection 4 President Joseph F Smith witnessed in vision that the Savior visited the spirit world and from among the righteous spirits organized his forces and appointed messengers clothed with power and authority and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness These were taught faith in God repentance from sin vicarious baptism for the remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands 5The doctrine that the living can provide baptism and other essential ordinances to the dead vicariously was revealed anew to the Prophet Joseph Smith 6 He learned that the spirits awaiting resurrection are not only offered individual salvation but that they can be bound in heaven as husband and wife and be sealed to their fathers and mothers of all generations past and have sealed to them their children of all generations future The Lord instructed the Prophet that these sacred rites are appropriately performed only in a house built to His name a temple 7The principle of vicarious service should not seem strange to any Christian In the baptism of a living person the officiator acts by proxy in place of the Savior And is it not the central tenet of our faith that Christ s sacrifice atones for our sins by vicariously satisfying the demands of justice for us As President Gordon B Hinckley has expressed I think that vicarious work for the dead more nearly approaches the vicarious sacrifice of the Savior Himself than any other work of which I know It is given with love without hope of compensation or repayment or anything of the kind What a glorious principle 8Some have misunderstood and suppose that deceased souls are being baptised into the Mormon faith without their knowledge 9 or that people who once belonged to other faiths can have the Mormon faith retroactively imposed on them 10 They assume that we somehow have power to force a soul in matters of faith Of course we do not God gave man his agency from the beginning 11 The dead who repent will be redeemed through obedience to the ordinances of the house of God 12 but only if they accept those ordinances The Church does not list them on its rolls or count them in its membership Our anxiety to redeem the dead and the time and resources we put behind that commitment are above all an expression of our witness concerning Jesus Christ It constitutes as powerful a statement as we can make concerning His divine character and mission It testifies first of Christ s Resurrection second of the infinite reach of His Atonement third that He is the sole source of salvation fourth that He has established the conditions for salvation and fifth that He will come again The Power of Christ s ResurrectionAs regards the Resurrection Paul asked Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not why are they then baptized for the dead 13 We are baptized for the dead because we know that they will rise The soul shall be restored to the body and the body to the soul yea and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body yea even a hair of the head shall not be lost but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame 14 For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and living 15It matters tremendously what we do in relation to those who have gone before because they live today as spirits and shall live again as immortal souls and that because of Jesus Christ We believe His words when He said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live 16 By the baptisms we perform in behalf of the dead we testify that as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 17The Infinite Reach of Christ s AtonementBy identifying our ancestors and performing for them the saving ordinances they could not themselves perform we are testifying of the infinite reach of the Atonement of Jesus Christ Christ died for all 18 He is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world 19 God is no respecter of persons But in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him 20 Doth he cry unto any saying Depart from me Behold I say unto you Nay but he saith Come unto me all ye ends of the earth buy milk and honey without money and without price 21 Our Lord inviteth all to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denieth none that come unto him black and white bond and free male and female and he remembereth the heathen and all are alike unto God both Jew and Gentile 22It is inconceivable that this invitation universally extended in life would be rescinded for those who had not heard it before they died With Paul we are persuaded that death poses no such obstacle Neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord 23Jesus Christ the Sole Source of SalvationOur anxiety to ensure that our kindred dead are offered baptism in Jesus name is testament to the fact that Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life and that no man cometh unto the Father but by Him 24 Peter proclaimed Neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved 25 There is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus 26Some contemporary Christians concerned for the billions who have died without a knowledge of Jesus Christ have begun to wonder if there truly is only one Lord one faith one baptism 27 To believe that Jesus is the only savior they say is arrogant narrow minded and intolerant We say however that this is a false dilemma There is no injustice in there being but One through whom salvation may come when that One and His salvation are offered to every soul without exception We need not tamper with the doctrine or temper the good news of Christ Conditions of Salvation Set by ChristBecause we believe that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer we also accept His authority to establish the conditions by which we may receive His grace Otherwise we would not concern ourselves with being baptized for the dead Jesus confirmed that strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life 28 Specifically He said Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God 29 This means we must repent and be baptized every one in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost 30Notwithstanding He was sinless Jesus Christ Himself was baptized and received the Holy Ghost to witness unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments 31 and to show us the straitness of the path and the narrowness of the gate by which we should enter he having set the example before us And He said He that is baptized in my name to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost like unto me wherefore follow me and do the things which ye have seen me do 32There are no exceptions granted none are needed As many as will believe and be baptized including by proxy and endure in faith shall be saved not only those who believed after Christ came in the meridian of time in the flesh but all those from the beginning even as many as were before he came 33 It is for this reason that the gospel is preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spirit 34The Second Coming of Jesus ChristOur work for the dead bears witness that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth In the final verses of the Old Testament Jehovah declared Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse 35In an inspired commentary on this scripture the Prophet Joseph Smith stated The earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children upon some subject or other and behold what is that subject It is the baptism for the dead 36The vicarious ordinances we perform in temples beginning with baptism make possible an eternal welding link between generations that fulfills the purpose of the earth s creation Without this the whole earth would be utterly wasted at Christ s coming 37 Elijah has in fact come as promised to confer the priesthood power that turns hearts and establishes the welding links between the fathers and the children so that once again what is bound on earth shall be bound in heaven 38 When he came Elijah declared The keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near even at the doors 39We are anxiously about the task of searching out our fathers and mothers of generations past and binding them to us and us to them Is not this the strongest possible evidence of our conviction that Jesus Christ will come again to reign upon the earth We know He will and we know what He expects we will have done in preparation for His return In the scriptures the spirits of the dead are sometimes referred to as being in darkness or in prison 40 Contemplating God s glorious plan for the redemption of these His children the Prophet Joseph Smith penned this psalm Let your hearts rejoice and be exceedingly glad Let the earth break forth into singing Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel who hath ordained before the world was that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison for the prisoners shall go free 41Our charge extends as far and as deep as the love of God to encompass His children of every time and place Our efforts on behalf of the dead bear eloquent witness that Jesus Christ is the divine Redeemer of all mankind His grace and promises reach even those who in life do not find Him Because of Him the prisoners shall indeed go free In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In 1918 Brother George Goates was a farmer who raised sugar beets in Lehi Utah Winter came early that year and froze much of his beet crop in the ground For George and his young son Francis the harvest was slow and difficult Meanwhile an influenza epidemic was raging The dreaded disease claimed the lives of George s son Charles and three of Charles s small children two little girls and a boy In the course of only six days a grieving George Goates made three separate trips to Ogden Utah to bring the bodies home for burial At the end of this terrible interlude George and Francis hitched up their wagon and headed back to the beet field On the way they passed wagon after wagon load of beets being hauled to the factory and driven by neighborhood farmers As they passed by each driver would wave a greeting Hi ya Uncle George Sure sorry George Tough break George You ve got a lot of friends George On the last wagon was freckled faced Jasper Rolfe He waved a cheery greeting and called out That s all of em Uncle George Brother Goates turned to Francis and said I wish it was all of ours When they arrived at the farm gate Francis jumped down off the big red beet wagon and opened the gate as his father drove onto the field George pulled up stopped the team and scanned the field There wasn t a sugar beet on the whole field Then it dawned upon him what Jasper Rolfe meant when he called out That s all of em Uncle George George got down off the wagon picked up a handful of the rich brown soil he loved so much and then a beet top and he looked for a moment at these symbols of his labor as if he couldn t believe his eyes Then he sat down on a pile of beet tops this man who brought four of his loved ones home for burial in the course of only six days made caskets dug graves and even helped with the burial clothing this amazing man who never faltered nor flinched nor wavered throughout this agonizing ordeal sat down on a pile of beet tops and sobbed like a little child Then he arose wiped his eyes looked up at the sky and said Thanks Father for the elders of our ward 1It is of such elders that I wish to speak this evening I wish to speak of brothers in the priesthood I wish to speak of the priesthood quorum President Boyd K Packer has explained that in ancient days when a man was appointed to a select body his commission always written in Latin outlined the responsibility of the organization defined who should be members and then invariably contained the words quorum vos unum meaning of whom we will that you be one 2 In the dispensation of the fulness of times the Lord instructed that the priesthood should be organized into quorums meaning selected assemblies of brethren given authority that His business might be transacted and His work proceed A quorum is a brotherhood Membership in a quorum becomes a right of one ordained to an office in the priesthood 3The scriptures establish the quorums of priesthood and their respective duties in the Church of Jesus Christ today including the First Presidency 4 the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles 5 and the Quorums of the Seventy 6 The standing ministers in the stakes of Zion are identified the high priests and elders 7 as are the three quorums of the Aaronic Priesthood the priests teachers and deacons 8Sixty years ago Elder Stephen L Richards then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve provided a characteristically cogent statement of the function of priesthood quorums Said he A quorum is three things first a class second a fraternity and third a service unit 9 Let us examine briefly these three aspects of priesthood quorums First a quorum is a class When a priesthood quorum or group meets as a class its members can learn together be nourished by the good word of God 10 and grow spiritually We study so that we may better teach 11 Beginning this year the priesthood has a curriculum program shared in part by the Relief Society that can revitalize quorums and make them school s of the prophets 12 On the second and third Sundays of the month the course of study is based on the teachings of Presidents of the Church The resource for instruction in 1998 99 is a compilation of excerpts from the sermons of Brigham Young It is a text rich in doctrine and application The curriculum continues on the fourth Sunday with Teachings for Our Time an opportunity to study current gospel issues approved by the First Presidency Brethren you who are the leaders of quorums and groups please study the instructions that have been provided by the First Presidency regarding this new curriculum until you understand them fully Then implement them precisely The Aaronic Priesthood quorums are also blessed with superb class material although it wasn t always so At the beginning of this century while some stakes prepared printed systematic lesson outlines for Aaronic Priesthood quorums others left the young men to find their own way This resulted in some unusual priesthood meetings by our standards One lesser priesthood group for example divided its class time between religious lessons and such adventure books as Tom Sawyer The Jungle Book The Call of the Wild Pigs Is Pigs and Frank Among the Rancheros 13 Today such cultural enrichment is for other times and settings when the quorum meets as a class the time is reserved for things of a higher order Today s Aaronic Priesthood curriculum includes such topics as covenants guide our actions respect for mothers and their divine role valuing and encouraging people with disabilities and moral courage to name just a few Aaronic Priesthood quorums deserve a real priesthood class as part of a solid quorum experience Second a quorum is a fraternity In the October general conference of 1982 Elder Robert L Backman recounted the experience of a young man named Mark Peterson Shortly after his ordination as a deacon the deacons quorum presidency scheduled an appointment with Mark and his parents at their home Promptly at the hour set the doorbell rang The members of the presidency stood on the porch dressed in suits white shirts and ties and each one carrying his scriptures Sitting down with Mark and his parents they began with prayer then handed an agenda to everyone there The president then opened the scriptures having Mark and his father read those references which speak of the power of the Aaronic Priesthood what it is and the particular duties of a deacon The president then spoke about Mark s particular responsibilities and duties how he should dress how he should pass the sacrament act as a messenger collect fast offerings And then they asked him if he had any questions At the end of the visit they welcomed him to the quorum and offered help whenever he needed it As they left Mark said to his Dad They were awesome 14The fraternity of priesthood quorums can indeed be awesome When I became a member of a Quorum of the Seventy I assumed that I might be accepted by my brethren in the course of time if I were able to prove myself worthy of their association I hoped someday to measure up and be approved I was surprised to find myself immediately welcomed and from the outset treated as a brother as an equal by men much more talented and accomplished than I I have been supported and encouraged loved and tutored in my quorum from my very first day of membership in it Consequently I feel a deep desire to contribute to the work of the quorum and to assist my brethren as much as I can President David O McKay taught If priesthood meant only personal distinction or individual elevation there would be no need of groups or quorums The very existence of such groups established by divine authorization proclaims our dependence upon one another the indispensable need of mutual help and assistance 15And let it be remembered that nowhere is the fraternity of quorums more crucial than in the case of newly baptized brethren and their families Quorum and group leaders should provide the leading voice and laboring oar in every ward and branch council regarding retention of converts Third a quorum is a service unit When I spoke earlier of the new Melchizedek Priesthood curriculum I did not mention what takes place on the first Sunday of the month That is a very special meeting On the first Sunday priesthood bearers meet in quorums and groups to learn their duties and plan their work On the agenda are training and discussion reports and assignments It is a time to learn how to administer correctly priesthood ordinances and blessings It is a time for the business of the priesthood It is a time for putting the priesthood to work I can imagine just such a meeting 80 years ago in Lehi Utah as the elders laid a plan to harvest the sugar beets of their beleaguered brother George Goates Both Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood quorums will find their soul in service Our great presiding High Priest and exemplar is Jesus Christ who declared Whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister And whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many 16Years ago President Gordon B Hinckley expressed something of a vision regarding quorums in the priesthood He said It will be a marvelous day my brethren it will be a day of fulfillment of the purposes of the Lord when our priesthood quorums become an anchor of strength to every man belonging thereto when each such man may appropriately be able to say I am a member of a priesthood quorum of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I stand ready to assist my brethren in all of their needs as I am confident they stand ready to assist me in mine Working together we shall grow spiritually as covenant sons of God Working together we can stand without embarrassment and without fear against every wind of adversity that might blow be it economic social or spiritual 17We must not delay or wait longer for this great day of fulfillment Each of you who has received an ordination in the priesthood belongs to a quorum If you live in a place where there are not enough brethren to form a quorum you are a member of a priesthood group that will become a quorum Resolve now to do all within your power to make of your priesthood quorum one worthy of the name and one faithful to its mission Study with your brethren in the quorum class Stand with them in the quorum fraternity Work with them in quorum service The quorum brethren the quorum in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Knowing that I might be invited to speak today my daughter left me a kind note this morning and at the end she added P S Don t trip So far so good Not long after I was ordained a deacon my bishop Leon Walker asked me into his office to give me an assignment He handed me a bright key the key to the chapel and charged me with responsibility to help look after the building I considered myself one of the most fortunate boys in the world to have an assignment from my priesthood president I thought this would not be a difficult task My home was just a one minute bicycle ride away from the building But I soon learned what I suppose all bishops know and that is that everybody in the ward seems to have a key to the building As soon as I had the building locked up on an evening someone came along behind me and opened a door As soon as I had opened a Primary classroom some diligent soul was there behind me to lock it up again I could hardly stay on top of that job But I began to learn then as I have come to understand since that any call any service in our Lord s cause sanctifies us Whether it is performed in the glare of the public eye or in a quiet corner known only to God is of no consequence What matters is that we do serve for by serving we keep our covenants with Deity and in those covenants is the promise of salvation Today I honor and express my love to those who taught me the covenants and in so many other ways blessed my life a noble father a blessed mother grandparents great grandparents and extended family mentors and friends both in and out of the Church My children cannot as yet fully understand how deeply they bless my life by their loyalty to the Savior and his gospel I honor them for that Those who know my Kathy have observed that I married much above myself a conclusion I heartily agree with Our marriage is a gratifying thing and I have not adequate words to express my love As I have agonized in recent hours over the acceptability and adequacy of my offering upon the altar of him who gave his all it has come to me that I must focus outwardly that as I seek the interest of his flock and lose myself in their service his grace shall be sufficient for me I so commit myself unreservedly I readily attest to the reality and greatness of our God to his goodness and grace to his justice and mercy to the truth of his gospel and the power of his priesthood and the authenticity of the calling of his latter day seers At the outset of this ministry I acknowledge that anything I may achieve will be by virtue of the power and the grace and the gift of God I am not in Isaiah s words the axe that shall boast itself against him that heweth therewith I am not the saw that shall magnify itself against him that shaketh it Isa 10 15 With Nephi I know in whom I have trusted See 2 Ne 4 19 I am particularly gratified and it is of great significance to me that I may at any moment and in any circumstance approach through prayer the throne of grace that my Heavenly Father will hear my petition that my Advocate him who did no sin whose blood was shed will plead my cause See D C 45 3 5 I rely heavily on that access to God which he gives to all his children for he is indeed no respecter of persons and he that asks shall receive I so witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen
