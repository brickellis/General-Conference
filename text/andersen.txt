Eighteen years after the First Vision the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote an extensive account of his experience He had faced opposition persecution harassment threats and brutal attacks 1 Yet he continued to boldly testify of his First Vision I had actually seen a light and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages and they did in reality speak to me and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision yet it was true I knew it and I knew that God knew it and I could not deny it 2In his difficult hours Joseph s memory reached back nearly two decades to the certainty of God s love for him and the events that welcomed in the long foretold Restoration Reflecting on his spiritual journey Joseph said I don t blame any one for not believing my history If I had not experienced what I have I would not have believed it myself 3But the experiences were real and he never forgot or denied them quietly confirming his testimony as he moved to Carthage I am going like a lamb to the slaughter he said but I am calm as a summer s morning I have a conscience void of offense towards God and towards all men 4Your Spiritually Defining ExperiencesThere is a lesson for us in the Prophet Joseph s example Along with the peaceful direction we receive from the Holy Ghost from time to time God powerfully and very personally assures each of us that He knows us and loves us and that He is blessing us specifically and openly Then in our moments of difficulty the Savior brings these experiences back into our mind Think of your own life Over the years I have listened to thousands of profoundly spiritual experiences from Latter day Saints all across the world confirming to me beyond any question that God knows and loves each of us and that He eagerly desires to reveal Himself to us These experiences may come at pivotal times in our lives or in what may at first seem as uneventful happenings but they are always accompanied by an exceptionally strong spiritual confirmation of the love of God Remembering these spiritually defining experiences takes us to our knees declaring as did the Prophet Joseph What I received was from heaven I know it and I know that God knows that I know it 5Four ExamplesReflect on your own spiritually defining memories as I share a few examples from others Years ago an elderly stake patriarch with two failing heart valves pleaded for then Dr Russell M Nelson to intervene although at that time there was not a surgical solution for the damaged second valve Dr Nelson finally agreed to do the surgery Here are President Nelson s words After relieving the obstruction of the first valve we exposed the second valve We found it to be intact but so badly dilated that it could no longer function as it should While examining this valve a message was distinctly impressed upon my mind Reduce the circumference of the ring I announced that message to my assistant The valve tissue will be sufficient if we can effectively reduce the ring toward its normal size But how A picture came vividly to my mind showing how stitches could be placed to make a pleat here and a tuck there I still remember that mental image complete with dotted lines where sutures should be placed The repair was completed as diagrammed in my mind We tested the valve and found the leak to be reduced remarkably My assistant said It s a miracle 6 The patriarch lived for many years Dr Nelson had been directed And he knew that God knew that he knew he had been directed Kathy and I first met Beatrice Magr in France 30 years ago Beatrice recently told me of an experience that impacted her spiritual life shortly after her baptism as a teenager Here are her words The youth of our branch had traveled with their leaders to Lacanau Beach an hour and a half from Bordeaux Before returning home one of the leaders decided to take a last swim and dove into the waves with his glasses When he resurfaced his glasses had disappeared They were lost in the ocean The loss of his glasses would prevent him from driving his car We would be stranded far from home A sister filled with faith suggested that we pray I murmured that praying would avail us absolutely nothing and I uneasily joined the group to pray publicly as we stood waist deep in the murky water Once the prayer was over I stretched my arms to splash everyone As I was sweeping the ocean s surface his pair of glasses rested in my hand A powerful feeling pierced my soul that God does actually hear and answer our prayers 7Forty five years later she recalled it as if it had happened yesterday Beatrice had been blessed and she knew that God knew that she knew that she had been blessed The experiences of President Nelson and Sister Magr were very different yet for both an unforgettable spiritually defining memory of God s love was embedded in their hearts These defining events often come in learning about the restored gospel or in sharing the gospel with others This picture was taken in S o Paulo Brazil in 2004 Floripes Luzia Damasio of the Ipatinga Brazil Stake was 114 years old Speaking of her conversion Sister Damasio told me that missionaries in her village had given a priesthood blessing to a critically ill baby who miraculously recovered She wanted to know more As she prayed about their message an undeniable witness of the Spirit confirmed to her that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God At 103 she was baptized and at 104 she was endowed Every year after she made the 14 hour bus ride to spend a week in the temple Sister Damasio had received a heavenly confirmation and she knew that God knew that she knew that the witness was true Here is a spiritual memory from my first mission to France 48 years ago While tracting my companion and I left a Book of Mormon with an elderly woman When we returned to the woman s apartment about a week later she opened the door Before any words were spoken I felt a tangible spiritual power The intense feelings continued as Madame Alice Audubert invited us in and told us she had read the Book of Mormon and knew that it was true As we left her apartment that day I prayed Heavenly Father please help me to never forget what I have just felt I never have In a seemingly ordinary moment at a door much like hundreds of other doors I had felt the power of heaven And I knew that God knew that I knew that a window of heaven had been opened Individualized and UndeniableThese spiritually defining moments come at different times and in different ways individualized for each of us Think of your favorite examples in the scriptures Those listening to the Apostle Peter were pricked in their heart s 8 The Lamanite woman Abish believed the remarkable vision of her father 9 And a voice came into the mind of Enos 10My friend Clayton Christensen described an experience during a very prayerful reading of the Book of Mormon this way A beautiful warm loving Spirit surrounded me and permeated my soul enveloping me in a feeling of love that I had not imagined I could feel and these feelings continued night after night 11There are times when spiritual feelings go down into our heart like fire illuminating our soul Joseph Smith explained that we sometimes receive sudden strokes of ideas and occasionally the pure flow of intelligence 12President Dallin H Oaks in responding to a sincere man who claimed never to have had such an experience counseled Perhaps your prayers have been answered again and again but you have had your expectations fixed on a sign so grand or a voice so loud that you think you have had no answer 13 The Savior Himself spoke of a people with great faith who were blessed with fire and with the Holy Ghost but who knew it not 14How Do You Hear Him We have recently heard President Russell M Nelson say I invite you to think deeply and often about this key question How do you hear Him I also invite you to take steps to hear Him better and more often 15 He repeated that invitation this morning We hear Him in our prayers in our homes in the scriptures in our hymns as we worthily partake of the sacrament as we declare our faith as we serve others and as we attend the temple with fellow believers Spiritually defining moments come as we prayerfully listen to general conference and as we better keep the commandments And children these experiences are for you as well Remember Jesus did teach and minister unto the children and the children did speak great and marvelous things 16 The Lord said This knowledge is given by my Spirit unto you and save it were by my power you could not have it Wherefore you can testify that you have heard my voice and know my words 17We can hear Him because of the blessing of the Savior s incomparable Atonement While we cannot choose the timing of receiving these defining moments President Henry B Eyring gave this counsel in our preparation Tonight and tomorrow night you might pray and ponder asking the questions Did God send a message that was just for me Did I see His hand in my life or the lives of my family 18 Faith obedience humility and real intent open the windows of heaven 19An IllustrationYou might think of your spiritual memories this way With constant prayer a determination to keep our covenants and the gift of the Holy Ghost we navigate our way through life When personal difficulty doubt or discouragement darken our path or when world conditions beyond our control lead us to wonder about the future the spiritually defining memories from our book of life are like luminous stones that help brighten the road ahead assuring us that God knows us loves us and has sent His Son Jesus Christ to help us return home And when someone sets their defining memories aside and is lost or confused we turn them toward the Savior as we share our faith and memories with them helping them rediscover those precious spiritual moments they once treasured Some experiences are so sacred that we guard them in our spiritual memory and do not share them 20 Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost wherefore they speak the words of Christ 21 Angels have not ceased to minister unto the children of men For behold they are subject unto Christ to minister according to his command showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness 22And the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance 23Embrace your sacred memories Believe them Write them down Share them with your family Trust that they come to you from your Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son 24 Let them bring patience to your doubts and understanding to your difficulties 25 I promise you that as you willingly acknowledge and carefully treasure the spiritually defining events in your life more and more will come to you Heavenly Father knows you and loves you Jesus is the Christ His gospel has been restored and as we remain faithful I witness we will be His forever in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I know what you are thinking Just one more speaker and we will hear from President Nelson Hoping to keep you alert for a few minutes as we await our beloved prophet I have selected a very appealing topic my subject is fruit With the color texture and sweetness of berries bananas watermelons and mangoes or of more exotic fruit like kiwano or pomegranate fruit has long been a treasured delicacy During His earthly ministry the Savior compared good fruit to things of eternal worth He said Ye shall know them by their fruits 1 Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit 2 He encouraged us to gather fruit unto life eternal 3In a vivid dream that we all know well in the Book of Mormon the prophet Lehi finds himself in a dark and dreary wilderness There is filthy water a mist of darkness strange roads and forbidden paths as well as a rod of iron4 along a strait and narrow path leading to a beautiful tree with fruit that makes one happy Recounting the dream Lehi says I did partake of the fruit it was most sweet above all that I had ever tasted And it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy This fruit was more desirable than any other fruit 5The Meaning of the Tree and the FruitWhat does this tree with its most precious fruit symbolize It represents the love of God 6 and proclaims our Heavenly Father s marvelous plan of redemption For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life 7This precious fruit symbolizes the wondrous blessings of the Savior s incomparable Atonement Not only will we live again following our mortality but through our faith in Jesus Christ our repentance and our keeping the commandments we can be forgiven of our sins and one day stand clean and pure before our Father and His Son Partaking of the fruit of the tree also symbolizes that we embrace the ordinances and covenants of the restored gospel being baptized receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost and entering the house of the Lord to be endowed with power from on high Through the grace of Jesus Christ and by honoring our covenants we receive the immeasurable promise of living with our righteous family throughout eternity 8No wonder the angel described the fruit as the most joyous to the soul 9 It truly is The Challenge of Staying TrueAs we have all learned even after savoring the precious fruit of the restored gospel staying true and faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ is still not easily done As has been said many times in this conference we continue to face distractions and deceptions confusion and commotion enticements and temptations that attempt to pull our hearts away from the Savior and the joys and beauties we have experienced in following Him Because of this adversity Lehi s dream also includes a warning On the other side of the river is a spacious building with people of all ages pointing their fingers mocking and scoffing at the righteous followers of Jesus Christ The people in the building are ridiculing and laughing at those keeping the commandments hoping to discredit and deride their faith in Jesus Christ and in His gospel And because of the verbal attacks of doubt and disdain launched at the believers some of those who have tasted of the fruit begin to feel ashamed of the gospel they once embraced The false allures of the world seduce them they turn away from the tree and from the fruit and in the words of the scripture fall away into forbidden paths and are lost 10In our world today the adversary s construction crews are working overtime hastily inflating the large and spacious building The expansion has spread across the river hoping to envelop our homes while the pointers and the scoffers wail day and night on their internet megaphones 11President Nelson explained The adversary is quadrupling his efforts to disrupt testimonies and impede the work of the Lord 12 Let us remember Lehi s words We heeded them not 13Although we need not fear we are to be on guard At times little things can upend our spiritual balance Please don t allow your questions the insults of others faithless friends or unfortunate mistakes and disappointments to turn you away from the sweet pure and soul satisfying blessings that come from the precious fruit of the tree Keep your eyes and your hearts centered on the Savior Jesus Christ and the eternal joy that comes only through Him The Faith of Jason HallIn June my wife Kathy and I attended the funeral of Jason Hall At the time of his passing he was 48 years old and serving as an elders quorum president Here are Jason s words about an event that changed his life At age 15 I was in a diving accident I broke my neck and was paralyzed from the chest down I lost complete control of my legs and partial control of my arms I could no longer walk stand or feed myself I could barely breathe or speak 14 Dear Father in Heaven I begged if I could only have my hands I know I could make it Please Father please Keep my legs Father I just pray for the use of my hands 15Jason never received the use of his hands Can you hear the voices from the spacious building Jason Hall God does not hear your prayers If God is a loving God how could He leave you like this Why have faith in Christ Jason Hall heard their voices but he did not heed them Instead he feasted upon the fruit of the tree His faith in Jesus Christ became immovable He graduated from the university and married Kolette Coleman in the temple describing her as the love of his life 16 After 16 years of marriage another miracle their precious son Coleman was born How did they grow their faith Kolette explained We trusted in God s plan And it gave us hope We knew that Jason would in a future day be whole We knew that God provided us a Savior whose atoning sacrifice enables us to keep looking forward when we want to give up 17Speaking at Jason s funeral 10 year old Coleman said his dad taught him Heavenly Father has a plan for us earth life would be awesome and we could live in families But we would have to go through hard things and we would make mistakes Coleman continued Heavenly Father sent His Son Jesus to earth His job was to be perfect To heal people To love them And then to suffer for all of our pain sorrows and sins Then He died for us Then Coleman added Because He did this Jesus knows how I feel right now Three days after Jesus died He came alive again with His body perfect This is important to me because I know that my dad s body will be perfect and we will be together as a family Coleman concluded Every night since I was a baby my dad said to me Dad loves you Heavenly Father loves you and you re a good boy 18Joy Comes Because of Jesus ChristPresident Russell M Nelson described why the Hall family feels joy and hope He said The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives When the focus of our lives is on God s plan of salvation and Jesus Christ and His gospel we can feel joy regardless of what is happening or not happening in our lives Joy comes from and because of Him He is the source of all joy If we look to the world we will never know joy Joy is the gift that comes from intentionally trying to live a righteous life as taught by Jesus Christ 19A Promise as You ReturnIf you have been without the fruit of the tree for some time please know that the Savior s arms are always outstretched to you He lovingly beckons Repent and come unto me 20 His fruit is plentiful and always in season It cannot be purchased with money and no one who honestly desires it is denied 21If you desire to return to the tree and taste the fruit once again begin by praying to your Heavenly Father Believe in Jesus Christ and the power of His atoning sacrifice I promise you that as you look to the Savior in every thought 22 the fruit of the tree will be yours once again delicious to your taste joyous to your soul the greatest of all the gifts of God 23Three weeks ago today I saw the joy of the Savior s fruit on full display as Kathy and I attended the Lisbon Portugal Temple dedication The truths of the restored gospel opened to Portugal in 1975 as religious freedom became available Many noble Saints who first tasted of the fruit when there were no congregations no chapels and no temple closer than 1 000 miles 1 600 km rejoiced with us that the precious fruit of the tree is now in a house of the Lord in Lisbon Portugal How I honor and revere these Latter day Saints who have kept their hearts riveted on the Savior The Savior said He that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing 24Speaking this morning to the members of the Church across the world President Nelson said My dear brothers and sisters you are living exemplars of the fruits that come from following the teachings of Jesus Christ Then he added I thank you I love you 25We love you President Nelson I am an eyewitness to the power of revelation that rests upon our dear President He is the prophet of God Like Lehi of old President Russell M Nelson beckons to us and all of God s family to come and partake of the fruit of the tree May we have the humility and strength to follow his counsel I humbly witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God His love His power and His grace bring all things of lasting worth I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Shortly before His Crucifixion Jesus was taken before Pilate in the judgment hall Art thou the King of the Jews Pilate condescendingly asked Jesus responded My kingdom is not of this world I came into the world that I should bear witness of the truth Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice Pilate cynically asked What is truth 1In today s world the question What is truth can be painfully complex to the secular mind A Google search for What is truth brings more than a million responses We have more available information on our cell phones than in all the books of a brick and mortar library We live with information and opinion overload Enticing and alluring voices pursue us at every turn Caught in today s confusion it is no wonder that so many consign themselves to the words spoken 2 500 years ago by Protagoras to the young Socrates What is true for you he said is true for you and what is true for me is true for me 2Truth through the Restored Gospel of Jesus ChristBlessed with the restored gospel of Jesus Christ we humbly declare that there are some things that are completely and absolutely true These eternal truths are the same for every son and daughter of God The scriptures teach Truth is knowledge of things as they are and as they were and as they are to come 3 Truth looks backward and forward expanding the perspective of our small point in time Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life 4 Truth shows us the way to eternal life and it comes only through our Savior Jesus Christ There is no other way Jesus Christ teaches us how to live and through His Atonement and Resurrection He offers us forgiveness from our sins and immortality beyond the veil This is absolutely true He teaches us that it does not matter if we are rich or poor prominent or unknown sophisticated or simple Rather our mortal quest is to strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ to choose good over evil and to keep His commandments While we celebrate the innovations of science and medicine the truths of God go far beyond these discoveries In opposition to the truths of eternity there always have been counterfeits to distract God s children from the truth The arguments of the adversary are always the same Listen to these voiced 2 000 years ago You cannot know of things you do not see Whatever a person does is no crime God is not blessing you but every person prosper s according to his own genius 5 It is not reasonable that such a being as Christ would be the Son of God 6 What you believe is a foolish tradition and a derangement of your mind 7 Sounds like today doesn t it With the Restoration of the gospel God has given us the way to learn and know essential spiritual truths we learn them through the holy scriptures through our personal prayers and our own experiences through the counsel of the living prophets and apostles and through the guidance of the Holy Ghost who can help us to know the truth of all things 8Truth Is Spiritually DiscernedWe can know the things of God as we seek them spiritually Paul said The things of God knoweth no man except he has the Spirit of God For they are spiritually discerned 9Look at this art by Michael Murphy From this perspective you would hardly believe that it is an artistic rendition of a human eye However as you look at the dots from a different perspective you see the beauty of the artist s creation Likewise we see the spiritual truths of God through the perspective of an eye of faith Paul said The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned 10The scriptures our prayers our own experiences modern prophets and the gift of the Holy Ghost bring us the spiritual perspective of truth necessary for our journey here on earth The Proclamation through the Eye of FaithLet s look at the proclamation on the family through the eye of faith President Gordon B Hinckley introduced The Family A Proclamation to the World with this statement With so much of sophistry that is passed off as truth with so much of deception concerning standards and values with so much of allurement and enticement to take on the slow stain of the world we have felt to warn you 11The proclamation begins All human beings male and female are created in the image of God Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents and as such each has a divine nature and destiny These are eternal truths You and I are not an accident of nature I love these words In the premortal realm spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan 12We lived before our birth Our individual identity is stamped in us forever In ways we don t fully understand our spiritual growth there in the premortal world influences who we are here 13 We accepted God s plan We knew that we would experience difficulties pain and sorrow upon the earth 14 We also knew that the Savior would come and that as we proved ourselves worthy we would rise in the Resurrection having glory added upon our heads for ever and ever 15The proclamation is direct We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God s eternal plan Our Father s plan encourages a husband and wife to bring children into the world and obligates us to speak in defense of the unborn Principles of the Proclamation Are Beautifully ConnectedIf we pick and choose what we accept in the proclamation we cloud our eternal view putting too much importance on our experience here and now By prayerfully pondering the proclamation through the eye of faith we better understand how the principles are beautifully connected supporting one another revealing our Father s plan for His children 16Should we really be surprised when the Lord s prophets declare His will and for some questions remain Of course some reject the voice of the prophets immediately 17 but others prayerfully ponder their honest questions questions that will be settled with patience and an eye of faith If the proclamation had been revealed in a different century there would still have been questions just different questions than those of today One purpose of prophets is to help us in resolving sincere questions 18Prior to being the President of the Church President Russell M Nelson said Prophets see ahead They see the harrowing dangers the adversary has placed or will yet place in our path Prophets also foresee the grand possibilities and privileges awaiting those who listen with the intent to obey 19I testify to the truth and spiritual power of the united voice of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve The World Walking AwayIn my lifetime we have seen a dramatic change in the world s beliefs about many of the principles taught in the proclamation During my teenage and early married years many in the world walked away from the Lord s standard we call the law of chastity that sexual relations are to occur only between a man and a woman who are lawfully married In my 20s and 30s many walked away from the sacred protection of the unborn as abortion became more acceptable In more recent years many have walked away from God s law that marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman 20Watching many walking away from the boundaries the Lord has set reminds us of that day in Capernaum when the Savior declared His divinity and sadly many of his disciples walked away The Savior then turned to the Twelve Will ye also go away Peter answered Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the living God 21Not All Fit Neatly inside the ProclamationThere are so many young and old who are loyal and true to the gospel of Jesus Christ even though their own current experience does not fit neatly inside the family proclamation children whose lives have been shaken by divorce youth whose friends mock the law of chastity divorced women and men who have been gravely wounded by the unfaithfulness of a spouse husbands and wives who are unable to have children women and men who are married to a spouse who does not share their faith in the restored gospel single women and men who for various reasons have been unable to marry One friend of nearly 20 years whom I admire greatly is not married because of same sex attraction He has remained true to his temple covenants has expanded his creative and professional talents and has served nobly in both the Church and the community He recently said to me I can sympathize with those in my situation who choose not to keep the law of chastity in the world in which we live But didn t Christ ask us to be not of this world It is clear that God s standards are different from those of the world The laws of man often move outside the boundaries set by the laws of God For those desiring to please God faith patience and diligence are surely needed 22My wife Kathy and I have known a single sister now in her mid 40s who is gifted in her professional abilities and serves valiantly in her ward She too has kept the laws of God She wrote I dreamed of the day I would be blessed with a husband and children I am still waiting At times my situation brings feelings of being forgotten and alone but I try to keep the focus off what I don t have and instead on what I do have and how I can help others Service to my extended family in my ward and in the temple has helped me I am not forgotten or alone because I am part of and we are all part of a larger family There Is One Who UnderstandsSome will say You don t understand my situation I may not but I testify that there is One who does understand 23 There is One who knows your burdens because of His sacrifice made in the garden and on the cross As you seek Him and keep His commandments I promise you that He will bless you and lift the burdens too heavy to bear alone He will give you eternal friends and opportunities to serve More important He will fill you with the powerful Spirit of the Holy Ghost and shine His heavenly approval upon you No choice no alternative that denies the companionship of the Holy Ghost or the blessings of eternity is worthy of our consideration I know the Savior lives I witness that He is the source of all truth that really matters and that He will fulfill all the blessings He has promised to those who keep His commandments In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On March 22 2016 just before eight o clock in the morning two terrorist bombs exploded in the Brussels Airport Elder Richard Norby Elder Mason Wells and Elder Joseph Empey had taken Sister Fanny Clain to the airport for a flight to her mission in Cleveland Ohio Thirty two people lost their lives and all of the missionaries were wounded The most seriously wounded was Elder Richard Norby age 66 serving with his wife Sister Pam Norby Elder Norby reflected on that moment Instantly I knew what had happened I tried to run for safety but I immediately fell down I could see that my left leg was badly injured I noticed black almost spiderweb type soot drooping from both hands I gently pulled at it but realized it was not soot but my skin that had been burned My white shirt was turning red from an injury on my back As the consciousness of what had just happened filled my mind I had this very strong thought the Savior knew where I was what had just transpired and what I was experiencing at that moment 1There were difficult days ahead for Richard Norby and for his wife Pam He was placed in an induced coma followed by surgeries infections and great uncertainty Richard Norby lived but his life would never be the same Two and a half years later his wounds are still healing a brace replaces the missing part of his leg each step is different than before that moment at the Brussels Airport Why would this happen to Richard and Pam Norby 2 They had been true to their covenants served a previous mission in the Ivory Coast and raised a wonderful family Someone could understandably say It isn t fair It just isn t right They were giving their lives for the gospel of Jesus Christ how could this happen This Is MortalityAlthough the details will differ the tragedies the unanticipated tests and trials both physical and spiritual come to each of us because this is mortality As I thought this morning of the speakers in just this session of conference it occurred to me that two have lost children and three have lost grandchildren who unexpectedly returned to their heavenly home None has been spared sickness and sadness and as has been spoken this very week an angel on earth whom we all love Sister Barbara Ballard stepped gently through the veil President Ballard we will never forget your testimony this morning We search for happiness We long for peace We hope for love And the Lord showers us with an amazing abundance of blessings But intermingled with the joy and happiness one thing is certain there will be moments hours days sometimes years when your soul will be wounded The scriptures teach that we will taste the bitter and the sweet3 and that there will be opposition in all things 4 Jesus said Your Father maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust 5Wounds of the soul are not unique to the rich or the poor to one culture one nation or one generation They come to all and are part of the learning we receive from this mortal experience The Righteous Are Not ImmuneMy message today is especially to those who are keeping the commandments of God keeping their promises to God and like the Norbys and many other men women and children in this worldwide audience are confronted with trials and challenges that are unexpected and painful Our wounds may come from a natural disaster or an unfortunate accident They may come from an unfaithful husband or wife turning life upside down for a righteous spouse and children The wounds may come from the darkness and gloom of depression from an unanticipated illness from the suffering or premature death of someone we love from the sadness of a family member dismissing his or her faith from the loneliness when circumstances do not bring an eternal companion or from a hundred other heart wrenching painful sorrows that the eye can t see 6We each understand that difficulties are part of life but when they come to us personally they can take our breath away Without being alarmed we need to be ready The Apostle Peter said Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you 7 Along with the bright colors of happiness and joy the darker colored threads of trial and tragedy are woven deeply into the fabric of our Father s plan These struggles although difficult often become our greatest teachers 8When telling the miraculous story of Helaman s 2 060 young soldiers we love this scripture According to the goodness of God and to our great astonishment and also the joy of our whole army there was not one soul of them who did perish But the sentence continues And neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds 9 Each one of the 2 060 received many wounds and each one of us will be wounded in the battle of life whether physically spiritually or both Jesus Christ Is Our Good SamaritanNever give up however deep the wounds of your soul whatever their source wherever or whenever they happen and however short or long they persist you are not meant to perish spiritually You are meant to survive spiritually and blossom in your faith and trust in God God did not create our spirits to be independent of Him Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ through the incalculable gift of His Atonement not only saves us from death and offers us through repentance forgiveness for our sins but He also stands ready to save us from the sorrows and pains of our wounded souls 10The Savior is our Good Samaritan 11 sent to heal the brokenhearted 12 He comes to us when others pass us by With compassion He places His healing balm on our wounds and binds them up He carries us He cares for us He bids us Come unto me and I shall heal you 13 And Jesus shall suffer pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind that he might take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people taking upon Himself our infirmities being filled with mercy 14Come ye disconsolate where er ye languish Come to the mercy seat fervently kneel Here bring your wounded hearts here tell your anguish Earth has no sorrow that heav n cannot heal 15At a time of enormous suffering the Lord told the Prophet Joseph All these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good 16 How can painful wounds be for our good In the crucible of earthly trials patiently move forward and the Savior s healing power will bring you light understanding peace and hope 17Don t Ever Give UpPray with all your heart Strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ in His reality in His grace Hold on to His words My grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness 18Remember repentance is powerful spiritual medicine 19 Keep the commandments and be worthy of the Comforter remembering that the Savior promised I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you 20The peace of the temple is a soothing balm to the wounded soul Return to the Lord s house with your wounded heart and your family names as frequently as possible The temple projects our brief moment in mortality onto the wide screen of eternity 21Look backward remembering that you proved your worthiness in your premortal state You are a valiant child of God and with His help you can triumph in the battles of this fallen world You have done it before and you can do it again Look forward Your troubles and sorrows are very real but they will not last forever 22 Your dark night will pass because the Son did rise with healing in his wings 23The Norbys told me Disappointment comes to visit on occasion but is never allowed to stay 24 The Apostle Paul said We are troubled yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed 25 You may be exhausted but don t ever give up 26Even with your own painful wounds you will instinctively reach out to others trusting in the Savior s promise Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it 27 The wounded who nurse the wounds of others are God s angels on earth In just a few moments we will listen to our beloved prophet President Russell M Nelson a man of undaunted faith in Jesus Christ a man of hope and peace loved by God but not spared from the wounds of the soul In 1995 his daughter Emily while expecting a child was diagnosed with cancer There were days of hope and happiness as her healthy baby was delivered But the cancer returned and their beloved Emily would pass from this life just two weeks after her 37th birthday leaving her loving husband and five young children In general conference shortly after her passing President Nelson confided My tears of sorrow have flowed along with wishes that I could have done more for our daughter If I had the power of resurrection I would have been tempted to bring her back But Jesus Christ holds those keys and will use them for Emily and for all people in the Lord s own time 28Last month while visiting the Saints in Puerto Rico and remembering last year s devastating hurricane President Nelson spoke with love and compassion This is part of life It s why we re here We are here to have a body and to be tried and tested Some of those tests are physical some are spiritual and your trials here have been both physical and spiritual 29 You have not given up We are so proud of you You faithful Saints have lost much but through it all you have fostered your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ 30 By keeping God s commandments we can find joy even in the midst of our worst circumstances 31All Tears Shall Be Wiped AwayMy brothers and sisters it is my promise to you that increasing your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will bring you added strength and greater hope For you the righteous the Healer of our souls in His time and His way will heal all your wounds 32 No injustice no persecution no trial no sadness no heartache no suffering no wound however deep however wide however painful will be excluded from the comfort peace and lasting hope of Him whose open arms and whose wounded hands will welcome us back into His presence At that day the Apostle John testifies the righteous which come out of great tribulation 33 will stand arrayed in white robes before the throne of God The Lamb will dwell among us and God shall wipe away all tears from your eyes 34 This day will come I so witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I add my welcome to Elder Gerrit Gong and Elder Ulisses Soares to the unparalleled brotherhood of the Quorum of the Twelve In sustaining President Russell M Nelson as the Lord s prophet and as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints we were part of a divinely decreed solemn assembly solemn because the events of this past hour have been anticipated in the heavens since before the world was The Lord Jesus Christ who directs His work has today through President Eyring presented His prophet His anointed leader to us His covenant people allowing us publicly to manifest our willingness to sustain him and follow his counsel To those millions of members who are not here with us in the Conference Center I want you to know that the Spirit of the Lord in this building during the sustaining of President Nelson was exactly as you would have anticipated it full of spiritual power But our heaven directed assembly is not in this Conference Center alone but across the world in chapels in Asia Africa and North America in homes in Central and South America and Europe on covered patios in the Pacific and the islands of the sea This assembly is in whatever part of the world you might be even if your connection is no more than the audio of your smartphone Our raised hands were not counted by our bishops but they were surely noted in heaven as our covenant is with God and our action is recorded in the book of life The Lord Chooses His ProphetThe selection of a prophet is made by the Lord Himself There is no campaigning no debates no posturing for position no dissension distrust confusion or commotion I too confirm that the power of heaven was with us in the upper room of the temple as we prayerfully encircled President Nelson and felt the undeniable approval of the Lord upon him President Nelson s selection to serve as God s prophet was made long ago The Lord s words to Jeremiah also apply to President Nelson Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations 1 Only three years ago Elder Nelson at age 90 was fourth in seniority with two of the three senior Apostles being younger in age than he was The Lord who controls life and death selects His prophet President Nelson at age 93 is in amazing health We hope he will be with us for another decade or two but for now we are trying to persuade him to stay off the ski slopes While we sustain the prophet as the Lord s anointed let it be clear that we worship only God our Heavenly Father and His divine Son It is through the merits the mercy and the grace of our Savior Jesus Christ that we can one day enter again into Their presence 2Why We Follow the ProphetBut Jesus also taught an important truth about the servants He sends to us He that receiveth you He said receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me 3The most important role of the Lord s prophet is to teach us of the Savior and lead us to Him There are many logical reasons to follow President Russell M Nelson Even those not of our faith would call him brilliant He was a medical doctor at age 22 an esteemed cardiac surgeon and a renowned pioneer in the development of open heart surgery Most would acknowledge his wisdom and judgment nine decades of learning about life and death living unselfishly loving and teaching God s children in every corner of the globe and maturing with the experiences of having 10 children 57 grandchildren and 118 great grandchildren this last number changes frequently a great grandson was born only this past Wednesday Those who know him well would speak of President Nelson facing the difficulties of life with faith and courage When cancer took the life of his 37 year old daughter Emily leaving a loving husband and five small children I heard him say I was her father a medical doctor and an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ but I had to bow my head and acknowledge Not my will but thine be done 4A Watchman on the TowerAlthough we admire all of these noble qualities why do we follow President Nelson Why do we follow the prophet Because the Lord Jesus Christ has called him and designated him as His watchman on the tower Carcassonne is a remarkable walled city in France that has stood since medieval times Tall towers surge upward from its protected walls built for watchmen who stood on those towers day and night keeping their attention riveted in the distance for the enemy When the watchman saw an enemy approaching his warning voice protected the people of Carcassonne from the impending danger they could not see A prophet is a watchman on the tower protecting us from spiritual dangers we may not see The Lord said to Ezekiel I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth and warn them from me 5We often speak of our need to follow the prophet but consider this heavy burden the Lord places upon His prophet If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked and that wicked man die in his iniquity his blood will I require at thine hand 6A Greater Personal WitnessWe embrace President Nelson as we would have embraced Peter or Moses if we had lived in their day God told Moses I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say 7 We listen to the Lord s prophet with the faith that his words are from the Lord s own mouth 8Is this blind faith No it is not We each have a spiritual witness of the truthfulness of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ By our own will and choice we raised our hand this morning declaring our desire to sustain the Lord s prophet with our confidence faith and prayer s 9 and to follow his counsel We have the privilege as Latter day Saints to receive a personal witness that President Nelson s call is from God While my wife Kathy has known President Nelson personally for nearly three decades and has no question about his divine mantle upon his setting apart she began reading all his general conference talks of the past 34 years praying for an even deeper assurance of his prophetic role I promise you that this greater witness will come to you as you humbly and worthily seek it Why are we so willing to follow the voice of our prophet For those diligently seeking eternal life the prophet s voice brings spiritual safety in very turbulent times We live on a planet clamoring with a million voices The internet our smartphones our bloated boxes of entertainment all plead for our attention and thrust their influence upon us hoping we will buy their products and adopt their standards The seemingly endless array of information and opinion remind us of the scriptural warnings of being tossed to and fro 10 driven with the wind 11 and overcome by the cunning craftiness of those who lie in wait to deceive 12Anchoring our souls to the Lord Jesus Christ requires listening to those He sends Following the prophet in a world of commotion is like being wrapped in a soothing warm blanket on a freezing cold day We live in a world of reason debate argument logic and explanation Questioning Why is positive in so many aspects of our lives allowing the power of our intellect to guide a multitude of choices and decisions we face each day But the Lord s voice often comes without explanation 13 Long before academics studied the impact of infidelity upon trusting spouses and children the Lord declared Thou shalt not commit adultery 14 Beyond relying on the intellect alone we treasure the gift of the Holy Ghost Don t Be SurprisedThe prophet s voice while spoken kindly will often be a voice asking us to change to repent and to return to the Lord When correction is needed let s not delay And don t be alarmed when the prophet s warning voice counters popular opinions of the day The mocking fireballs of annoyed disbelievers are always hurled the moment the prophet begins to speak As you are humble in following the counsel of the Lord s prophet I promise you an added blessing of safety and peace Don t be surprised if at times your personal views are not initially in harmony with the teachings of the Lord s prophet These are moments of learning of humility when we go to our knees in prayer We walk forward in faith trusting in God knowing that with time we will receive more spiritual clarity from our Heavenly Father One prophet described the incomparable gift of the Savior as the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father 15 The surrender of our will to God s will is in fact not surrender at all but the beginning of a glorious victory Some will try to overly dissect the prophet s words struggling to determine what is his prophetic voice and what is his personal opinion In 1982 two years before being called as a General Authority Brother Russell M Nelson said I never ask myself When does the prophet speak as a prophet and when does he not My interest has been How can I be more like him And he added My philosophy is to stop putting question marks behind the prophet s statements and put exclamation points instead 16 This is how a humble and spiritual man chose to order his life Now 36 years later he is the Lord s prophet Increasing Your Faith in the SaviorIn my personal life I have found that as I prayerfully study the words of the prophet of God and carefully with patience spiritually align my will with his inspired teachings my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ always increases 17 If we choose to set his counsel aside and determine that we know better our faith suffers and our eternal perspective is clouded I promise you that as you remain resolute in following the prophet your faith in the Savior will increase The Savior said All the prophets have testified of me 18A prophet does not stand between you and the Savior Rather he stands beside you and points the way to the Savior A prophet s greatest responsibility and most precious gift to us is his sure witness his certain knowledge that Jesus is the Christ Like Peter of old our prophet declares He is the Christ the Son of the living God 19In a future day looking back on our mortality we will rejoice that we walked the earth at the time of a living prophet At that day I pray that we will be able to say We listened to him We believed him We studied his words with patience and faith We prayed for him We stood by him We were humble enough to follow him We loved him I give you my solemn witness that Jesus is the Christ our Savior and Redeemer and that President Russell M Nelson is His anointed prophet upon the earth In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
First a kind word for the little children Yes this is the last session and yes I am the final speaker Recently while visiting the Provo City Center Temple I admired a painting entitled First Vision from Afar The painting depicts the light and power from heaven as the Father and Son visited the young Joseph Smith While not making a comparison with the very sacred event that ushered in the Restoration I can imagine a similar visual that would reflect the light and spiritual power of God descending upon this general conference and in turn that power and light moving across the world I give you my witness that Jesus is the Christ that He guides the affairs of this sacred work and that general conference is one of the very important times He gives direction to His Church and to us personally Being Taught from on HighOn the day the Church was organized the Lord designated Joseph Smith a prophet seer and apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ1 and said to the Church For his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you and cause the heavens to shake for your good 2Later all members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were also sustained and ordained as prophets seers and revelators 3Now as we meet under the direction of President Thomas S Monson we anticipate hearing the will of the Lord the mind of the Lord the voice of the Lord and the power of God unto salvation 4 We trust in His promise Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same 5In the commotion and confusion of our modern world trusting and believing in the words of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve is vital to our spiritual growth and endurance 6We have come together for this wonderful conference Millions of Latter day Saints and others of faith in more than 200 countries speaking more than 93 languages attend these sessions or read the conference messages We come having prayed and prepared For many of us there are pressing worries and earnest questions We want to renew our faith in our Savior Jesus Christ and to strengthen our ability to resist temptation and avoid distractions We come to be taught from on high The Mind and Will of the LordFor the First Presidency and the Twelve who normally speak each conference the enormous responsibility of preparing their messages is both a recurring burden and a sacred trust Years ago before serving as a General Authority I asked Elder Dallin H Oaks if he prepared a separate talk for each stake conference He responded that he did not but added But my general conference talks are different I may go through 12 to 15 drafts to be sure that I say what the Lord would have me say 7When and how does the inspiration for general conference talks come With no topics assigned we see heaven beautifully coordinating the subjects and themes of eternal truth each and every conference One of my Brethren told me that his subject for this conference was given to him immediately after his talk last April Another mentioned three weeks ago that he was still praying and waiting upon the Lord Another when asked how long it had taken to compose an especially sensitive talk responded Twenty five years At times the central idea may come quickly but the content and details still require enormous spiritual climbing Fasting and prayer study and faith are always part of the process The Lord wants no pretense diminishing His voice to His Saints Direction for a general conference talk often comes in the night or the early morning hours when the talk is far from the thoughts of the mind Suddenly unanticipated insight and at times specific words and phrases flow as pure revelation 8As you listen the messages you receive may be very literal or they may be customized just for you Speaking many years ago in general conference I told of a phrase that entered my mind as I wondered if I was prepared to serve a mission The phrase was You don t know everything but you know enough 9 A young woman sitting in general conference that day told me that she was praying over a proposal for marriage wondering how well she knew the young man When I spoke the words You don t know everything but you know enough the Spirit confirmed to her that she did know him well enough They have been happily married for many years I promise you that as you prepare your spirit and come with the anticipation that you will hear the voice of the Lord thoughts and feelings will come into your mind that are customized especially for you You have already felt them in this conference or you will as you study the messages in the weeks ahead For Now and the Months AheadPresident Monson has said Take the time to read the conference messages 10 Ponder them I have found that I gain even more from these inspired sermons when I study them in greater depth 11The teachings of general conference are the considerations the Lord would have before us now and in the months ahead The shepherd goeth before his sheep and the sheep follow him for they know his voice 12Often His voice directs us to change something in our lives He invites us to repent He invites us to follow Him Think about these statements from this conference President Henry B Eyring from this morning I bear my witness that God the Father lives and wants you to come home to Him This is the true Church of the Lord Jesus Christ He knows you He loves you He watches over you 13President Dieter F Uchtdorf from yesterday I testify that when we embark upon or continue the incredible journey that leads to God our lives will be better and the Lord will use us in remarkable ways to bless those around us and bring about His eternal purposes 14President Russell M Nelson from yesterday afternoon I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon you can be immunized against the evils of the day even the gripping plague of pornography and other mind numbing addictions 15Elder Dallin H Oaks yesterday I testify that the proclamation on the family is a statement of eternal truth the will of the Lord for His children who seek eternal life 16And Elder M Russell Ballard from just a few minutes ago We need to embrace God s children compassionately and eliminate any prejudice including racism sexism and nationalism 17Because we have an extra minute I would like to just add a brief reflection about Elder Robert D Hales The First Presidency had told Elder Hales that he could give a brief message in the Sunday morning session if his health permitted it While his health did not permit it he prepared a message which he finished last week and shared with me Given his passing approximately three hours ago I share just three lines from his talk Quoting Elder Hales When we choose to have faith we are prepared to stand in the presence of God After the Savior s Crucifixion He appeared only to those who had been faithful in the testimony of Him while they lived in mortality D C 138 12 Those who rejected the testimonies of the prophets could not behold the Savior s presence nor look upon his face D C 138 21 Our faith prepares us to be in the presence of the Lord How kind of the Lord to impress upon President Russell M Nelson right at the end of this morning s session to quickly leave the building skip his lunch and hurry to the bedside of Elder Hales where he could arrive and be there his quorum president with the angelic Mary Hales as Elder Hales graduated from mortality Responding to the Voice of the LordI testify that in this conference we have heard the voice of the Lord We should not be alarmed when the words of the Lord s servants run counter to the thinking of the world and at times our own thinking It has always been this way I am on my knees in the temple with my Brethren I attest to the goodness of their souls Their greatest desire is to please the Lord and help God s children return to His presence The Seventy the Bishopric the General Presidencies of the Relief Society the Young Women and the Primary and other auxiliary leaders have added tremendous inspiration to this conference as have the beautiful music and the thoughtful prayers There is a treasure chest of heavenly direction awaiting your discovery in the messages of general conference The test for each of us is how we respond to what we hear what we read and what we feel Let me share an experience about responding to prophetic words from the life of President Russell M Nelson In 1979 five years before his call as a General Authority Brother Nelson attended a meeting just prior to general conference President Spencer W Kimball challenged all present to lengthen their stride in taking the gospel to the entire world Among the countries President Kimball specifically mentioned was China declaring We should be of service to the Chinese We should learn their language We should pray for them and help them 18At age 54 Brother Nelson had a feeling during the meeting that he should study the Mandarin language Although a busy heart surgeon he immediately secured the services of a tutor Not long after beginning his studies Dr Nelson attending a convention unexpectedly found himself sitting next to a distinguished Chinese surgeon Dr Wu Yingkai Because Brother Nelson had been studying Mandarin he began a conversation with Dr Wu 19Dr Nelson s desire to follow the prophet led to Dr Wu visiting Salt Lake City and Dr Nelson traveling to China to give lectures and perform surgical operations His love for the Chinese people and their love and respect for him grew In February 1985 ten months after his call to the Quorum of the Twelve Elder Nelson received a surprise phone call from China pleading for Dr Nelson to come to Beijing to operate on the failing heart of China s most famous opera singer With the encouragement of President Gordon B Hinckley Elder Nelson returned to China The last surgical operation he ever performed was in the People s Republic of China Just two years ago in October 2015 President Russell M Nelson was once again honored with an official declaration naming him an old friend of China Then yesterday we heard the now 93 year old President Russell M Nelson speak of President Thomas S Monson s plea to each of us in last April s conference to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of Mormon each day Just like he did as a busy heart surgeon when he hired a Mandarin tutor President Nelson immediately took the counsel of President Monson and applied it to his own life More than just reading he said that he made lists of what the Book of Mormon is what it affirms what it refutes what it fulfills what it clarifies and what it reveals 20And then interestingly just this morning as a second witness President Henry B Eyring also spoke of his response to President Monson s admonition Do you remember these words Like many of you I heard the prophet s words as the voice of the Lord to me And also like many of you I decided to obey those words 21May we see these as examples for our own lives A Promise and a BlessingI promise that as you hear the voice of the Lord to you in the teachings of this general conference and then act on those promptings you will feel heaven s hand upon you and your life and the lives of those around you will be blessed 22During this conference we have thought of our dear prophet We love you President Monson I close with his words given from this pulpit I believe it is a blessing that he would want to give to each of us today were he able to be with us He said As we leave this conference I invoke the blessings of heaven upon each of you I pray our Heavenly Father will bless you and your families May the messages and spirit of this conference find expression in all that you do in your homes in your work in your meetings and in all your comings and goings He concluded I love you I pray for you May God bless you May His promised peace be with you now and always 23In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Many years ago President David O McKay told of a beautiful experience he had while sailing on a boat toward Samoa After falling asleep he beheld in vision something infinitely sublime In the distance he said I beheld a beautiful white city Trees with luscious fruit and flowers in perfect bloom abounded everywhere A great concourse of people was approaching the city Each one wore a white flowing robe Instantly my attention centered upon their leader and though I could see only the profile of his features I recognized him at once as my Savior The radiance of his countenance was glorious The peace about him was divine President McKay continues The city was his the City Eternal and the people following him were to abide there in peace and eternal happiness President McKay wondered Who are they Who are these people He explains what happened next As if the Savior read my thoughts he answered by pointing to words in a semicircle that appeared above the people written in gold These Are They Who Have Overcome the World Who Have Truly Been Born Again 1For decades I have remembered the words These are they who have overcome the world The blessings that the Lord has promised to those who overcome the world are breathtaking They will be clothed in white and named in the book of life The Lord will confess their names before the Father and before his angels 2 Each shall have part in the first resurrection 3 receive eternal life 4 and go no more out 5 from the presence of God Is it possible to overcome the world and receive these blessings Yes it is Love for the SaviorThose who overcome the world develop an all encompassing love for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ His divine birth His perfect life His infinite Atonement at Gethsemane and Golgotha assured the Resurrection of each of us And with our sincere repentance He alone is able to cleanse us from our sins allowing us to return to the presence of God We love him because he first loved us 6Jesus said Be of good cheer I have overcome the world 7Later He added I will that ye should overcome the world 8Overcoming the world is not one defining moment in a lifetime but a lifetime of moments that define an eternity It can begin as a child learns to pray and reverently sings I m trying to be like Jesus 9 It continues as a person studies the life of the Savior in the New Testament and ponders the power of the Savior s Atonement in the Book of Mormon Praying repenting following the Savior and receiving His grace lead us to better understand why we are here and who we are to become Alma described it this way A mighty change is wrought in their hearts and they humble themselves and put their trust in the true and living God remaining faithful until the end 10Those overcoming the world know that they will be accountable to their Heavenly Father Sincerely changing and repenting of sins is no longer restraining but liberating as sins of scarlet become white as snow 11Accountability to GodThose of the world have difficulty with accountability to God like a child who parties in his parents home while they are out of town enjoying the ruckus refusing to think about the consequences when the parents return 24 hours later The world is more interested in indulging the natural man than in subduing him Overcoming the world is not a global invasion but a private personal battle requiring hand to hand combat with our own internal foes Overcoming the world means treasuring the greatest commandment Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength 12The Christian writer C S Lewis described it this way Christ says Give me All I don t want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work I want You 13Overcoming the world is keeping our promises to God our baptismal and temple covenants and our oath of faithfulness to our eternal companion Overcoming the world leads us humbly to the sacrament table each week asking for forgiveness and pledging to remember him and keep his commandments that we may always have his Spirit to be with us 14Our love for the Sabbath day does not end when the chapel doors close behind us but instead opens the doors to a beautiful day of resting from routine tasks studying praying and reaching out to family and others who need our attention Instead of breathing a sigh of relief when church is over and frantically running in search of a television before the football game begins let our focus remain on the Savior and upon His holy day The world is incessantly pulled by a flood of enticing and seductive voices 15Overcoming the world is trusting in the one voice that warns comforts enlightens and brings peace not as the world giveth 16UnselfishnessOvercoming the world means turning ourselves outward remembering the second commandment17 He that is greatest among you shall be your servant 18 The happiness of our spouse is more important than our own pleasure Helping our children to love God and keep His commandments is a primary priority We willingly share our material blessings through tithing fast offerings and giving to those in need And as our spiritual antennas are pointed heavenward the Lord guides us to those we can help The world builds its universe around itself proudly proclaiming Look at me compared to my neighbor Look at what is mine See how important I am The world is easily irritated disinterested and demanding loving the cheers of the crowd while overcoming the world brings humility empathy patience and compassion for those different than yourself Safety in the ProphetsOvercoming the world will always mean that we will have some beliefs that are ridiculed by the world The Savior said If the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you If ye were of the world the world would love his own 19President Russell M Nelson said this morning True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out speak up and be different from the people of the world 20A disciple of Christ is not alarmed if a post about her faith does not receive 1 000 likes or even a few friendly emojis Overcoming the world is being less concerned with our online connections and more concerned with our heavenly connection to God The Lord gives us safety as we heed the guidance from His living prophets and apostles President Thomas S Monson has said The world can be challenging As we go to the temple we will be more able to bear every trial and to overcome each temptation We will be renewed and fortified 21With increasing temptations distractions and distortions the world attempts to beguile the faithful into dismissing the rich spiritual experiences of one s past redefining them as foolish deceptions Overcoming the world is remembering even when we are discouraged the times we have felt the love and light of the Savior Elder Neal A Maxwell explained one of these experiences this way I had been blessed and I knew that God knew that I knew I had been blessed 22 Although we may temporarily feel forgotten we do not forget Overcoming the world does not mean we live a cloistered life protected from the unfairness and difficulties of mortality Rather it opens the more expansive view of faith drawing us to the Savior and His promises While perfection is not complete in this life overcoming the world keeps our hope aflame that one day we shall stand before our Redeemer and see his face with pleasure 23 and hear His voice Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you 24The Example of Elder Bruce D PorterOn December 28 of this past year our dear friend and beloved General Authority Elder Bruce D Porter completed his mortality He was 64 years old I first met Bruce when we were students at Brigham Young University He was one of the best and the brightest After he received his doctoral degree from Harvard University emphasizing Russian affairs Bruce s thinking and writing brought prominence that could have derailed him but the wealth and praise of the world never clouded his view 25 His loyalty was to his Savior Jesus Christ to his eternal companion Susan to his children and grandchildren Bruce was born with a kidney defect He had surgery but over time his kidneys continued to decline Shortly after Bruce s call as a General Authority in 1995 we served together with our families in Frankfurt Germany where his work centered in Russia and Eastern Europe Life for Elder Porter changed dramatically in 1997 when his kidney function and health began to fail The Porter family returned to Salt Lake City During his 22 years of service in the Seventy Bruce was hospitalized numerous times including for 10 surgeries Doctors told Susan on two occasions that Bruce would not live through the night but he did For more than 12 years of his service as a General Authority Bruce was on dialysis to clean his blood For much of that time the dialysis consumed five evenings a week for four hours each treatment so that he could serve in his calling during the day and accept conference assignments on the weekends When his health did not improve after several priesthood blessings Bruce was puzzled but he knew in whom he trusted 26In 2010 Bruce received a kidney from his son David This time his body did not reject the transplant It was a miracle bringing renewed health and eventually allowing him and Susan to return to their beloved Russia with him serving in the Area Presidency On December 26 of last year after fighting continuous infections in a hospital in Salt Lake City he asked the doctors to leave the room Bruce told Susan that he knew through the Spirit that there was nothing the doctors could do that would save his life He knew that Heavenly Father would take him home He was filled with peace 27On December 28 Bruce returned to his family home A few hours later surrounded by loved ones he peacefully returned to his heavenly home Years ago Bruce Porter wrote these words to his children The testimony I have of the reality and love of Jesus Christ has been the compass of my life It is a pure burning witness of the Spirit that he lives that he is my Redeemer and Friend in every time of need 28 Our challenge is to come to know the Savior and through faith in him to overcome the trials and temptations of this world 29 Let us be faithful and true trusting in him 30Bruce Douglas Porter overcame the world May we each try a little harder in our efforts to overcome the world not excusing serious offenses yet being patient with minor slips and falls eagerly hastening our speed and generously helping others As you trust more fully in the Savior I promise you blessings of greater peace in this life and a greater assurance of your eternal destiny in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Much of the important work of God is unseen in the eyes of the world The sixth century before Christ brought illustrious thinkers such as Confucius in China and Buddha in Eastern India but the power of God s priesthood was upon Daniel the prophet living in captivity during the reign of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar Troubled by a dream in the night King Nebuchadnezzar demanded that his magicians and sorcerers tell him both what he had dreamed and the interpretation of the dream Of course they could not tell the king what he had dreamed and they protested There is not a man upon the earth that can do this nor any king that would ask such things 1 King Nebuchadnezzar was furious with their failure and angrily declared that all his counselors would be slain Daniel one of the king s wise men prayed for the mercies of God concerning this secret 2A miracle occurred The secret of what the king had dreamed was revealed to Daniel Daniel was taken before the king Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen and the interpretation thereof Daniel responded The wise men the astrologers the magicians cannot tell you what you dreamed But there is a God in heaven that can reveal these things and He maketh known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days The God of heaven Daniel said shall set up a kingdom a stone cut out without hands that will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth never to be destroyed but to stand for ever The dream said Daniel is certain and the interpretation sure 3With his dream explained and interpreted the king spoke boldly Your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings 4From the miraculous intervention of God to Daniel came the prophesied future of the gospel of Jesus Christ being restored to the earth a kingdom that would fill the whole earth never to be destroyed but to stand for ever The number of members of the Church in the latter days would be relatively few as Nephi prophesied but they would be upon all the face of the earth and the power and ordinances of the priesthood would be available to all who desired them filling the earth as Daniel foretold 5In 1831 the Prophet Joseph Smith received this revelation The keys of the kingdom of God and the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth are committed unto man on the earth and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth until it has filled the whole earth 6A Responsibility We ShareThe gathering of Israel is a miracle It is like an enormous puzzle whose pieces will be set in place prior to the glorious events of the Second Coming Just as we might be perplexed with a mountain of puzzle pieces the early Saints must have seen the commission to take the restored gospel to all the world as a nearly impossible task But they began one person one puzzle piece at a time finding the straight edges working to rightly frame this divine work Little by little the stone cut without hands began to roll forth from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands and now millions of covenant Latter day Saints across every nation are connecting the puzzle pieces of this marvelous work and a wonder Each of us is a piece of the puzzle and each of us helps to set in place other essential pieces You are important to this great cause Our view ahead is now clear We can see the miracle continuing and the Lord s hand guiding us as we complete the gaps that remain Then the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done 7 and He will return in majesty and glory President Thomas S Monson has said Now is the time for members and missionaries to come together to work together to bring souls unto Him He will assist us in our labors if we will act in faith to fulfill His work 8The divinely appointed responsibility that once rested primarily upon the shoulders of full time missionaries now rests upon us all We all want to share the restored gospel and gratefully thousands are baptized each week But even with this wonderful blessing our concern for our brothers and sisters and our desire to please God bring a compelling urgency to share and strengthen the kingdom of God across the world The Limits of GuiltEven with a strong desire to share the gospel you may be less than happy with the success of your past efforts You may feel like a friend who said I have talked to our family and friends about the Church but few have shown any interest and with each rejection I have become more hesitant I know I should do more but I am stuck and all I feel is enormous guilt Let me see if I can help Guilt has an important role as it awakens us to changes we need to make but there are limits to how far guilt will help us Guilt is like a battery in a gasoline powered car It can light up the car start the engine and power the headlights but it will not provide the fuel for the long journey ahead The battery by itself is not sufficient And neither is guilt I suggest that you stop feeling guilty about any insufficiency you think you have in sharing the gospel Rather pray like Alma taught for opportunities to stand as a witness of God at all times and in all things and in all places that others may be redeemed of God and be numbered with those of the first resurrection and have eternal life 9 This is a much stronger motivation than guilt To be a witness of God at all times and in all places reflects both how we live and how we speak Be open about your faith in Christ When the occasion presents itself speak of His life His teachings and His incomparable gift to all mankind Share His powerful truths from the Book of Mormon He has given us this promise Whosoever shall confess me before men him will I confess before my Father in heaven 10 I promise you that as you pray often and sincerely for opportunities to stand as a witness of God those opportunities will come and those who seek more light and knowledge will be put before you As you respond to spiritual promptings the Holy Ghost will carry your words to the heart of another and one day the Savior will confess you before His Father A Group EffortThe spiritual work of helping someone come into the kingdom of God is a group effort Enlist the missionaries as soon as you can and pray for heavenly help But remember the timing of another s conversion is not fully up to you 11Kamla Persand was from the Mauritius island attending medical school in Bordeaux France when we met her in February of 1991 We had prayed as a family to be able to share the gospel with someone who was seeking the truth and we taught her in our home I was privileged to perform her baptism but we were not the most significant influences in Kamla joining the Church Friends missionaries and even family members had been witnesses of God in her home country and one day in France when the time was right for Kamla she made the decision to be baptized Now 25 years later the blessings of that decision are all around her and her son is a missionary in Madagascar Please don t see your efforts to share the love of the Savior with another as a pass fail test with your grade determined by how positively your friends respond to your feelings or invitation to meet the missionaries 12 With our mortal eyes we cannot judge the effect of our efforts nor can we establish the timetable When you share the love of the Savior with another your grade is always an A Some governments have restricted the work of missionaries leading our noble members to show even greater courage in being witnesses of God at all times and in all places Nadezhda from Moscow often gives others a copy of the Book of Mormon in a gift box with lots of candy packed around it I tell them she said that it is the sweetest gift I could possibly give them Shortly after being baptized in Ukraine Svetlana had the impression to share the gospel with a man she frequently saw on the bus When the man got off at his stop she asked Would you like to know more about God The man said Yes Missionaries taught Viktor and he was baptized He and Svetlana were later sealed in the Freiberg Germany Temple Be careful your blessings may come in unexpected ways Seven years ago Kathy and I met Diego Gomez and his beautiful family in Salt Lake City They attended a temple open house with us but graciously declined our invitation to learn more about the Church This past May I received a surprising telephone call from Diego Events in his life had led him to his knees He had found the missionaries on his own taken the discussions and was ready for baptism This past June 11 I walked into the waters of baptism with my friend and fellow disciple Diego Gomez His conversion had its own timetable and came with the help and support of many who reached out to him as witnesses of God An Invitation to the YouthTo our amazing youth and young adults across the world I give a special invitation and challenge to be witnesses of God Those who surround you are open to spiritual inquiry Remember the puzzle You do not come to the table with empty hands but with technology and social media at your command We need you the Lord needs you to be even more engaged in this great cause The Savior said Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost 13It is not by chance that you live in Africa Asia Europe North Central or South America the Pacific or another place in God s world because the gospel must go to every nation kindred tongue and people 14 The God of heaven has set up a kingdom a stone cut out without hands that has become a great mountain and is filling the whole earth never to be destroyed but to stand for ever The dream is certain and the interpretation sure 15I close with words from the Doctrine and Covenants Call upon the Lord that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth that the inhabitants thereof may receive it and be prepared for the days to come in the which the Son of Man shall come down from heaven clothed in the brightness of his glory to meet the kingdom of God on the earth 16 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
God loves children He loves all children The Savior said Suffer the little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven 1Children today find themselves in many different and complex family configurations For example today twice as many children in the United States are living with only one parent than were 50 years ago 2 And there are many families that are less unified in their love of God and willingness to keep His commandments In this increasing spiritual commotion the restored gospel will continue to carry the standard the ideal the pattern of the Lord Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs and to teach them to love and serve one another and observe the commandments of God 3We recognize the many good parents across the world of all faiths who lovingly care for their children And we gratefully acknowledge the families in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints who are wrapped in the care of a father and mother converted to the Savior who are sealed by the authority of the priesthood and who are learning in their family to love and trust their Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ Plea for the YouthBut my plea today is for the hundreds of thousands of children youth and young adults who do not come from these for lack of a better term picture perfect families I speak not only of the youth who have experienced the death divorce or diminishing faith of their parents but also of the tens of thousands of young men and young women from all around the world who embrace the gospel without a mother or father to come into the Church with them 4These young Latter day Saints enter the Church with great faith They hope to create the family ideal in their own lives at a future day 5 In time they become an important part of our missionary force our righteous young adults and those who kneel at an altar to begin their own families SensitivityWe will continue to teach the Lord s pattern for families but now with millions of members and the diversity we have in the children of the Church we need to be even more thoughtful and sensitive Our Church culture and vernacular are at times quite unique The Primary children are not going to stop singing Families Can Be Together Forever 6 but when they sing I m so glad when daddy comes home 7 or with father and mother leading the way 8 not all children will be singing about their own family Our friend Bette shared an experience she had at church when she was 10 years old She said Our teacher was sharing a lesson about temple marriage She specifically asked me Bette your parents weren t married in the temple were they My teacher and the rest of the class knew the answer The teacher s lesson followed and Bette imagined the worst Bette said I had many tearful nights When I had heart problems two years later and thought I was going to die I panicked thinking I would be alone forever My friend Leif attended church by himself Once while in Primary he was asked to give a short talk He had no mom or dad at church to stand beside him and help him if he forgot what to say Leif was terrified Rather than embarrass himself he just stayed away from church for several months Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them And said whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me 9Believing Hearts and Spiritual GiftsThese children and youth are blessed with believing hearts and spiritual gifts Leif told me I knew deep in the recesses of my mind that God was my Father and that He knew me and loved me Our friend Veronique said As I learned the principles of the gospel and studied the Book of Mormon it was as though I was remembering things that I had already known but had forgotten Our friend Zuleika comes from Alegrete Brazil Although her family was not religious at age 12 Zuleika began to read the Bible and visit local churches searching to know more about God With her parents reluctant permission she studied with the missionaries gained a testimony and was baptized Zuleika told me During the discussions I was shown a picture of the Salt Lake Temple and told about the sealing ordinances From that moment I had the desire of one day entering into the house of the Lord and having an eternal family While a child s earthly situation may not be ideal a child s spiritual DNA is perfect because one s true identity is as a son or daughter of God President Thomas S Monson has said Help God s children understand what is genuine and important in this life Help them develop the strength to choose paths that will keep them safely on the way to eternal life 10 Let s open our arms and our hearts a little wider These youth need our time and our testimonies Brandon who joined the Church in Colorado in high school spoke to me of those who reached out to him both before and after his baptism He said I was in the homes of families that lived the gospel It showed me a standard that I felt I could have in my own family Veronique born in the Netherlands attended school with our daughter Kristen when we lived in Germany Veronique noted Students who were Church members had a light about them I came to realize that that light came from their faith in Jesus Christ and living His teachings My friend Max was baptized when he was eight years old His father was not a member of any church and Max could go to church or not go As a teenager after not attending for several months Max had the feeling that he needed to go back to church and determined one Sunday morning that he would return But his resolve weakened as he approached the front door of the church his stomach tightened There standing at the door was the new bishop Max didn t know him and he felt sure the bishop didn t know Max As Max approached the bishop s face lit up and he put his hand out and said Max it s so good to see you As he spoke those words Max said a warm feeling came over me and I knew I had done the right thing 11Knowing someone s name can make a difference And Jesus commanded that their little children should be brought to him And he took them one by one and blessed them and prayed unto the Father for them And when he had done this he wept 12Youth Not Yet BaptizedAt the request of parents many youth who love the gospel wait years to be baptized Emily s parents divorced while she was a child and she did not receive permission to be baptized until she was 15 Our friend Emily speaks glowingly of a Young Women leader who always reached out and helped strengthen her testimony 13Colten and Preston are teenagers who live in Utah Their parents are divorced and they have not received permission to be baptized Even though they can t pass the sacrament they bring the bread each week And even though they can t enter the temple to do baptisms with the youth when their ward goes to the temple the two brothers find family names next door at the family history center The greatest influence on helping our youth feel included is other righteous youth Elder Joseph SsengoobaI close with the example of a new friend someone we met a few weeks ago while visiting the Zambia Lusaka Mission Elder Joseph Ssengooba is from Uganda His father died when he was seven At age nine with his mother and relatives unable to care for him he was on his own At age 12 he met the missionaries and was baptized Joseph told me of his first day at church After sacrament meeting I thought it was time to go home but the missionaries introduced me to Joshua Walusimbi Joshua told me that he was going to be my friend and he handed me a Children s Songbook so I wouldn t have to go into Primary empty handed In Primary Joshua put an extra chair right next to his The Primary president invited me to the front and asked the whole Primary to sing for me I Am a Child of God I felt very special The branch president took Joseph to the Pierre Mungoza family and that became his home for the next four years Eight years later when Elder Joseph Ssengooba began his mission to his great surprise his trainer was Elder Joshua Walusimbi the boy who had made him feel so welcome on his first day in Primary And his mission president He is President Leif Erickson the little boy who stayed away from Primary because he was terrified about giving a talk God loves His children The Children Came RunningWhen my wife Kathy and I were in Africa a few weeks ago we visited Mbuji Mayi Democratic Republic of the Congo Because the chapel was not large enough for the 2 000 members we met out of doors under large plastic coverings supported by bamboo poles As the meeting began we could see dozens of children watching us clinging to the bars on the outside of the wrought iron fence that surrounded the property Kathy quietly whispered Neil do you think that you might want to invite the children to come in I approached District President Kalonji at the podium and asked him if he would welcome the children outside the fence to come join us inside To my surprise with President Kalonji s invitation the children not only came but came running more than 50 perhaps 100 some with tattered clothes and bare feet but all with beautiful smiles and excited faces I was deeply moved by this experience and saw it as symbolic of our need to reach out to the youth who feel alone left behind or outside the fence Let us think about them welcome them embrace them and do everything we can to strengthen their love for the Savior Jesus said Whoso shall receive one such child in my name receiveth me 14 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Savior perceived the strength or weakness in the faith of those around Him To one He said approvingly Great is thy faith 1 He lamented to another O ye of little faith 2 He questioned others Where is your faith 3 And Jesus distinguished yet another with In all Israel I have not found so great faith 4I ask myself How does the Savior see my faith And tonight I ask you How does the Savior see your faith Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is not something ethereal floating loosely in the air Faith does not fall upon us by chance or stay with us by birthright It is as the scriptures say substance the evidence of things not seen 5 Faith emits a spiritual light and that light is discernible 6 Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from heaven that comes as we choose to believe7 and as we seek it and hold on to it Your faith is either growing stronger or becoming weaker Faith is a principle of power important not only in this life but also in our progression beyond the veil 8 By the grace of Christ we will one day be saved through faith on His name 9 The future of your faith is not by chance but by choice The Faith of a Young BrazilianA month ago in Brazil I met Aroldo Cavalcante He was baptized at age 21 the first member of the Church in his family His faith burned brightly and he immediately began preparing to serve a mission Sadly Aroldo s mother was diagnosed with cancer Three months later only days before she died she spoke to Aroldo of her greatest concern There were no relatives to help Aroldo would need to take full responsibility for his two younger sisters and his younger brother He solemnly made this promise to his dying mother By day he worked in a bank and at night he attended the university He continued to keep his baptismal covenants but his hopes for a full time mission were gone His mission would be caring for his family Months later while preparing a sacrament meeting talk Aroldo studied the words that Samuel reprovingly spoke to King Saul To obey he read is better than to sacrifice 10 Aroldo received the seemingly impossible impression that he needed to obey the prophet s call to serve a mission Undaunted by the obstacles before him he moved forward with enormous faith Aroldo saved every Brazilian cruzeiro he could At age 23 he received his mission call He told his brother how much to withdraw each month from his account for the family Aroldo still did not have enough money to pay the full cost of his mission and the living expenses for his brother and sisters but with faith he entered the MTC A week later he received the first of many blessings The bank that had employed Elder Cavalcante unexpectedly doubled the money he was to receive as he concluded his work This miracle along with others provided the needed income for his mission and his family during his absence Twenty years later Brother Cavalcante is now serving as the president of the Recife Brazil Boa Viagem Stake Looking back he said of those days As I tried to live righteously I felt the Savior s love and guidance My faith grew allowing me to overcome many challenges 11 Aroldo s faith did not come by chance but by choice There are many Christian men and women with deep faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and we honor and respect them No Longer on Neutral GroundBut brethren we have been given something more the priesthood of God the power of God restored to earth by holy angels This makes you different You no longer stand on neutral ground Your faith will grow not by chance but by choice How we live our lives increases or diminishes our faith Prayer obedience honesty purity of thought and deed and unselfishness increase faith Without these faith diminishes Why did the Savior say to Peter I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not 12 Because there is an adversary who delights in destroying our faith Be relentless in protecting your faith Honest QuestionsAddressing honest questions is an important part of building faith and we use both our intellect and our feelings The Lord said I will tell you in your mind and in your heart 13 Not all answers will come immediately but most questions can be resolved through sincere study and seeking answers from God Using our mind without our heart will not bring spiritual answers The things of God knoweth no man but through the Spirit of God 14 And to help us Jesus promised us another Comforter and called Him even the Spirit of truth 15Faith never demands an answer to every question but seeks the assurance and courage to move forward sometimes acknowledging I don t know everything but I do know enough to continue on the path of discipleship 16Immersing oneself in persistent doubt fueled by answers from the faithless and the unfaithful weakens one s faith in Jesus Christ and the Restoration 17 The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him 18For example questions concerning the Prophet Joseph Smith are not new They have been hurled by his critics since this work began To those of faith who looking through the colored glasses of the 21st century honestly question events or statements of the Prophet Joseph from nearly 200 years ago may I share some friendly advice For now give Brother Joseph a break In a future day you will have 100 times more information than from all of today s search engines combined and it will come from our all knowing Father in Heaven 19 Consider the totality of Joseph s life born in poverty and given little formal education he translated the Book of Mormon in less than 90 days 20 Tens of thousands of honest devoted men and women embraced the cause of the Restoration At age 38 Joseph sealed his witness with his blood I testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God Settle this in your mind and move forward Gifts That Enlarge Our FaithBoth the Bible and the Book of Mormon give us the beautiful assurance that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God I hold in my hand a copy of the first edition of the Book of Mormon in French published by John Taylor as he began the work in France in 1852 Some or all of the Book of Mormon is now in 110 languages across the world It provides a spiritual and tangible witness of the truthfulness of the Restoration When was the last time that you read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover Read it again It will increase your faith 21Another gift from God that enlarges our faith is the guidance of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Today we sustained three new members of the Twelve and I welcome Elder Rasband Elder Stevenson and Elder Renlund to the sacred circle of the Quorum of the Twelve Paul said He called apostles and prophets For the perfecting of the saints Till we all come in unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God No more tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the cunning craftiness of those who lie in wait to deceive 22The guidance of the First Presidency and the Twelve help protect our faith Although your beginning fire of faith may be small righteous choices bring greater confidence in God and your faith grows The difficulties of mortality blow against you and evil forces lurk in the darkness hoping to extinguish your faith But as you continue to make good choices trust in God and follow His Son the Lord sends increased light and knowledge and your faith becomes settled and unwavering President Thomas S Monson said Fear not The future is as bright as your faith 23Porter Zane and Max OpenshawThe faith of the young men of this Church is remarkable On June 12 of this year I received an email telling me that the bishop from a Utah ward his wife and two of their children had been killed in an airplane accident Bishop Mark Openshaw had been piloting the plane as it left a small airfield when it suddenly fell from the sky and crashed to the earth Bishop Openshaw his wife Amy and their children Tanner and Ellie were killed in the accident Miraculously their five year old son Max thrown out of the airplane in his airplane seat escaped with only broken bones I learned that their son Elder Porter Openshaw was serving in the Marshall Islands Majuro Mission and that their 17 year old son Zane was on a school cultural exchange in Germany I called Elder Openshaw on Christmas Island Although heartbroken by the unexpected death of his mother father brother and sister Elder Openshaw immediately turned his concern to his two younger brothers Ultimately it was Elder Openshaw and his brother Zane who decided that others could help at home and that Porter should stay on his mission They knew it was what their parents would want As I spoke with Elder Openshaw I felt his sadness but also his unquenchable fire of faith I have the confidence he told me and I know without a shadow of a doubt that I will see my family again Strength in our trials is always found in our Lord Jesus Christ God s omnipotent hand has been so apparent in helping me and my brothers throughout this very difficult challenge 24I met Zane for the first time at the funeral As I looked at the four caskets before us in the chapel I marveled at the faith of this 17 year old as he addressed the congregation Today he said we have gathered with humble hearts and weary souls to remember the lives of my mom dad Tanner and Ellie We have talked together cried together remembered together and felt the hand of God together The day after I heard the news of the accident I found a letter in my bag from my mom In the letter she wrote Zane remember who you are and where you come from We will be praying for you and missing you Zane continued There could not be more fitting last words from my mother I know that she along with Tanner Ellie and my dad are praying for my brothers and me I know that they pray that I remember who I am because I like you am a child of God and He has sent me here I testify that no matter how alone we feel God will not forsake us 25My dear friends your faith did not begin at birth and it will not end at death Faith is a choice Strengthen your faith and live to be deserving of the Savior s approving words Great is thy faith As you do I promise you that your faith through the grace of Jesus Christ will one day allow you to stand with those you love clean and pure in the presence of God in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As we were singing I was deeply moved with the thought that at this very moment hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of believing Saints in more than 150 countries amazingly in 75 different languages 1 together we were raising our voices to God singing Come O thou King of Kings We ve waited long for thee With healing in thy wings To set thy people free 2 Come O thou King of Kings 3 We are a very large worldwide family of believers disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ We have taken His name upon us and each week as we partake of the sacrament we pledge that we will remember Him and keep His commandments We are far from perfect but we are not casual in our faith We believe in Him We worship Him We follow Him We deeply love Him His cause is the greatest cause in all the world We live brothers and sisters in the days preceding the Lord s Second Coming a time long anticipated by believers through the ages We live in days of wars and rumors of wars days of natural disasters days when the world is pulled by confusion and commotion But we also live in the glorious time of the Restoration when the gospel is being taken to all the world a time when the Lord has promised that He will raise up a pure people 4 and arm them with righteousness and with the power of God 5We rejoice in these days and pray that we will be able to courageously face our struggles and uncertainties The difficulties of some are more severe than those of others but no one is immune Elder Neal A Maxwell once said to me If everything is going perfectly for you right now just wait Although the Lord reassures us again and again that we need not fear 6 keeping a clear perspective and seeing beyond this world is not always easy when we are in the midst of trials President Thomas S Monson taught me an important lesson about keeping an eternal point of view Eighteen years ago while traveling on a train in Switzerland with President Monson I asked him about his heavy responsibilities His response strengthened my faith In the First Presidency he said we do everything we can to move this work forward But this is the Lord s work and He directs it He is at the helm We marvel as we watch Him open doors we cannot open and perform miracles we can scarcely imagine 7Brothers and sisters seeing and believing the Lord s miracles in establishing His kingdom on earth can help us see and believe that the Lord s hand is at work in our own lives as well The Lord declared I am able to do mine own work 8 We each try to do our part but He is the grand architect Under the direction of His Father He created this world All things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made 9 As we are spiritually awake and alert we see His hand across the world and we see His hand in our own personal lives Let me share an example In 1831 with only 600 members of the Church the Lord declared The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth until it has filled the whole earth 10The prophet Nephi foresaw that in our day there would be few members of the Church when compared to the population of the earth but that they would be upon all the face of the earth 11Three beautiful examples of the Lord s hand in establishing His kingdom are the temples announced today by President Monson Only a few decades ago who could have imagined temples in Haiti Thailand and the Ivory Coast The location of a temple is not a convenient geographical decision It comes by revelation from the Lord to His prophet signifying a great work to be done and acknowledging the righteousness of the Saints who will treasure and care for His house through generations 12My wife Kathy and I visited Haiti just two years ago High on the mountain overlooking Port au Prince we joined with Haitian Saints in commemorating the dedication of the country by then Elder Thomas S Monson only 30 years earlier None of us will ever forget the devastating Haitian earthquake of 2010 With faithful members and a courageous band of missionaries made up almost exclusively of Haitians the Church in this island nation has continued to grow and strengthen It lifts my faith to visualize these righteous Saints of God clothed in white having the power of the holy priesthood to direct and perform the sacred ordinances in the Lord s house Who could imagine a house of the Lord in the beautiful city of Bangkok Christians are only 1 percent of this principally Buddhist country As in Haiti we also find in Bangkok that the Lord has gathered the elect of the earth While there a few months ago we met Sathit and Juthamas Kaivaivatana and their devoted children Sathit joined the Church when he was 17 and served a mission in his native land Later he met Juthamas at the institute and they were sealed in the Manila Philippines Temple In 1993 the Kaivaivatanas were hit by a truck whose driver had fallen asleep and Sathit was paralyzed from his chest down Their faith has never wavered Sathit is an admired teacher at the International School Bangkok He serves as the stake president of the Thailand Bangkok North Stake We see God s miracles in His wondrous work and in our own personal lives The miracle of the Church in the Ivory Coast cannot be told without the names of two couples Philippe and Annelies Assard and Lucien and Agathe Affoue They joined the Church as young married couples one in Germany and one in France In the 1980s Philippe and Lucien felt drawn back to their native African country for the purpose of building the kingdom of God For Sister Assard who is German to leave her family and allow Brother Assard to leave his work as an accomplished mechanical engineer required unusual faith The two couples met each other for the first time in the Ivory Coast and started a Sunday School That was 30 years ago There are now eight stakes and 27 000 members in this beautiful African country The Affoues continue to serve nobly as do the Assards who recently completed a mission to the Accra Ghana Temple Can you see the hand of God moving His work forward Can you see the hand of God in the lives of the missionaries in Haiti or the Kaivaivatanas in Thailand Can you see the hand of God in the lives of the Assards and the Affoues Can you see the hand of God in your own life And in nothing doth man offend God save those who confess not his hand in all things 13God s miracles are not happening just in Haiti Thailand or the Ivory Coast Look around you 14 God is mindful of every people yea he numbereth his people and his mercy is over all the earth 15Sometimes we can see the hand of the Lord in the lives of others but wonder How can I more clearly see His hand in my own life The Savior said Doubt not 16 Be not afraid 17 Not one sparrow shall fall to the ground without your Father knowing Fear not therefore for ye are of more value than many sparrows 18Remember the young man who cried out to the prophet Elisha as they were surrounded by enemies Alas what shall we do 19Elisha answered Fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them Then Elisha prayed Lord open his eyes that he may see And the Lord did open the eyes of the young man and he did see that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire 20As you keep the commandments and pray in faith to see the Lord s hand in your life I promise you that He will open your spiritual eyes even wider and you will see more clearly that you are not alone The scriptures teach that we are to stand steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come 21 What is to come The Savior prayed Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven 22We all just sang Come O Thou King of Kings Our faith grows as we anticipate the glorious day of the Savior s return to the earth The thought of His coming stirs my soul It will be breathtaking The scope and grandeur the vastness and magnificence will exceed anything mortal eyes have ever seen or experienced In that day He will not come wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger 23 but He will appear in the clouds of heaven clothed with power and great glory with all the holy angels 24 We will hear the voice of the archangel and the trump of God 25 The sun and the moon will be transformed and stars will be hurled from their places 26 You and I or those who follow us the saints from every quarter of the earth 27 shall be quickened and caught up to meet him 28 and those who have died in righteousness they too will be caught up to meet him in the midst of heaven 29Then a seemingly impossible experience All flesh the Lord says shall see me together 30 How will it happen We do not know But I testify it will happen exactly as prophesied We will kneel in reverence and the Lord shall utter his voice and all the ends of the earth shall hear it 31 It shall be as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder 32 Then the Lord the Savior shall stand in the midst of his people 33There will be unforgettable reunions with the angels of heaven and the Saints upon the earth 34 But most important as Isaiah declares All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God 35 and He shall reign over all flesh 36In that day the skeptics will be silent for every ear shall hear and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess 37 that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God the Savior and Redeemer of the world Today is Easter We rejoice with Christians all over the world in His glorious Resurrection and in our own promised resurrection May we prepare for His coming by rehearsing these glorious events over and over in our own minds and with those we love and may His prayer be our prayer Thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven 38 I testify that He lives Come O thou King of Kings In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On his first visit to the Prophet Joseph Smith at age 17 an angel called Joseph by name and told him that he Moroni was a messenger sent from the presence of God and that God had a work for him to do Imagine what Joseph must have thought when the angel then told him that his name would be had for good and evil among all nations kindreds and tongues 1 Perhaps the shock in Joseph s eyes caused Moroni to repeat again that both good and evil would be spoken of him among all people 2The good spoken of Joseph Smith came slowly the evil speaking began immediately Joseph wrote How very strange it was that an obscure boy should be thought of sufficient importance to attract the most bitter persecution 3While love for Joseph grew so also did hostility At the age of 38 he was murdered by a mob of 150 men with painted faces 4 While the Prophet s life abruptly ended the good and evil spoken of Joseph was just beginning Should we be surprised with the evil spoken against him The Apostle Paul was called mad and deranged 5 Our Beloved Savior the Son of God was labeled gluttonous a winebibber and possessed of a devil 6The Lord told Joseph of his destiny The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name and fools shall have thee in derision and hell shall rage against thee While the pure in heart the wise and the virtuous shall seek blessings constantly from under thy hand 7Why does the Lord allow the evil speaking to chase after the good One reason is that opposition against the things of God sends seekers of truth to their knees for answers 8Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration His spiritual work began with the appearance of the Father and the Son followed by numerous heavenly visitations He was the instrument in God s hands in bringing forth sacred scripture lost doctrine and the restoration of the priesthood The importance of Joseph s work requires more than intellectual consideration it requires that we like Joseph ask of God 9 Spiritual questions deserve spiritual answers from God Many of those who dismiss the work of the Restoration simply do not believe that heavenly beings speak to men on earth Impossible they say that golden plates were delivered by an angel and translated by the power of God From that disbelief they quickly reject Joseph s testimony and a few unfortunately sink to discrediting the Prophet s life and slandering his character We are especially saddened when someone who once revered Joseph retreats from his or her conviction and then maligns the Prophet 10 Studying the Church through the eyes of its defectors Elder Neal A Maxwell once said is like interviewing Judas to understand Jesus Defectors always tell us more about themselves than about that from which they have departed 11Jesus said Bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you 12 Let us offer kindness to those who criticize Joseph Smith knowing in our own hearts that he was a prophet of God and taking comfort that all this was long ago foretold by Moroni How should we respond to a sincere inquirer who is concerned about negative comments he or she has heard or read about the Prophet Joseph Smith Of course we always welcome honest and genuine questions To questions about Joseph s character we might share the words of thousands who knew him personally and who gave their lives for the work he helped establish John Taylor who was shot four times by the mob that killed Joseph would later declare I testify before God angels and men that Joseph was a good honorable and virtuous man and that his private and public character was unimpeachable and that he lived and died as a man of God 13We might remind the sincere inquirer that Internet information does not have a truth filter Some information no matter how convincing is simply not true Years ago I read a Time magazine article that reported the discovery of a letter supposedly written by Martin Harris that conflicted with Joseph Smith s account of finding the Book of Mormon plates 14A few members left the Church because of the document 15Sadly they left too quickly Months later experts discovered and the forger confessed that the letter was a complete deception 16 You may understandably question what you hear on the news but you need never doubt the testimony of God s prophets We might remind the inquirer that some information about Joseph while true may be presented completely out of context to his own day and situation Elder Russell M Nelson illustrated this point He said I was serving as a consultant to the United States government at its National Center for Disease Control in Atlanta Georgia Once while awaiting a taxi to take me to the airport after our meetings were over I stretched out on the lawn to soak in a few welcome rays of sunshine before returning to the winter weather of Utah Later I received a photograph in the mail taken by a photographer with a telephoto lens capturing my moment of relaxation on the lawn Under it was a caption Governmental consultant at the National Center The picture was true the caption was true but the truth was used to promote a false impression 17 We do not discard something we know to be true because of something we do not yet understand We might remind the inquirer that Joseph was not alone in the visit of angels The Book of Mormon witnesses wrote We declare with words of soberness that an angel of God came down from heaven and we beheld and saw the plates 18 We could quote many others as well 19A sincere inquirer should see the spreading of the restored gospel as the fruit of the Lord s work through the Prophet There are now more than 29 000 congregations and 88 000 missionaries teaching the gospel across the world Millions of Latter day Saints are seeking to follow Jesus Christ live honorable lives care for the poor and give of their time and talents in helping others Jesus said A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit By their fruits ye shall know them 20These explanations are convincing but the sincere inquirer should not rely on them exclusively to settle his or her search for truth Each believer needs a spiritual confirmation of the divine mission and character of the Prophet Joseph Smith This is true for every generation Spiritual questions deserve spiritual answers from God Recently while I was on the East Coast of the United States a returned missionary spoke to me about a friend who had become disillusioned with information he had received about the Prophet Joseph Smith They had spoken several times and the returned missionary seemed to have some doubts himself as a result of the discussions Although I hoped he could strengthen his friend I felt concerned for his own testimony Brothers and sisters let me give you a caution you won t be of much help to others if your own faith is not securely in place A few weeks ago I boarded a plane for South America The flight attendant directed our attention to a safety video It is unlikely we were warned but if cabin pressure changes the panels above your seat will open revealing oxygen masks If this happens reach up and pull a mask toward you Place the mask over your nose and mouth Slip the elastic strap over your head and adjust the mask if necessary Then this caution Be sure to adjust your own mask before helping others The negative commentary about the Prophet Joseph Smith will increase as we move toward the Second Coming of the Savior The half truths and subtle deceptions will not diminish There will be family members and friends who will need your help Now is the time to adjust your own spiritual oxygen mask so that you are prepared to help others who are seeking the truth 21A testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith can come differently to each of us It may come as you kneel in prayer asking God to confirm that he was a true prophet It may come as you read the Prophet s account of the First Vision A testimony may distill upon your soul as you read the Book of Mormon again and again It may come as you bear your own testimony of the Prophet or as you stand in the temple and realize that through Joseph Smith the holy sealing power was restored to the earth 22 With faith and real intent your testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith will strengthen The constant water balloon volleys from the sidelines may occasionally get you wet but they need never never extinguish your burning fire of faith To the youth listening today or reading these words in the days ahead I give a specific challenge Gain a personal witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith Let your voice help fulfill Moroni s prophetic words to speak good of the Prophet Here are two ideas First find scriptures in the Book of Mormon that you feel and know are absolutely true Then share them with family and friends in family home evening seminary and your Young Men and Young Women classes acknowledging that Joseph was an instrument in God s hands Next read the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Pearl of Great Price or in this pamphlet now in 158 languages You can find it online at LDS org or with the missionaries This is Joseph s own testimony of what actually occurred Read it often Consider recording the testimony of Joseph Smith in your own voice listening to it regularly and sharing it with friends Listening to the Prophet s testimony in your own voice will help bring the witness you seek The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith is now in 158 languages There are great and wonderful days ahead President Thomas S Monson has said This great cause will continue to go forth changing and blessing lives No force in the entire world can stop the work of God Despite what comes this great cause will go forward 23I give you my witness that Jesus is the Christ our Savior and Redeemer He chose a holy man a righteous man to lead the Restoration of the fulness of His gospel He chose Joseph Smith I testify that Joseph Smith was an honest and virtuous man a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ did appear to him He did translate the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God In our society beyond the veil of death we will clearly understand the sacred calling and divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith In that not too distant day you and I and millions more shall know Brother Joseph again 24 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I greet you this morning especially the young people who are both here in the Conference Center and throughout the world Yours is a chosen generation of destiny and I speak especially to you Many years ago while we were visiting our family in Florida a tornado touched down not too far from us One woman living in a mobile home went into her bathroom for safety The mobile home began to shake A few moments passed Then she heard her neighbor s voice I am here in the front room Coming out of the bathroom to her great astonishment she discovered that the tornado had lifted and carried her mobile home through the air landing it perfectly upright on the top of her neighbor s mobile home My young friends the world will not glide calmly toward the Second Coming of the Savior The scriptures declare that all things shall be in commotion 1 Brigham Young said It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church that the Church would spread prosper grow and extend and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth so would the power of Satan rise 2More concerning than the prophesied earthquakes and wars3 are the spiritual whirlwinds that can uproot you from your spiritual foundations and land your spirit in places you never imagined possible sometimes with your barely noticing that you have been moved The worst whirlwinds are the temptations of the adversary Sin has always been part of the world but it has never been so accessible insatiable and acceptable There is of course a powerful force that will subdue the whirlwinds of sin It is called repentance Not all the whirlwinds in life are of your own making Some come because of the wrong choices of others and some come just because this is mortality As a young boy President Boyd K Packer suffered from the crippling disease of polio When Elder Dallin H Oaks was seven years old his father died suddenly When Sister Carol F McConkie of the Young Women general presidency was a teenager her parents divorced Challenges will come to you but as you trust in God they will strengthen your faith In nature trees that grow up in a windy environment become stronger As winds whip around a young sapling forces inside the tree do two things First they stimulate the roots to grow faster and spread farther Second the forces in the tree start creating cell structures that actually make the trunk and branches thicker and more flexible to the pressure of the wind These stronger roots and branches protect the tree from winds that are sure to return 4You are infinitely more precious to God than a tree You are His son or His daughter He made your spirit strong and capable of being resilient to the whirlwinds of life The whirlwinds in your youth like the wind against a young tree can increase your spiritual strength preparing you for the years ahead How do you prepare for your whirlwinds Remember it is upon the rock of our Redeemer who is Christ the Son of God that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds his shafts in the whirlwind when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power to drag you down because of the rock upon which ye are built 5 This is your safety in the whirlwind President Thomas S Monson has said Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible now there is a wide chasm between us and it s growing ever wider 6 This chasm for some stirs strong spiritual whirlwinds Let me share an example This past month the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve published a letter to leaders of the Church across the world In part it read Changes in the civil law do not indeed cannot change the moral law that God has established God expects us to uphold and keep His commandments regardless of divergent opinions or trends in society His law of chastity is clear sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife We urge you to review the doctrine contained in The Family A Proclamation to the World 7As the world slips away from the Lord s law of chastity we do not President Monson said The Savior of mankind described Himself as being in the world but not of the world We also can be in the world but not of the world as we reject false concepts and false teachings and remain true to that which God has commanded 8While many governments and well meaning individuals have redefined marriage the Lord has not In the very beginning God initiated marriage between a man and a woman Adam and Eve He designated the purposes of marriage to go far beyond the personal satisfaction and fulfillment of adults to more importantly advancing the ideal setting for children to be born reared and nurtured Families are the treasure of heaven 9Why do we continue to talk about this As Paul said We look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen 10 As Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ we have the responsibility to teach our Creator s plan for His children and to warn of the consequences of disregarding His commandments Recently I spoke with a Laurel from the United States I quote from her email This past year some of my friends on Facebook began posting their position on marriage Many favored same sex marriage and several LDS youth indicated they liked the postings I made no comment I decided to declare my belief in traditional marriage in a thoughtful way With my profile picture I added the caption I believe in marriage between a man and a woman Almost instantly I started receiving messages You are selfish You are judgmental One compared me to a slave owner And I received this post from a great friend who is a strong member of the Church You need to catch up with the times Things are changing and so should you I did not fight back she said but I did not take my statement down She concludes Sometimes as President Monson said You have to stand alone Hopefully as youth we will stand together in being true to God and to the teachings of His living prophets 11Of special concern to us should be those who struggle with same sex attraction It is a whirlwind of enormous velocity I want to express my love and admiration for those who courageously confront this trial of faith and stay true to the commandments of God 12 But everyone independent of his or her decisions and beliefs deserves our kindness and consideration 13The Savior taught us to love not only our friends but also those who disagree with us and even those who repudiate us He said For if ye love them which love you what reward have ye And if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others 14The Prophet Joseph Smith warned us to beware of self righteousness and to enlarge our hearts toward all men and women until we feel to take them upon our shoulders 15 In the gospel of Jesus Christ there is no place for ridicule bullying or bigotry If you have a question about counsel from the leaders of the Church please discuss your honest concerns with your parents and leaders You need the strength that comes from trusting the Lord s prophets President Harold B Lee said The only safety we have as members of this church is to learn to give heed to the words and commandments that the Lord shall give through His prophet There will be some things that take patience and faith You may not like what comes It may contradict your political views your social views interfere with your social life But if you listen to these things as if from the mouth of the Lord Himself the gates of hell shall not prevail against you and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you D C 21 6 16Another powerful protection from the whirlwinds of life is the Book of Mormon When President Henry B Eyring was a teenager his family moved to a new city He initially found the move unpleasant and made few friends He felt like he didn t fit in with the students in his high school The whirlwinds were swirling What did he do He threw his energy into the Book of Mormon reading it many times 17 Years later President Eyring testified I love to go back to the Book of Mormon and drink deeply and often 18 It is the most powerful written testimony we have that Jesus is the Christ 19The Lord has given you another way to stand firm a spiritual gift more powerful than the whirlwinds of the adversary He said Stand in holy places and be not moved 20When I was a teenager there were only 13 temples in the Church Now there are 142 Eighty five percent of Church members live within 200 miles 320 km of a temple The Lord has given your generation greater access to His holy temples than any other generation in the history of the world Have you ever stood in the temple dressed in white waiting to do baptisms How did you feel There is a tangible feeling of holiness in the temple The peace of the Savior subdues the swirling whirlwinds of the world The way you feel in the temple is a pattern for how you want to feel in your life 21Find your grandfathers and grandmothers and your distant cousins who have gone before you Take their names to the temple with you 22 As you learn about your ancestors you will see patterns of life of marriage of children patterns of righteousness and occasionally patterns that you will want to avoid 23Later in the temple you will learn more about the Creation of the world about the patterns in the lives of Adam and Eve and most importantly about our Savior Jesus Christ My young brothers and sisters how we love you admire you and pray for you Don t let the whirlwinds drag you down These are your days to stand strong as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ 24Build more firmly your foundation upon the rock of your Redeemer Treasure more completely His incomparable life and teachings Follow more diligently His example and His commandments Embrace more deeply His love His mercy and grace and the powerful gifts of His Atonement As you do I promise you that you will see the whirlwinds for what they are tests temptations distractions or challenges to help you grow And as you live righteously year after year I assure you that your experiences will confirm to you again and again that Jesus is the Christ The spiritual rock under your feet will be solid and secure You will rejoice that God has placed you here to be a part of the final preparations for Christ s glorious return The Savior said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you 25 This is His promise to you I know this promise is real I know that He lives in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Priesthood Blessings Are for AllAs the children in sacrament meeting happily sang the Primary song Love Is Spoken Here everyone smiled with approval A courageous mother raising five children listened attentively to the second verse Mine is a home where every hour is blessed by the strength of priesthood power 1 Sadly she thought My children have never known such a home 2My message to this faithful woman and to all is that we can live every hour blessed by the strength of priesthood power whatever our circumstance We sometimes overly associate the power of the priesthood with men in the Church The priesthood is the power and authority of God given for the salvation and blessing of all men women and children A man may open the drapes so the warm sunlight comes into the room but the man does not own the sun or the light or the warmth it brings The blessings of the priesthood are infinitely greater than the one who is asked to administer the gift To receive the blessings power and promises of the priesthood in this life and the next is one of the great opportunities and responsibilities of mortality As we are worthy the ordinances of the priesthood enrich our lives on earth and prepare us for the magnificent promises of the world ahead The Lord said In the ordinances the power of godliness is manifest 3There are special blessings from God for every worthy person who is baptized receives the Holy Ghost and regularly partakes of the sacrament The temple brings added light and strength along with the promise of eternal life 4All of the ordinances invite us to increase our faith in Jesus Christ and to make and keep covenants with God As we keep these sacred covenants we receive priesthood power and blessings Do we not feel this power of the priesthood in our own lives and see it among the covenant keeping members of the Church We see it in new converts as they step from the waters of baptism feeling forgiven and clean We see our children and youth more sensitive to the promptings and guidance of the Holy Ghost We see the ordinances of the temple becoming a beacon of strength and light for righteous men and women across the world This past month I watched a young couple draw enormous strength from the sealing promises of the temple as their precious baby boy was born but lived only one week Through the ordinances of the priesthood this young couple and all of us receive comfort strength protection peace and eternal promises 5What We Know about the PriesthoodSome may sincerely ask the question If the power and blessings of the priesthood are available to all why are the ordinances of the priesthood administered by men When an angel asked Nephi Knowest thou the condescension of God Nephi answered honestly I know that he loveth his children nevertheless I do not know the meaning of all things 6When we speak of the priesthood there are many things we do know All Are AlikeWe know that God loves all His children and is no respecter of persons He denieth none that come unto him male or female and all are alike unto God 7As surely as we know that God s love is alike for His sons and His daughters we also know that He did not create men and women exactly the same We know that gender is an essential characteristic of both our mortal and eternal identity and purpose Sacred responsibilities are given to each gender 8From the BeginningWe know that from the beginning the Lord established how His priesthood would be administered The Priesthood was first given to Adam 9 Noah Abraham and Moses all administered priesthood ordinances Jesus Christ was and is the Great High Priest He called Apostles Ye have not chosen me He said but I have chosen you and ordained you 10 In our day heavenly messengers were sent from God John the Baptist Peter James and John restored the priesthood to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith 11 This is the way our Father in Heaven has administered His priesthood 12Many Gifts from GodWe know that the power of the holy priesthood does not work independently of faith the Holy Ghost and spiritual gifts The scriptures caution Deny not the gifts of God for they are many And there are different ways that these gifts are administered but it is the same God who worketh them all 13WorthinessWe know that worthiness is central to performing and receiving priesthood ordinances Sister Linda K Burton general president of the Relief Society has said Righteousness is the qualifier to invite priesthood power into our lives 14For example consider the plague of pornography sweeping across the world The Lord s standard of worthiness gives no allowance for pornography among those officiating in the ordinances of the priesthood The Savior said Repent of your secret abominations 15 The light of the body is the eye If thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness 16 For whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart 17Unworthily administering or passing the sacrament blessing the sick or participating in other priesthood ordinances is as Elder David A Bednar has said taking the name of God in vain 18 If one is unworthy he should withdraw from officiating in priesthood ordinances and prayerfully approach his bishop as a first step in repenting and returning to the commandments HumilityAnother thing we know is that there is an abundance of priesthood blessings in families where a righteous mother and father are united in guiding their children But we also know that God eagerly provides these same blessings to those in many other situations 19A mother carrying the weight of providing both spiritually and temporally for her family sensitively explained that calling her home teachers to bless one of her children requires her humility But she insightfully added that it requires no more humility than that of her home teachers as they prepare to bless her child 20The Keys of the PriesthoodWe know that the keys of the priesthood held by members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles direct the work of the Lord upon the earth Specific priesthood keys are conferred upon stake presidents and bishops for their geographic responsibilities And they call men and women by revelation who are sustained and set apart to exercise delegated authority to teach and administer 21While there are many things we do know about the priesthood seeing through the lens of mortality does not always give a complete understanding of the workings of God But His gentle reminder My thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways 22 reassures us that with time and eternal perspective we will see things as they really are 23 and more completely understand His perfect love We all willingly serve Sometimes we feel underwhelmed with our calling and wish we were asked to do more Other times we are grateful when it is time for our release We do not determine the callings we receive 24 I learned this lesson early in my marriage As a young couple my wife Kathy and I lived in Florida One Sunday a counselor in the stake presidency explained to me that they felt impressed to call Kathy as an early morning seminary teacher How will we do it I asked We have small children seminary begins at 5 00 a m and I am the ward Young Men president The counselor smiled and said It will be OK Brother Andersen We will call her and we will release you And that is what happened The Contribution of WomenSincerely asking for and listening to the thoughts and concerns voiced by women is vital in life in marriage and in building the kingdom of God Twenty years ago in general conference Elder M Russell Ballard related a conversation he had with the general president of the Relief Society There was a question raised about strengthening the worthiness of youth preparing to serve missions Sister Elaine Jack said with a smile You know Elder Ballard the women of the Church may have some good suggestions if they are asked After all we are their mothers 25President Thomas S Monson has a lifelong history of asking for and responding to the concerns of women The woman who has influenced him the most is Sister Frances Monson We miss her very much Also just this past Thursday President Monson reminded the General Authorities how much he learned as a bishop from the 84 widows of his ward They greatly influenced his service and his entire life Not surprisingly before President Monson s prayerful decision about the age change for missionary service there were many discussions with the general Relief Society Young Women and Primary presidencies Bishops as you follow the example of President Monson you will feel even more abundantly the guiding hand of the Lord blessing your sacred work We lived several years in Brazil Soon after arriving I met Adelson Parrella who was serving as a Seventy and his brother Adilson who was serving in our stake presidency Later I met their brother Adalton serving as a stake president in Florianopolis and another brother Adelmo serving as a bishop I was impressed by the faith of these brothers and I asked about their parents The family was baptized in Santos Brazil 42 years ago Adilson Parrella said At first Father seemed very excited about joining the Church However he soon became less active and asked our mother not to attend church Adilson told me that his mother sewed clothing for the neighbors to pay for her children s bus fare to church The four little boys walked together over a mile to another town boarded the bus for 45 minutes and then walked another 20 minutes to the chapel Although unable to go to church with her children Sister Parrella read the scriptures with her sons and daughters taught them the gospel and prayed with them Their humble home was filled with the rich blessings of priesthood power The little boys grew up served missions were educated and married in the temple The blessings of the priesthood filled their homes Years later as a single sister Vany Parrella entered the temple for her own endowment and later still served three missions in Brazil She is now 84 years old and her faith continues to bless the generations that have followed her Testimony and PromiseThe power of God s holy priesthood is found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I testify that as you worthily participate in the ordinances of the priesthood the Lord will give you greater strength peace and eternal perspective Whatever your situation your home will be blessed by the strength of priesthood power and those close to you will more fully desire these blessings for themselves As men and women sisters and brothers sons and daughters of God we move forward together This is our opportunity our responsibility and our blessing This is our destiny to prepare the kingdom of God for the return of the Savior In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The mortal life of Jesus Christ was filled with miracles a virgin mother a new star angels appearing to shepherds the blind seeing the lame walking angels in Gethsemane and at the tomb and the greatest miracle of all His glorious Resurrection Can you imagine the scene of the eleven Apostles on the mountain near Galilee when the risen Lord came to them and said Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost 1 Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature 2 All nations All the world Every creature Was it possible Although Jesus reassured them they must have wondered if miracles really would accompany them in spreading the gospel 3Faith overcame doubt and Peter lifted his voice saying All ye that dwell at Jerusalem hearken to my words Jesus of Nazareth whom ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain This Jesus God hath raised up and we all are witnesses 4There was an undeniable spiritual outpouring that day and 3 000 souls were baptized As Jesus promised signs and miracles were following the faith of the believers As the Church of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth 183 years ago the Lord s charge to His small band of disciples echoed His words spoken centuries before The voice of warning shall be unto all people 5 For verily the sound must go forth into all the world and unto the uttermost parts of the earth 6 All people All the world The uttermost parts of the earth Was it possible The Savior reassured His Latter day Saints 7 but could they foresee the reach and destiny of this marvelous work They must have wondered if miracles really would accompany them in spreading the gospel Again faith overcame doubt and thousands were baptized In England Elder Wilford Woodruff found an entire community awaiting his arrival The Spirit of the Lord fell upon them and he baptized 45 preachers and several hundred members during his first month at Benbow farm 8Our day is no different When Elder David A Bednar and I were missionaries approximately 40 years ago and I can assure you that we are not the oldest of the returned missionaries sitting in the red chairs there were 16 000 missionaries As President Thomas S Monson reported yesterday we now have 65 000 more than ever before There were then 562 stakes Today there are more than 3 000 At that time our wards and branches were in 59 countries Today we have congregations in 189 of the 224 nations and territories of the world We are few in number just as Nephi foretold 9 But at the same time you and I are eyewitnesses of Daniel s prophetic words the stone cut without hands is filling the whole earth 10Our day is a remarkable time of miracles Six months ago as President Monson announced the age change for young men and young women desiring to serve missions there was an undeniable spiritual outpouring Faith overcame doubt and young men and women moved forward The Thursday following conference I was assigned to recommend missionary calls to the First Presidency I was amazed to see the applications of 18 year old men and 19 year old women who had already adjusted their plans visited their doctors been interviewed by their bishops and stake presidents and submitted their missionary applications all in just five days Thousands more have now joined them It s a miracle We are grateful for the energizing faith of our sisters the growing number of missionaries from countries across the world and the increasing number of couples ready to serve Fifty eight new missions have been announced and our bulging missionary training center in Provo has amazingly found a new companion in Mexico City President Thomas S Monson has said We take most seriously the Savior s mandate Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost 11 This cause will continue to go forth changing and blessing lives No force in the entire world can stop the work of God 12We are witnessing the miracles of the Lord as His gospel is spreading across the world Brothers and sisters as surely as the Lord has inspired more missionaries to serve He is also awakening the minds and opening the hearts of more good and honest people to receive His missionaries You already know them or will know them They are in your family and live in your neighborhood They walk past you on the street sit by you in school and connect with you online You too are an important part of this unfolding miracle If you re not a full time missionary with a missionary badge pinned on your coat now is the time to paint one on your heart painted as Paul said not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God 13 And returned missionaries find your old missionary tag Don t wear it but put it where you can see it The Lord needs you now more than ever to be an instrument in His hands All of us have a contribution to make to this miracle Every righteous member of the Church has thought about how to share the gospel Some share the gospel naturally and we can learn a lot from them 14 Some struggle and wonder how to do better wishing that guilty feeling we sometimes feel would find somewhere else to go Our desire to share the gospel takes all of us to our knees and it should because we need the Lord s help President Monson has asked that we pray for those areas where our influence is limited and where we are not allowed to share the gospel freely 15 As we earnestly and unitedly petition our Father in Heaven the Lord will continue to open important doors for us We also pray for our own opportunities to share the gospel The Apostle Peter said Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh a reason for the hope that is in you 16With the confusion17 and commotion18 of today s world it s not surprising that fewer people are attending their places of worship Although many want to be closer to God and to better understand the purpose of life they have unanswered questions Many have hearts open to the truth but as the prophet Amos described they are running to and fro seeking the word of the Lord and cannot find it 19 You can help answer their questions In your everyday conversations you can add to their faith in Christ 20The Savior said Hold up your light that it may shine unto the world Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up 21I promise you as you pray to know with whom to speak names and faces will come into your mind Words to speak will be given in the very moment you need them 22 Opportunities will open to you Faith will overcome doubt and the Lord will bless you with your very own miracles The Savior taught us how to share the gospel I like the story of Andrew who asked Master where dwellest thou 23 Jesus could have responded with the location of where He lived But instead He said to Andrew Come and see 24 I like to think that the Savior was saying Come and see not only where I live but how I live Come and see who I am Come and feel the Spirit We don t know everything about that day but we do know that when Andrew found his brother Simon he declared We have found the Christ 25To those who show an interest in our conversations we can follow the Savior s example by inviting them to come and see Some will accept our invitation and others will not We all know someone who has been invited several times before accepting an invitation to come and see Let s also think about those who once were with us but who now we rarely see inviting them to come back and see once more We respect each person s choice and timing The Lord said Let every man choose for himself 26 A person s lack of interest need not diminish our bonds of friendship and love Whether or not the invitation is accepted as you invite others to come and see you will feel the approval of the Lord and with that approval an added measure of faith to share your beliefs again and again For those using the Internet and mobile phones there are new ways to invite others to come and see Let s make sharing our faith online more a part of our daily life LDS org Mormon org Facebook Twitter all provide opportunities To share the gospel young members in Boston started several blogs 27 Those who joined the Church began their learning online followed by discussions with the missionaries This experience also helped the youth have greater faith in talking about the gospel in person One of them said This isn t missionary work This is missionary fun 28We are all in this together With fellow ward members and missionaries we plan and pray and help one another Please keep the full time missionaries in your thoughts and prayers Trust them with your family and friends The Lord trusts them and has called them to teach and bless those who seek Him President Paulo Kretly of the Mozambique Maputo Mission shared this experience It is common in Mozambique for couples to live their lives together without being married because African tradition require s an expensive dowry to marry a dowry most couples can t afford 29Members and missionaries thought and prayed about how to help The answer to their prayers was that they would emphasize the law of chastity and the importance of marriage and eternal families And while helping couples to repent and legally marry they would teach of the happiness that only comes through following Jesus Christ This is a picture of couples from two different cities in Mozambique Married on Friday they were baptized with their older children on Saturday 30 Friends and family were invited to come and see and hundreds did come and see Following the baptism one sister said We needed to choose whether to follow the traditions of our fathers or to follow Jesus Christ We chose to follow Christ 31You may not live in Mozambique but in your own way in your own culture you can share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Pray to your Heavenly Father This is His sacred work He will guide you in what to do He will open doors remove roadblocks and help you overcome obstacles The Lord declared The voice of warning shall be unto all people by the mouths of my disciples and none shall stay them 32I testify that the voice of the Lord shall be unto the ends of the earth that all that will hear may hear 33 It s a miracle It is a miracle In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Ten years ago as my wife Kathy and I were living in S o Paulo Brazil President David Marriott was presiding over the Brazil S o Paulo Interlagos Mission He and his wife Neill and their sons Will Wesley and Trace lived near us They had left their home their business and many in their family to respond to a call from the prophet to serve a mission President Marriott called me one afternoon Their precious righteous 21 year old daughter Georgia a senior in violin performance at Indiana University had been hit by a truck while riding her bicycle home after a Church meeting On first report Georgia was doing well Hours later her condition dramatically worsened Family and friends began fasting and praying for a miracle for Georgia Her mother flew through the night from Brazil Arriving in Indiana the next day she was met by her older children who tearfully explained that they had been with Georgia as she passed away I watched the Marriott family at the time of this experience and in the months and years that followed They wept they prayed they spoke of Georgia they felt immense pain and sadness but their faith did not falter In this morning s session we heard of similar faith in the beautiful lives of the Bowen and Wilberger families 1The gift of faith is a priceless spiritual endowment This is life eternal Jesus prayed that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent 2Our faith is centered in God our Father and in His Son Jesus Christ our Savior and Redeemer It is bolstered by our knowledge that the fulness of the gospel has been restored to the earth that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and that prophets and apostles today hold the keys of the priesthood We treasure our faith work to strengthen our faith pray for increased faith and do all within our power to protect and defend our faith The Apostle Peter identified something he called a trial of your faith 3 He had experienced it Remember Jesus s words Simon Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not 4Peter later encouraged others Think it not strange he said concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you 5These fiery trials are designed to make you stronger but they have the potential to diminish or even destroy your trust in the Son of God and to weaken your resolve to keep your promises to Him These trials are often camouflaged making them difficult to identify They take root in our weaknesses our vulnerabilities our sensitivities or in those things that matter most to us A real but manageable test for one can be a fiery trial for another How do you remain steadfast and immovable 6 during a trial of faith You immerse yourself in the very things that helped build your core of faith you exercise faith in Christ you pray you ponder the scriptures you repent you keep the commandments and you serve others When faced with a trial of faith whatever you do you don t step away from the Church Distancing yourself from the kingdom of God during a trial of faith is like leaving the safety of a secure storm cellar just as the tornado comes into view The Apostle Paul said Ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God 7 It is within the sanctuary of the Church that we protect our faith Meeting together with others who believe we pray and find answers to our prayers we worship through music share testimony of the Savior serve one another and feel the Spirit of the Lord We partake of the sacrament receive the blessings of the priesthood and attend the temple The Lord declared In the ordinances the power of godliness is manifest 8 When you are faced with a test of faith stay within the safety and security of the household of God There is always a place for you here No trial is so large we can t overcome it together 9President Thomas S Monson said The moral compass of society has been evolving at a rapid rate Behaviors once considered inappropriate and immoral are now viewed by many as acceptable 10There are many single adults in the Church well beyond their early adult years While finding their present life different than they had anticipated they keep the law of chastity 11 It can be a trial of their faith I express my deep respect and admiration for these disciples of Christ God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife 12 In the New Testament the Savior lifted the moral standard for His followers when He declared Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart 13 He taught us not to condemn others but He was unafraid to speak directly Go He said and sin no more 14Our family has a friend You probably know someone like her or perhaps you are like her Always faithful serves nobly in the Church admired professionally adored by her family and while she anticipated marriage and children she is single I made the decision she said to put my trust in Jesus Christ Going to the temple frequently helps me keep a more eternal focus It reminds me I am never alone I have faith that no blessing will be withheld as I remain faithful to my covenants including the law of chastity 15Another friend served an outstanding mission followed by rigorous academic training He hoped to have a family His trial of faith feelings of same sex attraction He wrote me recently I am promised in my patriarchal blessing that I will have my own family someday Whether that will occur in this life or the next I do not know But what I do know is that I don t want to do anything that will jeopardize the blessings God has promised both me and my future posterity Living the law of chastity is a challenge but did we not come to earth to confront challenges and to show God our love and respect for Him by keeping His commandments I am blessed with good health the gospel a loving family and loyal friends I am grateful for my many blessings 16The world protests how can you ask so much The Lord responds My thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways For as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts 17These two followers of Christ and tens of thousands like them have felt the Savior s promise Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid 18Here is another trial There have always been a few who want to discredit the Church and to destroy faith Today they use the Internet Some of the information about the Church no matter how convincing is just not true In 1985 I remember a colleague walking into my business office in Florida He had a Time magazine article entitled Challenging Mormonism s Roots It spoke of a recently discovered letter supposedly written by Martin Harris that conflicted with Joseph Smith s account of finding the Book of Mormon plates 19My colleague asked if this new information would destroy the Mormon Church The article quoted a man who said he was leaving the Church over the document Later others reportedly left the Church 20 I m sure it was a trial of their faith A few months later experts discovered and the forger confessed that the letter was a complete fraud I remember really hoping that those who had left the Church because of this deception would find their way back A few question their faith when they find a statement made by a Church leader decades ago that seems incongruent with our doctrine There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk True principles are taught frequently and by many Our doctrine is not difficult to find The leaders of the Church are honest but imperfect men Remember the words of Moroni Condemn me not because of mine imperfection neither my father but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been 21Joseph Smith said I never told you I was perfect but there is no error in the revelations 22 The miracle of God s hand in the history and destiny of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is understood only through the lens of spiritual inquiry President Ezra Taft Benson said Every person eventually is backed up to the wall of faith and there must make his stand 23 Don t be surprised when it happens to you By definition trials will be trying There may be anguish confusion sleepless nights and pillows wet with tears But our trials need not be spiritually fatal They need not take us from our covenants or from the household of God Remember it is upon the rock of our Redeemer who is Christ the Son of God that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds yea his shafts in the whirlwind yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo because of the rock upon which ye are built which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall 24Like the intense fire that transforms iron into steel as we remain faithful during the fiery trial of our faith we are spiritually refined and strengthened Elder D Todd Christofferson explained what he learned from a personal trial Though I suffered then as I look back now I am grateful that there was not a quick solution to my problem The fact that I was forced to turn to God for help almost daily over an extended period of years taught me truly how to pray and get answers to prayer and taught me in a very practical way to have faith in God I came to know my Savior and my Heavenly Father in a way and to a degree that might not have happened otherwise or that might have taken me much longer to achieve I learned to trust in the Lord with all my heart I learned to walk with Him day by day 25Peter described these experiences as much more precious than gold 26 Moroni added that a witness follows the trial of your faith 27I began with the story of the Marriott family Last week Kathy and I joined them at Georgia s grave Ten years have passed Family and friends spoke of the love and memories they have of Georgia There were white helium balloons to celebrate her life Amid tears Georgia s mother tenderly spoke of the increased faith and understanding she has received and Georgia s father quietly told me of the promised witness that has come to him With faith come trials of faith bringing increased faith The Lord s comforting assurance to the Prophet Joseph Smith is the very same promise He makes to you in your trial of faith Hold on fear not for God shall be with you forever and ever 28 Of this I bear my sacred witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
A reporter from a leading Brazilian magazine studied the Church in preparation for a major news article 1 He examined our doctrine and visited the missionary training and humanitarian centers He spoke with friends of the Church and with others who were not so friendly In the interview with me the reporter seemed honestly puzzled as he asked How could someone not consider you Christian I knew he was referring to the Church but my mind somehow framed the question personally and I found myself silently asking Does my life reflect the love and devotion I feel for the Savior Jesus asked the Pharisees What think ye of Christ 2 In the final assessment our personal discipleship will not be judged by friends or foes Rather as Paul said We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ 3 At that day the important question for each of us will be What thinks Christ of me Even with His love for all mankind Jesus reprovingly referred to some around Him as hypocrites 4 fools 5 and workers of iniquity 6 He approvingly called others children of the kingdom7 and the light of the world 8 He disapprovingly referred to some as blinded9 and unfruitful 10 He commended others as pure in heart11 and hungering after righteousness 12 He lamented that some were faithless13 and of the world 14 but others He esteemed as chosen 15 disciples 16 friends 17 And so we each ask What thinks Christ of me President Thomas S Monson has described our day as moving away from that which is spiritual with the winds of change swirling around us and the moral fiber of society continuing to disintegrate before our very eyes 18 It is a time of growing disbelief in and disregard for Christ and His teachings In this turbulent environment we rejoice in being disciples of Jesus Christ We see the Lord s hand all around us Our destination is beautifully set before us This is life eternal Jesus prayed that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent 19 Being a disciple in these days of destiny will be a badge of honor throughout the eternities The messages we have heard during this conference are guideposts from the Lord on our journey of discipleship As we have listened during the past two days praying for spiritual guidance and as we study and pray about these messages in the days ahead the Lord blesses us with customized direction through the gift of the Holy Ghost These feelings turn us even more toward God repenting obeying believing and trusting The Savior responds to our acts of faith If a man or woman love me he will keep my words and my Father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him 20Jesus s call Come follow me 21 is not only for those prepared to compete in a spiritual Olympics In fact discipleship is not a competition at all but an invitation to all Our journey of discipleship is not a dash around the track nor is it fully comparable to a lengthy marathon In truth it is a lifelong migration toward a more celestial world His invitation is a call to daily duty Jesus said If ye love me keep my commandments 22 If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me 23 We may not be at our very best every day but if we are trying Jesus s bidding is full of encouragement and hope Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest 24Wherever you now find yourself on the road of discipleship you are on the right road the road toward eternal life Together we can lift and strengthen one another in the great and important days ahead Whatever the difficulties confronting us the weaknesses confining us or the impossibilities surrounding us let us have faith in the Son of God who declared All things are possible to him that believeth 25Let me share two examples of discipleship in action The first is from the life of President Thomas S Monson demonstrating the power of simple kindness and Jesus s teaching He that is greatest among you shall be your servant 26Nearly 20 years ago President Monson spoke in general conference about a 12 year old young woman suffering from cancer He told of her courage and the kindness of her friends to carry her up Mount Timpanogos in central Utah A few years ago I met Jami Palmer Brinton and heard the story from a different perspective the perspective of what President Monson had done for her Jami met President Monson in March 1993 a day after being told that a mass above her right knee was a fast growing bone cancer With her father assisting President Monson administered a priesthood blessing promising Jesus will be on your right side and on your left side to buoy you up Upon leaving his office that day Jami said I unfastened a balloon tied to my wheelchair and gave it to him You re the Best it announced in bright letters Through her chemotherapy treatments and limb saving surgery President Monson did not forget her Jami said President Monson exemplified what it means to be a true disciple of Christ He lifted me from sorrow to great and abiding hope Three years after their first meeting Jami again sat in President Monson s office At the end of the meeting he did something that Jami will never forget So typical of President Monson s thoughtfulness he surprised her with the very same balloon that she had given to him three years before You re the Best the balloon proclaimed He had saved it knowing she would return to his office when she was cured of cancer Fourteen years after first meeting Jami President Monson performed her marriage to Jason Brinton in the Salt Lake Temple 27We can learn so much from the discipleship of President Monson He often reminds the General Authorities to remember this simple question What would Jesus do Jesus told the leader of the synagogue Be not afraid only believe 28 Discipleship is believing Him in seasons of peace and believing Him in seasons of difficulty when our pain and fear are calmed only by the conviction that He loves us and keeps His promises I recently met a family who is a beautiful example of how we believe Him Olgan and Soline Saintelus from Port au Prince Haiti told me their story On January 12 2010 Olgan was at work and Soline was at the church when a devastating earthquake struck Haiti Their three children Gancci age five Angie age three and Gansly age one were at home in their apartment with a friend Massive devastation was everywhere As you will remember tens of thousands lost their lives that January in Haiti Olgan and Soline ran as fast as they could to their apartment to find the children The three story apartment building where the Saintelus family lived had collapsed The children had not escaped No rescue efforts would be devoted to a building that was so completely destroyed Olgan and Soline Saintelus had both served full time missions and had been married in the temple They believed in the Savior and in His promises to them Yet their hearts were broken They wept uncontrollably Olgan told me that in his darkest hour he began to pray Heavenly Father if it be thy will if there could be just one of my children alive please please help us Over and over he walked around the building praying for inspiration The neighbors tried to comfort him and help him accept the loss of his children Olgan continued to walk around the rubble of the collapsed building hoping praying Then something quite miraculous happened Olgan heard the almost inaudible cry of a baby It was the cry of his baby For hours the neighbors frantically dug into the rubble risking their own lives In the dark of the night through the piercing sounds of hammers and chisels the rescue workers heard another sound They stopped their pounding and listened They couldn t believe what they were hearing It was the sound of a little child and he was singing Five year old Gancci later said that he knew his father would hear him if he sang Under the weight of crushing concrete that would later result in the amputation of his arm Gancci was singing his favorite song I Am a Child of God 29As the hours passed amid the darkness death and despair of so many other precious sons and daughters of God in Haiti the Saintelus family had a miracle Gancci Angie and Gansly were discovered alive under the flattened building 30Miracles are not always so immediate At times we thoughtfully wonder why the miracle we have so earnestly prayed for does not happen here and now But as we trust in the Savior promised miracles will occur Whether in this life or the next all will be made right The Savior declares Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid 31 In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 32I testify that as you love Him trust Him believe Him and follow Him you will feel His love and approval As you ask What thinks Christ of me you will know that you are His disciple you are His friend By His grace He will do for you what you cannot do for yourself We eagerly await the concluding remarks of our beloved prophet President Thomas S Monson was ordained an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ when I was 12 years old For more than 48 years we have been blessed to hear him bear witness of Jesus Christ I testify that he now stands as the Savior s senior Apostle upon the earth With great love and admiration for the many disciples of Jesus Christ who are not members of this Church we humbly declare that angels have returned to the earth in our day The Church of Jesus Christ as He established it anciently has been restored with the power ordinances and blessings of heaven The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ I witness that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world He suffered and died for our sins and rose the third day He is resurrected In a future day every knee will bow and every tongue confess that He is the Christ 33 On that day our concern will not be Do others consider me Christian At that time our eyes will be fixed on Him and our souls will be riveted on the question What thinks Christ of me He lives I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As we look into the eyes of a child we see a fellow son or daughter of God who stood with us in the premortal life It is a crowning privilege of a husband and wife who are able to bear children to provide mortal bodies for these spirit children of God We believe in families and we believe in children When a child is born to a husband and wife they are fulfilling part of our Heavenly Father s plan to bring children to earth The Lord said This is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 1 Before immortality there must be mortality The family is ordained of God Families are central to our Heavenly Father s plan here on earth and through the eternities After Adam and Eve were joined in marriage the scripture reads And God blessed them and God said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth 2 In our day prophets and apostles have declared The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife We declare that God s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force 3This commandment has not been forgotten or set aside in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 4 We express deep gratitude for the enormous faith shown by husbands and wives especially our wives in their willingness to have children When to have a child and how many children to have are private decisions to be made between a husband and wife and the Lord These are sacred decisions decisions that should be made with sincere prayer and acted on with great faith Years ago Elder James O Mason of the Seventy shared this story with me The birth of our sixth child was an unforgettable experience As I gazed on this beautiful new daughter in the nursery just moments after her birth I distinctly heard a voice declare There will yet be another and it will be a boy Unwisely I rushed back to the bedside of my absolutely exhausted wife and told her the good news It was very bad timing on my part 5 Year after year the Masons anticipated the arrival of their seventh child Three four five six seven years passed Finally after eight years their seventh child was born a little boy Last April President Thomas S Monson declared Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible now there is a wide chasm between us and it s growing ever wider The Savior of mankind described Himself as being in the world but not of the world We also can be in the world but not of the world as we reject false concepts and false teachings and remain true to that which God has commanded 6Many voices in the world today marginalize the importance of having children or suggest delaying or limiting children in a family My daughters recently referred me to a blog written by a Christian mother not of our faith with five children She commented Growing up in this culture it is very hard to get a biblical perspective on motherhood Children rank way below college Below world travel for sure Below the ability to go out at night at your leisure Below honing your body at the gym Below any job you may have or hope to get She then adds Motherhood is not a hobby it is a calling You do not collect children because you find them cuter than stamps It is not something to do if you can squeeze the time in It is what God gave you time for 7Having young children is not easy Many days are just difficult A young mother got on a bus with seven children The bus driver asked Are these all yours lady Or is it a picnic They re all mine she replied And it s no picnic 8As the world increasingly asks Are these all yours we thank you for creating within the Church a sanctuary for families where we honor and help mothers with children To a righteous father there are no words sufficient to express the gratitude and love he feels for his wife s incalculable gift of bearing and caring for their children Elder Mason had another experience just weeks after his marriage that helped him prioritize his family responsibilities He said Marie and I had rationalized that to get me through medical school it would be necessary for her to remain in the workplace Although this was not what we wanted to do children would have to come later While looking at a Church magazine at my parents home I saw an article by Elder Spencer W Kimball then of the Quorum of the Twelve highlighting responsibilities associated with marriage According to Elder Kimball one sacred responsibility was to multiply and replenish the earth My parents home was close to the Church Administration Building I immediately walked to the offices and 30 minutes after reading his article I found myself sitting across the desk from Elder Spencer W Kimball This wouldn t be so easy today I explained that I wanted to become a doctor There was no alternative but to postpone having our family Elder Kimball listened patiently and then responded in a soft voice Brother Mason would the Lord want you to break one of his important commandments in order for you to become a doctor With the help of the Lord you can have your family and still become a doctor Where is your faith Elder Mason continued Our first child was born less than a year later Marie and I worked hard and the Lord opened the windows of heaven The Masons were blessed with two more children before he graduated from medical school four years later 9Across the world this is a time of economic instability and financial uncertainty In April general conference President Thomas S Monson said If you are concerned about providing financially for a wife and family may I assure you that there is no shame in a couple having to scrimp and save It is generally during these challenging times that you will grow closer together as you learn to sacrifice and to make difficult decisions 10Elder Kimball s piercing question Where is your faith turns us to the holy scriptures It was not in the Garden of Eden that Adam and Eve bore their first child Leaving the garden Adam and Eve began to till the earth Adam knew his wife and she bore sons and daughters and acting in faith they began to multiply and to replenish the earth 11It was not in their Jerusalem home with gold silver and precious things that Lehi and Sariah acting in faith bore their sons Jacob and Joseph It was in the wilderness Lehi spoke of his son Jacob as my first born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness 12 Lehi said of Joseph Thou wast born in the wilderness of our afflictions yea in the days of our greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee 13In the book of Exodus a man and woman married and acting in faith had a baby boy There was no welcoming sign on the front door to announce his birth They hid him because Pharaoh had instructed that every newborn male Israelite should be cast into the river 14 You know the rest of the story the baby lovingly laid in a little ark made of bulrushes placed in the river watched over by his sister found by Pharaoh s daughter and cared for by his own mother as his nurse The boy was returned to Pharaoh s daughter who took him as her son and called him Moses In the most beloved story of a baby s birth there was no decorated nursery or designer crib only a manger for the Savior of the world In the best of times and the worst of times 15 the true Saints of God acting in faith have never forgotten dismissed or neglected God s commandment to multiply and replenish the earth 16 We go forward in faith realizing the decision of how many children to have and when to have them is between a husband and wife and the Lord We should not judge one another on this matter The bearing of children is a sensitive subject that can be very painful for righteous women who do not have the opportunity to marry and have a family To you noble women our Heavenly Father knows your prayers and desires How grateful we are for your remarkable influence including reaching out with loving arms to children who need your faith and strength The bearing of children can also be a heartbreaking subject for righteous couples who marry and find that they are unable to have the children they so anxiously anticipated or for a husband and wife who plan on having a large family but are blessed with a smaller family We cannot always explain the difficulties of our mortality Sometimes life seems very unfair especially when our greatest desire is to do exactly what the Lord has commanded As the Lord s servant I assure you that this promise is certain Faithful members whose circumstances do not allow them to receive the blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this life will receive all promised blessings in the eternities as they keep the covenants they have made with God 17President J Scott Dorius of the Peru Lima West Mission told me their story He said Becky and I were married for 25 years without being able to have or adopt children We moved several times Introducing ourselves in each new setting was awkward and sometimes painful Ward members wondered why we didn t have children They weren t the only ones wondering When I was called as a bishop ward members expressed concern that I did not have any experience with children and teenagers I thanked them for their sustaining vote and asked them to allow me to practice my child raising skills on their children They lovingly obliged We waited gained perspective and learned patience After 25 years of marriage a miracle baby came into our lives We adopted two year old Nicole and then newborn Nikolai Strangers now compliment us on our beautiful grandchildren We laugh and say They are our children We have lived our lives backwards 18Brothers and sisters we should not be judgmental with one another in this sacred and private responsibility And Jesus took a child in his arms and said Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me 19What a wonderful blessing we have to receive sons and daughters of God into our home Let us humbly and prayerfully seek to understand and accept God s commandments reverently listening for the voice of His Holy Spirit Families are central to God s eternal plan I testify of the great blessing of children and of the happiness they will bring us in this life and in the eternities in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I speak tonight especially to the 12 to 25 year olds who hold the priesthood of God We think about you a lot and we pray for you I once told the story of our four year old grandson giving his little brother a strong push After consoling the crying child my wife Kathy turned to the four year old and thoughtfully asked Why would you push your little brother He looked at his grandmother and responded Mimi I m sorry I lost my CTR ring and I cannot choose the right We know that you try hard to always choose the right We love you very much Have you ever thought about why you were sent to earth at this specific time You were not born during the time of Adam and Eve or while pharaohs ruled Egypt or during the Ming dynasty You have come to earth at this time 20 centuries after the first coming of Christ The priesthood of God has been restored to the earth and the Lord has set His hand to prepare the world for His glorious return These are days of great opportunity and important responsibilities These are your days With your baptism you declared your faith in Jesus Christ With your ordination to the priesthood your talents and spiritual capacities have been increased One of your important responsibilities is to help prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Savior The Lord has appointed a prophet President Thomas S Monson to direct the work of His priesthood To you President Monson has said The Lord needs missionaries 1 Every worthy able young man should prepare to serve a mission Missionary service is a priesthood duty an obligation the Lord expects of you who have been given so very much 2Missionary service requires sacrifice There will always be something you leave behind when you respond to the prophet s call to serve Those who follow the game of rugby know that the New Zealand All Blacks a name given because of the color of their uniform is the most celebrated rugby team ever 3 To be selected for the All Blacks in New Zealand would be comparable to playing for a football Super Bowl team or a World Cup soccer team In 1961 at age 18 and holding the Aaronic Priesthood Sidney Going was becoming a star in New Zealand rugby Because of his remarkable abilities many thought he would be chosen the very next year for the national All Blacks rugby team At age 19 in this critical moment of his ascending rugby career Sid declared that he would forgo rugby to serve a mission Some called him crazy Others called him foolish 4 They protested that his opportunity in rugby might never come again For Sid it was not what he was leaving behind it was the opportunity and responsibility ahead He had a priesthood duty to offer two years of his life to declare the reality of the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel Nothing not even a chance to play on the national team with all the acclaim it would bring would deter him from that duty 5He was called by a prophet of God to serve in the Western Canadian Mission Forty eight years ago this month 19 year old Elder Sidney Going left New Zealand to serve as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Sid told me of an experience he had on his mission It was evening and he and his companion were just about to return to their apartment They decided to visit one more family The father let them in Elder Going and his companion testified of the Savior The family accepted a Book of Mormon The father read all night In the next week and a half he read the entire Book of Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price A few weeks later the family was baptized 6A mission instead of a place on the New Zealand All Blacks team Sid responded The blessing of bringing others into the gospel far outweighs anything you will ever sacrifice 7You re probably wondering what happened to Sid Going following his mission Most important an eternal marriage to his sweetheart Colleen five noble children and a generation of grandchildren He has lived his life trusting in his Father in Heaven keeping the commandments and serving others And rugby After his mission Sid Going became one of the greatest halfbacks in All Blacks history playing for 11 seasons and serving for many years as captain of the team 8How good was Sid Going He was so good that training and game schedules were changed because he would not play on Sunday 9 Sid was so good the Queen of England acknowledged his contribution to rugby 10 He was so good a book was written about him titled Super Sid What if those honors had not come to Sid after his mission One of the great miracles of missionary service in this Church is that Sid Going and thousands just like him have not asked What will I get from my mission but rather What can I give Your mission will be a sacred opportunity to bring others to Christ and help prepare for the Second Coming of the Savior The Lord has long spoken of the necessary preparations for His Second Coming To Enoch He declared Righteousness will I send down out of heaven and truth will I send forth out of the earth and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood to gather out mine elect from the four quarters of the earth 11 The prophet Daniel prophesied that in the latter days the gospel would roll forth unto the ends of the earth as a stone that is cut out of a mountain without hands 12 Nephi spoke of the latter day Church as being few in number but spread upon all the face of the earth 13 The Lord declared in this dispensation Ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect 14 My young brethren your mission is a great opportunity and responsibility important to this promised gathering and linked to your eternal destiny From the early days of the Restoration the Brethren have been very serious about their charge to declare the gospel In 1837 only seven years after the organization of the Church at a time of poverty and persecution missionaries were sent to teach the gospel in England Within the next few years missionaries were preaching in such diverse places as Austria French Polynesia India Jamaica Chile and China 15The Lord has blessed this work and the Church is being established across the world This meeting is being translated into 92 languages We are grateful for the 52 225 full time missionaries serving in more than 150 countries 16 The sun never sets on righteous missionaries testifying of the Savior Think of the spiritual power of 52 000 missionaries endowed with the Spirit of the Lord boldly declaring that there is no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come only in and through the name of Christ 17 We express appreciation to the tens of thousands of returned missionaries who have given and continue to give their very best The world is being prepared for the Second Coming of the Savior in large measure because of the Lord s work through His missionaries Missionary service is a spiritual work Worthiness and preparation are essential President Monson has said Young men I admonish you to prepare for service as a missionary Keep yourselves clean and pure and worthy to represent the Lord 18 In the years prior to your mission please remember the sacred assignment ahead of you Your actions before your mission will greatly influence the priesthood power you bring with you into the mission Prepare yourself well President Monson spoke of every worthy able young man preparing to serve a mission 19 On occasion because of health or other reasons one might not be able to serve You will know your ability to serve as you speak with your parents and your bishop Should this be your situation please do not feel less important in the noble commission before you The Lord is very generous to those who love Him and He will open other doors for you Some may wonder if they are too old to serve A friend of mine from China found the Church in Cambodia when he was in his mid 20s He wondered if he should still consider a mission After praying and speaking with his bishop he was called and served nobly in New York City Should your age concern you pray and speak with your bishop He will guide you Fifty percent of all missionaries serve in their own homeland That is only right The Lord has promised that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue and in his own language 20 You will be called by prophecy and serve where you are needed most I love meeting missionaries around the world Recently while I was visiting the Australia Sydney Mission do you know whom I found Elder Sidney Going the New Zealand rugby legend Now age 67 he is once again a missionary but this time with a companion of his own choosing Sister Colleen Going He told me of a family they were able to teach The parents were members but had been less active in the Church for many many years Elder and Sister Going helped rekindle the family s faith Elder Going told me of the power he felt while standing at the baptismal font next to the father of the family as the oldest son now holding the priesthood baptized his younger brother and sister He expressed the joy of witnessing a united family pursuing eternal life together 21Speaking to you the First Presidency has said You are a choice spirit who has come forth in this day when the responsibilities and opportunities as well as the temptations are the greatest We pray for each of you that you can do the great work that lies before you that you will be worthy and willing to carry on the responsibilities of building the kingdom of God and preparing the world for the Second Coming of the Savior 22I love Harry Anderson s painting of the Second Coming of the Savior It reminds me that He will come in majesty and power Amazing events will unfold on the earth and in the skies 23Those awaiting the Savior s coming will look for Him And He has promised I will come The righteous will see Him in the clouds of heaven with all the holy angels clothed with power and great glory 24 An angel shall sound his trump and the saints from the four quarters of the earth 25 will be caught up to meet him 26 Those that have slept meaning those worthy Saints who have died shall also come forth to meet Him 27The scripture reads The Lord will set his foot upon the mount 28 and He shall utter his voice and all the ends of the earth shall hear it 29My young brethren of the priesthood I testify of the majesty but most of all of the certainty of this magnificent event The Savior lives He will return to the earth And whether on this side of the veil or the other you and I will rejoice in His coming and thank the Lord that He sent us to earth at this time to fulfill our sacred duty of helping prepare the world for His return In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters across the world I express my deep admiration for the faith and courage I see in your lives We live in a most remarkable time but a challenging time The Lord Alerts Us to Dangers AheadThe Lord has not left us alone in our quest to return to Him Listen to His warning words alerting us to the dangers ahead Take heed watch and pray 1 Beware lest ye be deceived 2 Be watchful and careful 3 Beware lest ye also fall from your own stedfastness 4No one of us is immune from the influences of the world The Lord s counsel keeps us on guard You will remember Jesus s experience in Capernaum as disciples who had followed the Savior would not accept that He was the Son of God The scripture reads From that time many of his disciples walked no more with him 5Jesus then turned to the Twelve and asked Will ye also go away 6Will Ye Also Go Away In my own mind I have answered that question many times Absolutely not Not me I will never leave Him I am here forever I know you have answered the same way But the question Will ye also go away makes us think about our own vulnerability Life is no spiritual picnic The words of the Apostles from another setting come quietly into our mind Lord is it I 7We enter the waters of baptism with joy and anticipation The Savior beckons Come unto me 8 and we respond taking His name upon us Not one of us wants this journey to be a brief flirtation with spirituality or even a notable but finite chapter The road of discipleship is not for the spiritually faint of heart Jesus said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind 9 Whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 10As we follow the Savior without question there will be challenges that confront us Approached with faith these refining experiences bring a deeper conversion of the Savior s reality Approached in a worldly way these same experiences cloud our view and weaken our resolve Some we love and admire slip from the strait and narrow path and walk no more with him How Do We Remain True How do we remain true to the Savior His gospel and the ordinances of His priesthood How do we develop the faith and strength to never leave Him Jesus said Except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven 11 We need the believing heart of a child Through the power of His Atonement we are to become as a child submissive meek humble patient full of love willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon us even as a child doth submit to his father 12 This is the mighty change of heart 13We soon see why a change of heart is necessary Two words signal danger ahead the words are offended and ashamed Choose Not to Be OffendedTo those troubled by the Savior s divinity Jesus asked Doth this offend you 14 In the parable of the sower Jesus warned He endureth for a while but when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended 15Offense comes in many costumes and continually finds its way onstage People we believe in disappoint us We have unanticipated difficulties Our life doesn t turn out exactly the way we were expecting We make mistakes feel unworthy and worry about being forgiven We wonder about a doctrinal issue We learn of something spoken from a Church pulpit 150 years ago that bothers us Our children are treated unfairly We are ignored or underappreciated It could be a hundred things each very real to us at the time 16In our weakened moments the adversary seeks to steal our spiritual promises If we are not watchful our injured childlike spirit will retreat back into the cold dark crust of our former bloated ego leaving behind the warm healing light of the Savior When Parley P Pratt in 1835 was judged unfairly bringing embarrassment and shame to him and his family the Prophet Joseph Smith counseled Parley walk such things under your feet and God Almighty shall be with you 17Another example In 1830 Frederick G Williams a prominent medical doctor was baptized He immediately gave of his talents and prosperity to the Church He became a leader in the Church He donated property for the Kirtland Temple In 1837 caught up in difficulties of the times Frederick G Williams made serious mistakes The Lord declared in a revelation that in consequence of his transgressions his former standing in the leadership of the Church had been taken away from him 18The beautiful lesson we learn from Frederick G Williams is that whatever his personal weaknesses he had the strength of character to renew his loyalty to the Lord the Prophet and to the Church when it would have been so easy to have disintegrated in bitterness 19 In the spring of 1840 he presented himself at a general conference humbly asking forgiveness for his past conduct and expressing his determination to do the will of God in the future His case was presented by Hyrum Smith and he was freely forgiven He died a faithful member of the Church I recently met the president of the Recife Brazil Temple whose name is Frederick G Williams He recounted how his great great grandfather s decision of character had blessed the family and hundreds of his posterity Choose Not to Be AshamedOffended has a corrosive companion called ashamed In the Book of Mormon we learn of Lehi s vision of the tree of life The vision speaks of those noble souls who pressed forward through the mist of darkness clinging to the rod of iron arriving and partaking of the fruit of the tree 20Nephi described the tree as the love of God 21 bearing fruit that filled the soul with exceedingly great joy 22After tasting of the fruit Lehi saw a great and spacious building filled with people old and young male and female and their dress was exceedingly fine and they were mocking and pointing their fingers of scorn towards those who were partaking of the fruit 23 An angel explained that the mocking the scoffing the fingers of scorn represented the pride and wisdom of the world 24Nephi declared plainly We heeded them not 25Sadly there were others whose courage faltered The scripture reads After they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed because of those who were scoffing at them and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost 26As disciples of Christ we stand apart from the world There may be times we feel uncomfortable as the fingers of scorn mock and dismiss what is sacred to us 27 President Thomas S Monson warned Unless the roots of your testimony are firmly planted it will be difficult for you to withstand the ridicule of those who challenge your faith 28 Nephi said Heed them not 29 Paul admonished God hath not given us the spirit of fear Be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord 30 We never leave Him While accompanying President Dieter F Uchtdorf to Eastern Europe last year I marveled at the faith and courage of the Saints One priesthood leader in Ukraine told us of being called to the branch presidency in the spring of 1994 only six months after his baptism This would require becoming public with his faith and helping to register the Church in the city of Dnipropetrovs k It was at a time of uncertainty in Ukraine and openly showing faith in Christ and in the restored gospel could mean difficulty including the possibility of losing his job as a pilot The priesthood leader told us I prayed and prayed I had a testimony and I had made a covenant I knew what the Lord wanted me to do 31 Courageously he and his wife went forward with faith unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ Where Much Is Given Much Is RequiredSome ask Do I have to be so different from others Can t I be a disciple of Christ without thinking so much about my behavior Can t I love Christ without keeping the law of chastity Can t I love Him and do what I want on Sunday Jesus gave a simple answer If ye love me keep my commandments 32Some ask Aren t there many of other faiths who love Christ Of course there are However as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints having a witness of His reality not only from the Bible but also from the Book of Mormon knowing His priesthood has been restored to the earth having made sacred covenants to follow Him and received the gift of the Holy Ghost having been endowed with power in His holy temple and being part of preparing for His glorious return to the earth we cannot compare what we are to be with those who have not yet received these truths Unto whom much is given much is required 33The Lord said Thou mayest choose for thyself 34I promise you as you choose not to be offended or ashamed you will feel His love and approval You will know that you are becoming more like Him 35Will we understand everything Of course not We will put some issues on the shelf to be understood at a later time Will everything be fair It will not We will accept some things we cannot fix and forgive others when it hurts Will we feel separated on occasion from those around us Absolutely Will we be astonished at times to see the anger a few feel toward the Lord s Church and their efforts to steal the struggling faith of the weak 36 Yes But this will not deter the growth or destiny of the Church nor need it impede the spiritual progress of each of us as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ Never Leave HimI love these words from a favorite hymn The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for reposeI will not I cannot desert to his foes That soul though all hell should endeavor to shake I ll never no never I ll never no never I ll never no never no never forsake 37Perfection does not come in this life but we exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and keep our covenants President Monson has promised Your testimony when constantly nourished will keep you safe 38 We push our spiritual roots deep feasting daily on the words of Christ in the scriptures We trust in the words of living prophets placed before us to show us the way We pray and pray and listen to the quiet voice of the Holy Ghost that leads us along and speaks peace to our soul Whatever challenges arise we never never leave Him The Savior asked His Apostles Will ye also go away 39Peter answered Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life We believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the living God 40I too have that witness I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
When you are assigned to speak at the end of the final session of general conference you listen to every word wondering which parts of your talk will be given before your turn comes There are no assigned subjects no collaboration of themes The Lord s way of course is always the best way He takes the individual prayerful efforts of each speaker and orchestrates a spiritual symphony full of revelation and power Repeated themes principle building upon principle prophetic warnings uplifting promises the divine harmony is a miracle I testify that in this conference we have heard and felt the mind and will of the Lord President Thomas S Monson has described the rising generation as the very best ever 1 and has said to our youth You have come to this earth at a glorious time The opportunities before you are nearly limitless 2 But he also warned We have been placed on earth in troubled times 3 It is a time of permissiveness with society in general routinely disregarding and breaking the laws of God 4 We are surrounded by so much that is designed to divert our attention The adversary is using every means possible to ensnare us in his web of deceit 5We hold in our arms the rising generation They come to this earth with important responsibilities and great spiritual capacities We cannot be casual in how we prepare them Our challenge as parents and teachers is not to create a spiritual core in their souls but rather to fan the flame of their spiritual core already aglow with the fire of their premortal faith This afternoon I wish to emphasize the plea of a child from a Primary song Tell me the stories of Jesus I love to hear Things I would ask him to tell me if he were here 6In our world today each child each young man and young woman needs his or her own conversion to the truth Each needs his or her own light his or her own steadfast and immovable 7 faith in the Lord Jesus Christ independent of parents youth leaders and supportive friends The stories of Jesus can be like a rushing wind across the embers of faith in the hearts of our children Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life 8The stories of Jesus shared over and over bring faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strength to the foundation of testimony Can you think of a more valuable gift for our children Are the life and teachings of Jesus Christ embedded in the minds and souls of our children Do they think about the Savior s life when they wonder what to do in their own lives This will be more and more important in the years ahead Have our children visualized the premortal council 9 where Jesus the greatest of all declared Here am I send me 10 Do they see their own willingness to serve as following His example Do they think about His humble birth 11 the Savior of the world lying in a manger 12 Do His circumstances help them better understand the proper place of material possessions Do they know that Jesus often taught Ask and ye shall receive 13 Do His prayers of thankfulness14 and His pleadings to His Father15 flow through our children s minds as they kneel in prayer with their own concerns Have we told them of the love Jesus has for children how He held them in His arms prayed for them and wept 16 Do our children know that Jesus stands ready with open arms to receive them 17Do they take strength in the stories of Jesus fasting18 as we teach them the law of the fast In their own loneliness do our children know the loneliness the Savior felt as His friends deserted Him and as He asked His Apostles Will ye also go away 19Have our children felt the power of the Savior s miracles Jesus healed the leper 20 gave sight to the blind 21 He fed the 5 000 22 calmed the sea 23 and raised Lazarus from the dead 24 Do our children believe that it is by faith that miracles are wrought 25 and do they pray for miracles in their own lives Have our children taken courage from the Savior s words to the ruler of the synagogue Be not afraid only believe 26Do our children know about His perfect life 27 His selfless ministry His betrayal and cruel Crucifixion 28 Have we testified to them of the certainty of His Resurrection 29 of His visit to the Nephites in the Americas 30 of His appearance to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove 31Do they anticipate His majestic return when all will be made right and every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ 32Do our children say Tell me the stories of Jesus I love to hear 33To the youth and children Live up to your important responsibilities and great spiritual capacities Seek to know more about Jesus open the scriptures One idea would be to read again the book of John and then discuss it with your parents teachers and each other To fathers and mothers to grandfathers and grandmothers and to those without children of their own who lovingly nurture children and youth my counsel is to speak more frequently about Jesus Christ In His holy name is great spiritual power There is no other name given nor any other way whereby salvation can come unto the children of men only in and through the name of Christ 34To mothers who are raising their children without a father in the home I promise you that as you speak of Jesus Christ you will feel the power of heaven blessing you After her husband passed away Sister Stella Oaks raised her three young children including Elder Dallin H Oaks35 as a single mother She once said I was given to know that the Lord loved me and that I would be made equal to my mission I felt an encircling love and knew he would sustain us through the opposition that would arise 36I make a special appeal to fathers Please be an important part of talking to your children about the Savior They need the confirming expressions of your faith along with those of their mother Although there may be times when a child does not listen with a believing heart your testimony of Jesus will remain in his or her mind and soul Do you remember the story of Alma who had chosen the wrong path Returning he said I remembered my father speaking concerning the coming of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the world As my mind caught hold upon this thought I cried within my heart O Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me 37If a child is not listening don t despair Time and truth are on your side At the right moment your words will return as if from heaven itself Your testimony will never leave your children As you reverently speak about the Savior in the car on the bus at the dinner table as you kneel in prayer during scripture study or in late night conversations the Spirit of the Lord will accompany your words 38As you do your best the testimony of Jesus will gently distill upon your children s hearts They will go to their Heavenly Father in humble prayer and feel His influence through the power of the Holy Ghost A stronger personal faith in Jesus Christ will prepare them for the challenges they will most surely face 39I met Bill Forrest and Debbie Hutchings when we were students at Brigham Young University Bill had returned from his mission He and Debbie fell in love and were married in the Oakland California Temple They established their home in Mesa Arizona and were blessed with five sons and two daughters Bill and Debbie taught their children to love the Lord Jesus Christ as they loved Him Their son Elder Daniel Forrest currently serving in the Mexico Oaxaca Mission said Every morning without fail we were there at the table before school reading and discussing the scriptures Their daughter Kara now married with two children of her own still vividly remembers her father driving her to early morning activities in high school She said My dad enjoyed committing quotes scriptures and poems to memory and during those early morning drives we would practice reciting them One of his favorite scriptures was Remember remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer who is Christ the Son of God that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds he shall have no power over you to drag you down because of the rock upon which ye are built 40On the Friday before Easter Sunday in the year 2000 exactly 10 years ago Bill Forrest was serving as bishop of the Estate Groves Ward in Arizona On his drive to work only a mile 1 6 km from home his car was struck by a large gravel truck Debbie and the children left home shortly after Bill and unexpectedly came upon the tragic scene Bill had not survived the accident The immortal spirit of this beloved husband and father had suddenly been taken home to Him who overcame death the Son of God whose glorious Resurrection they were to have celebrated together that Easter Sunday How did Debbie and her seven children the youngest only 5 find the strength they needed Kara 15 at the time of her father s accident recently told me I am grateful to my mother and father for the ways that they taught me about the Savior They opened the scriptures with me prayed with me and were examples of the Savior s charity love and patience Easter is a tender time in my life each year as I reflect on the life mission and Resurrection of our Savior and am reminded of the life of my earthly father Elder Daniel Forrest said I was 10 years old when my father passed away It was a tough time My mother has always been an example of the Savior s teachings I carry with me my father s name badge from his mission to Spain Two of my favorite quotes from my father are Two men can do anything as long as one of them is the Lord and The Savior must be our foundation Without that we flounder Faith in Jesus Christ has filled the hearts of the Forrest children On this Easter weekend 10 years since their father s passing they miss him deeply but the sting of his death is swallowed up in Christ 41 They know because of the incalculable gift of the Savior they can be with their earthly father and their Heavenly Father again Tell me the stories of Jesus In a moment we will hear from the prophet of God In speaking of His prophet the Lord said His word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth 42 I testify that President Thomas S Monson is the Lord s mouthpiece upon the earth I testify that Jesus is the Christ the Savior of all mankind His life His Atonement His Resurrection His awaited return are as sure and certain as the rising sun His name be praised forever and ever 43 In the holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters it has been six months since my call to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles To now serve with men who have long been my examples and teachers remains a very humbling experience I deeply appreciate your prayers and sustaining vote For me this has been a time of fervent prayer of earnestly seeking the acceptance of the Lord I have felt His love in sacred and unforgettable ways I testify that He lives and that this is His holy work We love President Thomas S Monson the Lord s prophet I will forever remember his kindness as he extended my call last April At the conclusion of our interview he opened his arms to embrace me President Monson is a tall man As he wrapped his long arms around me and pulled me close I felt like a little boy being held in the protective arms of a loving father In the months since that experience I have thought of the Lord s invitation to come unto Him and to spiritually be wrapped in His arms He said Behold my arms of mercy are extended towards you and whosoever will come him will I receive and blessed are those who come unto me 1The scriptures speak of His arms being open 2 extended 3 stretched out 4 and encircling 5 They are described as mighty6 and holy 7 arms of mercy 8 arms of safety 9 arms of love 10 lengthened out all the day long 11We have each felt to some extent these spiritual arms around us We have felt His forgiveness His love and comfort The Lord has said I am he who comforteth you 12The Lord s desire that we come unto Him and be wrapped in His arms is often an invitation to repent Behold he sendeth an invitation unto all men for the arms of mercy are extended towards them and he saith Repent and I will receive you 13When we sin we turn away from God When we repent we turn back toward God The invitation to repent is rarely a voice of chastisement but rather a loving appeal to turn around and to re turn toward God 14 It is the beckoning of a loving Father and His Only Begotten Son to be more than we are to reach up to a higher way of life to change and to feel the happiness of keeping the commandments Being disciples of Christ we rejoice in the blessing of repenting and the joy of being forgiven They become part of us shaping the way we think and feel Among the tens of thousands listening to this conference there are many degrees of personal worthiness and righteousness Yet repentance is a blessing to all of us We each need to feel the Savior s arms of mercy through the forgiveness of our sins Years ago I was asked to meet with a man who long before our visit had had a period of riotous living As a result of his bad choices he lost his membership in the Church He had long since returned to the Church and was faithfully keeping the commandments but his previous actions haunted him Meeting with him I felt his shame and his deep remorse at having set his covenants aside Following our interview I placed my hands upon his head to give him a priesthood blessing Before speaking a word I felt an overpowering sense of the Savior s love and forgiveness for him Following the blessing we embraced and the man wept openly I am amazed at the Savior s encircling arms of mercy and love for the repentant no matter how selfish the forsaken sin I testify that the Savior is able and eager to forgive our sins Except for the sins of those few who choose perdition after having known a fulness there is no sin that cannot be forgiven 15 What a marvelous privilege for each of us to turn away from our sins and to come unto Christ Divine forgiveness is one of the sweetest fruits of the gospel removing guilt and pain from our hearts and replacing them with joy and peace of conscience Jesus declares Will ye not now return unto me and repent of your sins and be converted that I may heal you 16Some listening today may need a mighty change of heart 17 to confront serious sins The help of a priesthood leader might be necessary For most repenting is quiet and quite private daily seeking the Lord s help to make needed changes For most repentance is more a journey than a one time event It is not easy To change is difficult It requires running into the wind swimming upstream Jesus said If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 18 Repentance is turning away from some things such as dishonesty pride anger and impure thoughts and turning toward other things such as kindness unselfishness patience and spirituality It is re turning toward God How do we decide where our repentance should be focused When a loved one or friend suggests things we need to change the natural man in us sometimes pops up his head and responds Oh you think I should change Well let me tell you about some of your problems A better approach is to humbly petition the Lord Father what wouldst Thou have me do The answers come We feel the changes we need to make The Lord tells us in our mind and in our heart 19We then are allowed to choose will we repent or will we pull the shades down over our open window into heaven Alma warned Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point 20 When we pull the shades down we stop believing that spiritual voice inviting us to change We pray but we listen less Our prayers lack that faith that leads to repentance 21At this very moment someone is saying Brother Andersen you don t understand You can t feel what I have felt It is too difficult to change You are correct I don t fully understand But there is One who does He knows He has felt your pain He has declared I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands 22 The Savior is there reaching out to each of us bidding us Come unto me 23 We can repent We can Realizing where we need to change we sorrow for the sadness we have caused This leads to sincere and heartfelt confession to the Lord and when needed to others 24 When possible we restore what we have wrongly harmed or taken Repentance becomes part of our daily lives Our weekly taking of the sacrament is so important to come meekly humbly before the Lord acknowledging our dependence upon Him asking Him to forgive and to renew us and promising to always remember Him Sometimes in our repentance in our daily efforts to become more Christlike we find ourselves repeatedly struggling with the same difficulties As if we were climbing a tree covered mountain at times we don t see our progress until we get closer to the top and look back from the high ridges Don t be discouraged If you are striving and working to repent you are in the process of repenting As we improve we see life more clearly and feel the Holy Ghost working more strongly within us Sometimes we wonder why we remember our sins long after we have forsaken them Why does the sadness for our mistakes at times continue following our repentance You will remember a tender story told by President James E Faust As a small boy on the farm I remember my grandmother cooking our delicious meals on a hot woodstove When the wood box next to the stove became empty Grandmother would silently pick up the box go out to refill it from the pile of cedar wood outside and bring the heavily laden box back into the house President Faust s voice then filled with emotion as he continued I was so insensitive I sat there and let my beloved grandmother refill the kitchen wood box I feel ashamed of myself and have regretted my sin of omission for all of my life I hope someday to ask for her forgiveness 25More than 65 years had passed If President Faust still remembered and regretted not helping his grandmother after all those years should we be surprised with some of the things we still remember and regret The scriptures do not say that we will forget our forsaken sins in mortality Rather they declare that the Lord will forget 26The forsaking of sins implies never returning Forsaking requires time To help us the Lord at times allows the residue of our mistakes to rest in our memory 27 It is a vital part of our mortal learning As we honestly confess our sins restore what we can to the offended and forsake our sins by keeping the commandments we are in the process of receiving forgiveness With time we will feel the anguish of our sorrow subside taking away the guilt from our hearts 28 and bringing peace of conscience 29For those who are truly repentant but seem unable to feel relief continue keeping the commandments I promise you relief will come in the timetable of the Lord Healing also requires time If you are concerned counsel with your bishop A bishop has the power of discernment 30 He will help you The scriptures warn us Do not procrastinate the day of your repentance 31 But in this life it is never too late to repent Once I was asked to meet an older couple returning to the Church They had been taught the gospel by their parents After their marriage they left the Church Now 50 years later they were returning I remember the husband coming into the office pulling an oxygen tank They expressed regret at not having remained faithful I told them of our happiness because of their return assuring them of the Lord s welcoming arms to those who repent The elderly man responded We know this Brother Andersen But our sadness is that our children and grandchildren do not have the blessings of the gospel We are back but we are back alone They were not back alone Repentance not only changes us but it also blesses our families and those we love With our righteous repentance in the timetable of the Lord the lengthened out arms of the Savior will not only encircle us but will also extend into the lives of our children and posterity Repentance always means that there is greater happiness ahead I bear witness that our Savior can deliver us from our sins I have personally felt His redeeming power I have unmistakably seen His healing hand upon thousands in nations throughout the world I testify that His divine gift removes guilt from our heart and brings peace to our conscience He loves us We are members of His Church He invites each of us to repent turn away from our sins and come unto Him I witness that He is there in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters across the world my knees are weak and my emotions close to the surface I express my love for you and profoundly thank you for your sustaining vote In so many dimensions I feel inadequate and humbled I take solace that in one qualification for the holy apostleship where there can be no latitude extended the Lord has deeply blessed me I do know with perfect and certain clarity through the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ the Beloved Son of God There is no man with more love than President Thomas S Monson His warmth is as the sunshine at midday Yet as he extended to me this sacred call you can imagine the overwhelming soberness I felt as the eyes of the prophet of God peered deeply into the chambers of my soul Happily you can also imagine the love I felt from the Lord and from His prophet as President Monson wrapped his long and loving arms around me I love you President Monson To those who know me if ever I have been less than I should have been in your presence I ask for your forgiveness and patience I so very much need your faith and prayers in my behalf I know that I am not what I must become I pray that I might be willing and moldable to the Lord s tutoring and correction I take comfort from the words of President Monson last night in the priesthood session that the Lord will shape the back to fit the burden placed upon it Just after my call as a General Authority 16 years ago in a stake conference where I accompanied President Boyd K Packer he said something I have not forgotten As he addressed the congregation he said I know who I am Then after a pause he added I am a nobody He then turned to me sitting on the stand behind him and said And Brother Andersen you are a nobody too Then he added these words If you ever forget it the Lord will remind you of it instantly and it won t be pleasant I express deep gratitude for you the faithful members of the Church As a young missionary in France I felt my testimony blossom as I witnessed members giving their full devotion for the gospel of Jesus Christ During the past 20 years we have lived 10 years outside of the United States on Church assignments In lands and languages different from my own I have seen the power of God at work in your lives How wonderful you are the great family of believers in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ The Lord has blessed me in ways I could never repay He allowed me to marry one of His angels here on earth My wife Kathy is my light and example a precious daughter of God full of purity and innocence I would be nothing without her For much of my life I have been trying to become what she thought I already was Twenty years ago when our four children were young our family was called to serve a mission in France With this and other calls that followed they found themselves moving from city to city continent to continent during those years that plead for stability The Lord has now richly blessed them with wonderful companions and choice children of their own I want to thank them for their goodness and for their sacrifices in my behalf I am also grateful for my faithful parents my mother is here today and for all those who have done so much for me throughout my life I express my deep respect and love for my Brethren of the Seventy I love them as I love my own brother Our bond and friendship is not just of this world but will move with us through the veil For 16 years the members of the First Presidency and the Twelve have been my examples and teachers I have learned from their integrity and righteousness In these many years I have never observed any unbridled anger any desire for private or material gain Never have I seen any personal positioning for influence or power Rather I have seen their loyalty and care for their wives and children I have experienced their love and sure witness of our Heavenly Father and His Son I have watched them untiringly seek first to build up the kingdom of God I have seen the power of God rest upon them and magnify and sustain them I have witnessed the fulfillment of their prophetic voice I have seen the sick raised and nations blessed through their authority and have stood with them in moments too sacred to recount I testify that they are the Lord s anointed I pray that my spirit might be like that of Elder Joseph B Wirthlin whose passing brought about this call a spirit void of any desire for personal attention willing to go anywhere and do anything the Lord s prophets would have me do applying my full consecration in testifying of the Savior and building the kingdom of God until my final breath Our days are days long anticipated in the history of the world The scriptures speak of things the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world D C 128 5 The revelations tell of a great gathering that will take place see 2 Nephi 10 7 8 3 Nephi 16 5 Isaiah prophesied that the house of the Lord would be established in the tops of the mountains and that the voice of the Lord would go from there to the whole earth see Isaiah 2 2 3 Daniel declared that it would be as a stone cut out of a mountain without hands see Daniel 2 34 44 45 Peter spoke of the restitution of all things see Acts 3 20 21 Nephi saw that those of the Church of the Lamb would not be many in number but would be in every land and nation see 1 Nephi 14 12 14 We live in these days of the Lord s marvellous work and a wonder Isaiah 29 14 see 2 Nephi 25 17 We have been blessed to bring the gospel to our families and our posterity and to assist in preparing for the Second Coming of the Savior The Lord described the purposes of the Restoration to be a light to the world to be a standard for us His people and to be a messenger before His face to prepare the way before Him D C 45 9 Our responsibility is not trivial it is not by chance that we are who we are the keeping of our covenants in these days of destiny will be a badge of honor throughout all the eternities I have been privileged to see the Lord s hand at work across the world While we honor those pioneers who walked across the plains to the Salt Lake Valley there are far more pioneers living today They don t push handcarts but they are exactly the same in so many ways They have heard the voice of the Lord through the Book of Mormon and through their personal prayers With faith and repentance they have stepped into the waters of baptism and firmly planted their feet in the rich gospel soil As disciples of Christ they have been willing to sacrifice for what is right and true And with the gift of the Holy Ghost they are holding steady in their course toward eternal life We must remember my dear brothers and sisters who we are and what we have in our hands We are not alone in our desire to do good there are wonderful people of many faiths and beliefs We are not alone in praying to our Heavenly Father or in receiving answers to our prayers our Father loves all of His children We are not alone in sacrificing for a greater cause there are others who are unselfish Others share our faith in Christ There are loyal and decent fathers and mothers in every land who love each other and love their children There is much we can learn from the good people all around us Yet we must not shrink from what is uniquely and singularly found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Only here is the priesthood of God restored to earth by heavenly messengers Only here does the Book of Mormon stand with the Bible in revealing and declaring the full divinity and gospel of Christ Only here are there prophets of God bringing guidance from heaven and holding the keys that bind in heaven what is bound on earth Our knowledge of the divine mission of the Church should not bring feelings of superiority or arrogance but should take us to our knees pleading for the Lord s help that we might be what we should be But in humility we need not be timid in remembering the Lord s words This is my church and I will establish it and nothing shall overthrow it Mosiah 27 13 Above all we proclaim our Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ All that we are all that we will ever be we owe to Him While we gaze in awe at His majesty He does not ask us to stay our distance but bids us to come unto Him I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him Revelation 3 20 His words echo through the centuries I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die John 11 25 26 Brothers and sisters He lives He is resurrected He guides His holy work upon the earth His prophet is President Thomas S Monson I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I rejoice with you in being members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints As President Monson shared the wonderful news of five new temples I thought how across the world on every continent in large cities and in small villages we are a great family of believers Together we have begun our march toward eternal life It is the journey of journeys We go forward taking upon us the name of Christ having a determination to serve him to the end 1While there are many experiences like the one we are having today full of spiritual power and confirmation there are also days when we feel inadequate and unprepared when doubt and confusion enter our spirits when we have difficulty finding our spiritual footing Part of our victory as disciples of Christ is what we do when these feelings come Nearly 40 years ago as I contemplated the challenge of a mission I felt very inadequate and unprepared I remember praying Heavenly Father how can I serve a mission when I know so little I believed in the Church but I felt my spiritual knowledge was very limited As I prayed the feeling came You don t know everything but you know enough That reassurance gave me the courage to take the next step into the mission field Our spiritual journey is the process of a lifetime We do not know everything in the beginning or even along the way Our conversion comes step by step line upon line We first build a foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ We treasure the principles and ordinances of repentance baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost We include a continuing commitment to prayer a willingness to be obedient and an ongoing witness of the Book of Mormon The Book of Mormon is powerful spiritual nourishment We then remain steady and patient as we progress through mortality At times the Lord s answer will be You don t know everything but you know enough enough to keep the commandments and to do what is right Remember Nephi s words I know that he loveth his children nevertheless I do not know the meaning of all things 2I once visited a mission in southern Europe I arrived on the day a new missionary was preparing to return home at his own insistence He had his ticket to leave the next day We sat together in the mission president s home The missionary told me about his challenging childhood of learning disorders of moving from one family to another He spoke sincerely of his inability to learn a new language and adapt to a new culture Then he added Brother Andersen I don t even know if God loves me As he said those words I felt a sure and forceful feeling come into my spirit He does know I love him He knows it I let him continue for a few more minutes and then I said Elder I m sympathetic to much of what you ve said but I must correct you on one thing you do know God loves you You know He does As I said those words to him the same Spirit that had spoken to me spoke to him He bowed his head and began to cry He apologized Brother Andersen he said I do know God loves me I do know it He didn t know everything but he knew enough He knew God loved him That priceless piece of spiritual knowledge was sufficient for his doubt to be replaced with faith He found the strength to stay on his mission Brothers and sisters we each have moments of spiritual power moments of inspiration and revelation We must sink them deep into the chambers of our souls As we do we prepare our spiritual home storage for moments of personal difficulty Jesus said Settle this in your hearts that ye will do the things which I shall teach and command you 3Several years ago a friend of mine had a young daughter die in a tragic accident Hopes and dreams were shattered My friend felt unbearable sorrow He began to question what he had been taught and what he had taught as a missionary The mother of my friend wrote me a letter and asked if I would give him a blessing As I laid my hands upon his head I felt to tell him something that I had not thought about in exactly the same way before The impression that came to me was Faith is not only a feeling it is a decision He would need to choose faith My friend did not know everything but he knew enough He chose the road of faith and obedience He got on his knees His spiritual balance returned It has been several years since that event A short time ago I received a letter from his son who is now serving a mission It was full of conviction and testimony As I read his beautiful letter I saw how a father s choice of faith in a very difficult time had deeply blessed the next generation Challenges difficulties questions doubts these are part of our mortality But we are not alone As disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ we have enormous spiritual reservoirs of light and truth available to us Fear and faith cannot coexist in our hearts at the same time In our days of difficulty we choose the road of faith Jesus said Be not afraid only believe 4Through the years we take these important spiritual steps over and over again We begin to see that he that receiveth light and continueth in God receiveth more light and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day 5 Our questions and doubts are resolved or become less concerning to us Our faith becomes simple and pure We come to know what we already knew Jesus said Except ye become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven 6Hadley Peay is now seven years old Hadley was born with a very serious hearing impairment requiring extensive surgery to bring even limited hearing Her parents followed with tireless training to help her learn to speak Hadley and her family have cheerfully adapted to the challenge of her deafness Once when Hadley was four she was standing in the checkout line at the grocery store with her mother She looked behind her and saw a little boy sitting in a wheelchair She noticed that the boy did not have legs Although Hadley had learned to speak she had difficulty controlling the volume of her voice In her louder voice she asked her mother why the little boy did not have legs Her mother quietly and simply explained to Hadley that Heavenly Father makes all of His children different OK Hadley replied Then unexpectedly Hadley turned to the little boy and said Did you know that when Heavenly Father made me my ears did not work That makes me special He made you with no legs and that makes you special When Jesus comes I will be able to hear and you will get your legs Jesus will make everything all right Except ye become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven Hadley knew enough Jesus is the Christ He is resurrected He is our Savior and Redeemer All will be made well when He comes again This is His holy work Through the Prophet Joseph Smith His priesthood was restored upon the earth and His prophet today is President Thomas S Monson I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I take as my subject today something President Hinckley said in general conference in April of 1973 I had just returned home from my mission So much seemed ahead of me Would I be able to consistently make the right choices throughout my life Then Elder Gordon B Hinckley spoke of meeting a young naval officer from Asia The officer had not been a Christian but during training in the United States he had learned about the Church and was baptized He was now preparing to return to his native land President Hinckley asked the officer Your people are not Christians What will happen when you return home a Christian and more particularly a Mormon Christian The officer s face clouded and he replied My family will be disappointed As for my future and my career all opportunity may be foreclosed against me President Hinckley asked Are you willing to pay so great a price for the gospel With his dark eyes moistened by tears he answered with a question It s true isn t it President Hinckley responded Yes it is true To which the officer replied Then what else matters 1Through the years I have reflected on these words It s true isn t it Then what else matters These questions have helped me put difficult issues in proper perspective The cause in which we are laboring is true We respect the beliefs of our friends and neighbors We are all sons and daughters of God We can learn much from other men and women of faith and goodness as President Faust taught us so well Yet we know that Jesus is the Christ He is resurrected In our day through the Prophet Joseph Smith the priesthood of God has been restored We have the gift of the Holy Ghost The Book of Mormon is what we claim it to be The promises of the temple are certain The Lord Himself has declared the unique and singular mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints to be a light to the world and a messenger to prepare the way before Him 2 even as the gospel roll s forth unto the ends of the earth 3It s true isn t it Then what else matters Of course for all of us there are other things that matter When I heard President Hinckley s talk as a 21 year old I needed to be serious about my studies I needed employment to keep me in school somehow I had to figure out how to convince a special young lady that she should take a chance on me and I enjoyed other worthy activities How do we find our way through the many things that matter We simplify and purify our perspective Some things are evil and must be avoided some things are nice some things are important and some things are absolutely essential The Savior said This is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent 4Faith is not only a feeling it is a decision With prayer study obedience and covenants we build and fortify our faith Our conviction of the Savior and His latter day work becomes the powerful lens through which we judge all else Then as we find ourselves in the crucible of life as Elder Oaks explained we have the strength to take the right course President Hinckley said it this way When an individual is motivated by great and powerful convictions of truth then he disciplines himself not because of demands made by the Church but because of the knowledge within his heart 5Are we sufficiently motivated by great and powerful convictions of truth Do our choices reflect this motivation Are we becoming who we want to become It s true isn t it Then what else matters We know what is right A few years ago my wife Kathy was with our grandchildren while their parents were away Our four year old grandson gave his little brother a strong push After consoling the crying child she turned to the four year old and thoughtfully asked Why would you push your little brother He looked at his grandmother and responded Mimi I m sorry I lost my CTR ring and I cannot choose the right We need to be careful because excuses can impede our progress Great and powerful convictions of truth are found in the hearts of Latter day Saints in nations across the world This strength of faith carries the work of the kingdom forward Many years ago my wife and I stood by a courageous sister in France as her husband still in his 30s passed through the veil The responsibility to righteously teach and guide her four young children alone seemed overwhelming Yet 16 years later her three sons have returned from missions and her daughter is sealed in the temple I know a brother in Brazil who joined the Church as a 16 year old the only member in his family When it was time for his mission his parents objected He heard nothing from them during his mission and returned home to his bishop s house The story however has a happy ending as he now has a beautiful family works as a dental surgeon and his parents wish he could interest his brothers in the Church I know a brother in a Latin American country who after his baptism determined he would not only be honest in his tithing but would also fully pay his taxes something his competitors did not do The Lord blessed him for his honesty Many sacrifices are quietly accomplished returned missionaries not delaying the responsibility of finding their eternal companion righteous women desiring children and investing their lives in rearing them in love and truth families carefully restricting the media and Internet influences that would tarnish their spirits husbands and wives finding more time to be in the temple together Children can also develop this lens of faith I recently met youth in Seoul Korea who because of a rigorous school schedule do not arrive home until very late each night yet attend early morning seminary at 6 00 a m five days a week I know an eight year old baseball player a star of the team who on his own explained to his coach that he could not participate in the final playoff game because it was to be held on Sunday Many of the quiet acts of deep faith are known only to God But they are recorded in heaven It s true isn t it Then what else matters The Savior said Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you 6I testify that it is true and that it does matter In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Tonight I speak to you young men you whom President Gordon B Hinckley has described as the finest generation 1 Across the world we see your goodness I pray that you will feel that my words are personally for you a son of God working hard to do what s right I d like to tell you of an experience of a faithful Latter day Saint who is a good friend of mine I ll refer to him only as my friend for reasons you will understand Working as a special agent for the FBI my friend investigated organized crime groups transporting illegal drugs into the United States On one occasion he and another agent approached an apartment where they believed a known drug dealer was distributing cocaine My friend describes what happened We knocked on the door of the drug dealer The suspect opened the door and upon seeing us tried to block our view But it was too late we could see the cocaine on his table A man and a woman who were at the table immediately began removing the cocaine We had to prevent them from destroying the evidence so I quickly pushed the drug suspect who was blocking the door to the side As I pushed him my eyes met his Strangely he did not appear angry or afraid He was smiling at me His eyes and disarming smile gave me the impression that he was harmless so I quickly left him and started to move toward the table The suspect was now behind me At that instant I had the distinct powerful impression come into my mind Beware of the evil behind the smiling eyes I immediately turned back toward the suspect His hand was in his large front pocket Instinctively I grabbed his hand and pulled it from his pocket Only then did I see clutched in his hand the semiautomatic pistol ready to fire A flurry of activity followed and I disarmed the man 2Later in another case the drug dealer was convicted of murder and boasted that he would have also killed my friend had he not turned around at that very moment I have often thought of the communication that came into his mind Beware of the evil behind the smiling eyes This is what I want to talk to you about tonight Let s begin with what we know Good comes from God evil comes from the devil 3 They are not however equal forces that are fighting each other in the universe At the head of all that is good is the Christ He who is the Only Begotten of the Father who created our world and numerous others Our Redeemer is a resurrected and perfect being 4 I know He lives The devil on the other hand persuadeth men to do evil 5 He has fallen from heaven has become miserable forever 6 and now works that all men might be miserable like unto himself 7 He is a liar and a loser 8The power of the Savior and the power of the devil are not truly comparable 9 On this planet however evil has been allowed a position of influence to give us the chance to choose between good and evil The scripture says God gave unto man that he should act for himself And man could not act for himself unless he was enticed by one or the other 10The choice between good and evil is at the very heart of our experience on earth In the final review of our lives it will not really matter if we were rich or poor if we were athletic or not if we had friends or were often forgotten We can work study laugh and have fun dance sing and enjoy many different experiences These are a wonderful part of life but they are not central to why we are here 11 The opportunity to choose good over evil is precisely why we are here 12Not one of us would say I want to choose evil We all want to choose the right However the choice of good over evil is not always easy because evil frequently lurks behind smiling eyes Listen to these warnings Take heed that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God 13 Ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation for Satan desireth to have you 14 Satan hath sought to deceive you that he might overthrow you 15The message is Beware of the evil behind the smiling eyes I have known a few young men who began with every intention to stay firm in their loyalty to the Savior but who slipped from the path because they did not see the evil behind eyes that appeared quite harmless They saw the fun the pleasure the acceptance but they did not see the other consequences How then can we discern the evil behind something that doesn t appear evil You already know the answers but here are a few thoughts First talk to your parents Does that sound like a revolutionary idea We fathers know we are far from perfect but we love you and along with your mothers have a deep interest in your choosing the right Next follow the prophet These 15 men we sustain as prophets seers and revelators are given divine power to see what we sometimes do not see President Hinckley has given us clear and specific counsel about the evil behind the smiling eyes 16 And you have the inspired guidance in the booklet For the Strength of Youth 17 As you apply President Hinckley s counsel the Lord has promised that He will disperse the powers of darkness from before you 18 You will see the evil behind the smiling eyes and its appeal will leave you Very importantly let the Holy Ghost be your guide The Lord has promised us that as we live righteously the still small voice will come into our mind and into our heart 19 You have felt this influence You know this voice 20The gift of the Holy Ghost is a spiritual gift It is sensitive and will not be associated with unworthiness You cannot offend or ignore it one day and expect it to strengthen you the next day But as you heed its promptings and remain righteous it will grow stronger within you The Holy Ghost warned my friend of physical danger the Holy Ghost will also warn you of spiritual danger Finally gain your own testimony of the Savior Pray passionately Read the Book of Mormon when no one is watching Take time alone to think about who Jesus really is and how His life and sacrifice are important to you Remember the example of the young Joseph Smith When he lit the candle at night to read the Bible it was because he wanted to When he went into the grove to pray he went alone 21As we increase our understanding and love for the Savior His light will illuminate everything around us We then will see evil for what it is 22I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior Words cannot describe His greatness and glory His majesty and magnificence He appeared with His Father to the Prophet Joseph Smith President Gordon B Hinckley is the prophet of God today Brethren we hold His holy priesthood As we remain worthy we will be blessed to see the evil behind the smiling eyes I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I express my love to you this morning I speak to the devoted and testimony filled members of the Church spread across the nations of the earth The very fact that on this beautiful Saturday morning you are here in the Tabernacle or watching this conference in some other darkened room in the middle of the day speaks to your discipleship You are serious about what you believe and it shows in your life One admonition that has been a strength to me is the powerful declaration of the Prophet Joshua Choose you this day whom ye will serve but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord Josh 24 15 The words of Joshua ring with such relevance today and yet how we demonstrate our decision to serve the Lord seems to change with each generation Thirty five hundred years ago as Joshua spoke it meant leaving behind false gods going to battle against the Canaanites and following with sharp attention the words of the Prophet We can almost hear the whining of the skeptics as Joshua announced his battle plans for taking the city of Jericho First he said they would quietly without any speaking circle the city one time for each of six days Then on the seventh day they would compass the city seven times Following the priests would blow the trumpets and at that time all the people would shout with a great shout Then Joshua assured them the walls would come down see Josh 6 When the walls came down the skeptics were quiet In our world today one thing has not changed since Joshua spoke Those who choose to serve the Lord will always listen attentively and specifically to the Prophet In modern Israel serving the Lord means carefully following the Prophets The challenges that face us and our families as disciples of Christ are somewhat different than those of Joshua s Israelites Let me illustrate with an experience Our family lived for many years in the state of Florida Because Florida has a high concentration of sand lawns there are planted with a large broadleaf grass we call Saint Augustine A formidable enemy of a Florida lawn is a small brown insect called a mole cricket One evening as my neighbor and I stood on the front steps he noticed a little bug crossing my sidewalk You better spray your lawn he warned There goes a mole cricket I had sprayed the lawn with insecticide not too many weeks previously and I hardly felt that I had the time or money to do it again so soon In the light of the next morning I examined my lawn closely It was lush and beautifully green I looked down into the grass to see if I could see any of the little bugs I could see none I remember thinking Well maybe that little mole cricket was just passing through my yard on the way to my neighbor s yard I watched my lawn for more than a week looking for signs of invaders but none was evident I congratulated myself that I had not overreacted to my neighbor s warning The story however has a sad ending I came out the front door one morning about 10 days after the conversation with my neighbor Shockingly as if it had happened overnight brown spots covered my lawn I ran to the garden store bought the insecticide and sprayed immediately but it was too late The lawn was ruined and to return it to its former state required a new crop of sod long hours of work and large expense My neighbor s warning was central to my lawn s welfare He saw things I could not see He knew something I did not know He knew that mole crickets live underground and are active only at night making my daytime examinations ineffective He knew that mole crickets did not eat the leaves of the grass but rather found nourishment in the roots He knew that these little inch long creatures could eat a lot of roots before I would ever see the effect above the ground I paid a dear price for my smug independence We live in a wonderful day The blessings of our generation are lush and beautifully green With faith in the Savior and obedience to the commandments our lives can be full of satisfaction and joy Yet in these days of much beauty our challenges in choosing to serve the Lord are more subtle than those of former days but without question they are as spiritually pervasive There are spiritual mole crickets that burrow under our protective walls and invade our delicate roots Many of these insects of wickedness appear small at times almost invisible Yet if we do not combat them they will do damage and attempt to destroy that which is most precious to us The warnings of the Prophets and Apostles lead them ever and always to speak of the home and family Let me demonstrate the warning voice of the Prophets On February 11 of this year the First Presidency with the support of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles sent to every member of the Church a letter of counsel concerning our families Let me read you just two sentences from this letter We counsel parents and children to give highest priority to family prayer family home evening gospel study and instruction and wholesome family activities However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be they must not be permitted to displace the divinely appointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform Policies Announcements and Appointments Ensign June 1999 80 What is our reaction to this prophetic counsel What has been my response and your response to this First Presidency letter of nearly eight months ago As a parent of teenagers in a busy world I can confirm that it takes giving these issues our highest priority to see them effectively work in our family We have just heard the beautiful story of Elder Featherstone and family prayer With the influences of evil that surround our children can we even imagine sending them out in the morning without kneeling and humbly asking together for the Lord s protection Or closing the day without kneeling together and acknowledging our accountability before Him and our thankfulness for His blessings Brothers and sisters we need to have family prayer Certainly there are times when getting the family together to read the scriptures does not stack up as a spiritual experience worthy of a journal entry But we must not be deterred There are special times when the spirit of a son or daughter is just right and the power of these great scriptures goes down into their heart like fire As we honor our Heavenly Father in our homes He will honor our efforts We all know the struggle necessary to retain family home evening There are thieves among us who would steal our Monday nights But the promises of the Lord made to families who hold family home evening that were spoken by the First Presidency 84 years ago and reiterated by our Prophets today have never been revoked and are there for us If the Saints obey this counsel we promise that great blessings will result Love at home and obedience to parents will increase Faith will be developed in the hearts of the youth of Israel and they will gain power to combat the evil influence and temptations which beset them in James R Clark comp Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 6 vols 1965 75 4 339 Who within the sound of my voice would be willing to sell these promises to those who would confiscate our Monday nights Not one of us For you and me the disciples of Christ these moments of building faith in the lives of our children must be strengthened We will at times fall short as parents I know I do But we must begin again The Lord sees our righteous efforts and will open the blessings of heaven as we give our families our highest priority My brothers and sisters there are spiritual mole crickets at work on our roots and we must be even more serious in our family stewardship As we participate in this conference let us listen attentively to our dear President Hinckley his Counselors and the Apostles who address us Let us not follow the pattern I showed in dealing with my Florida mole crickets Let us never ignore the warnings Let us never be smug in our independence Let us always be listening and learning in humility and faith anxious to repent should it be necessary This is the kingdom of God upon the earth You and I are disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ He is the Son of God He lives He directs this work President Hinckley is His Prophet and with him are 14 others who hold the Apostolic keys They are watchmen on the tower messengers of the warning voice Prophets Seers and Revelators Choose you this day whom ye will serve but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord Josh 24 15 And the people said unto Joshua The Lord our God will we serve and his voice will we obey Josh 24 24 That these words may be written in our hearts is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters words are so inadequate to express how humble and overwhelmed I feel at receiving this special calling Throughout my life as I have heard the General Authorities speak and felt the power of their messages I have gained a great reverence for the sacred role they perform in the Church Now to be invited to sit with them and to assist them in building the kingdom of God is a privilege I feel faint in accepting I pray for your support for your faith and prayers that I might measure up I ask for your patience and for the patience of my Brethren who will be my tutors More than anything I pray for the help of our Heavenly Father and his Son for without their help and direction I will surely fail I am grateful for my wonderful companion Kathy She makes goodness look easy and the purity of her spirit keeps our family focused on the simple yet saving truths of the gospel I m so thankful for the valiant and precious children that have been entrusted to us I love them dearly and appreciate so much their willingness to support me in this new calling I have been blessed with goodly parents My parents are now serving as proselyting missionaries in the Georgia Macon Mission Even before I knew I knew that they knew the Church was true I am so appreciative of Kathy s parents and their example of unselfish giving and for our brothers and sisters who live the gospel in quiet yet dedicated ways Our family returned nine months ago from a mission in southern France I want to express my great love for the members in France It was in France twenty years ago that I began to glimpse what seeking first the kingdom of God really meant And living among these French Saints during the last three years has motivated our family to a much greater consecration I am so grateful for the tremendous missionaries who served there with us and taught us that uncompromising faith will always prevail in a doubting and cynical world Finally I am thankful for the good Saints and members in our home state of Florida who have strengthened us through our many years there together I have heard President Monson say Whom the Lord calls the Lord qualifies I know this is true and it gives me hope looking beyond my own inadequacies I know that when we are on the Lord s errand he will be with us he will strengthen us he will build our capacities I have experienced it I have felt his lifting Spirit In the months and years ahead I will need him so very much I pledge all that I am to this sacred calling I promise to be teachable and I pray that I can be sufficiently meek that the Lord can mold and strengthen my spirit to accomplish his purposes I commit to you and to the Lord that I will consecrate myself to advancing the cause of the Restoration and to loyally following his chosen leaders I know that our Heavenly Father lives and that he loves each one of us I know that Jesus is the Christ and that he lovingly offers the way to our forgiveness I know that through the Prophet Joseph Smith the church of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth and that the true priesthood authority of God is in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I pray that I may always be valiant in that testimony and to these eternal truths in the name of Jesus Christ amen
