While meeting with the elders of the Church on one occasion the Prophet Joseph Smith declared Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion We have none 1 My dear brothers and sisters following the First Vision the miraculous coming forth of the Book of Mormon is the second fundamental milestone of the unfolding Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in this dispensation The Book of Mormon testifies of God s love for His children of the Lord Jesus Christ s selfless and divine atoning sacrifice and of His crowning ministry among the Nephites soon after His Resurrection 2 It also testifies that the remnant of the house of Israel is to become one through His latter day work and that they are not cast off forever 3As we study the coming forth of this holy book of scripture in these latter days we come to realize that the entire undertaking was miraculous from the Prophet Joseph receiving the gold plates from a holy angel to its translation by the gift and power of God 4 its preservation and its publication by the hand of the Lord The coming forth of the Book of Mormon began long before Joseph Smith received the gold plates from the hands of the angel Moroni Prophets of old prophesied about this sacred book s advent in our day 5 Isaiah spoke of a sealed book that when it would appear people would be contending over God s word This circumstance would provide the context wherein God could perform His marvellous work and a wonder causing the wisdom of their wise men to perish and the understanding of their prudent men to be hid while the meek would increase their joy in the Lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel 6 Ezekiel spoke about the stick of Judah the Bible and the stick of Ephraim the Book of Mormon being brought together as one Both Ezekiel in the Old Testament and Lehi in the Book of Mormon indicate that they shall grow together to confound false doctrine establish peace and bring us to a knowledge of the covenants 7In the evening of September 21 1823 three and a half years after experiencing the First Vision Joseph was visited three times by the angel Moroni the last prophet of the Nephites in ancient America as a result of his sincere prayers During their visits that lasted through the night Moroni told Joseph that God had a marvelous work for him to accomplish the translation and publication to the world of the inspired words of ancient prophets of the American continent 8 The next day Joseph went to the place not far from his home where the plates were buried by Moroni at the end of his life centuries earlier There Joseph saw Moroni again who instructed him to prepare himself to receive the plates in the future Over the next four years on September 22 of each year Joseph received additional instructions from Moroni regarding the knowledge about how the Lord s kingdom should be governed in the latter days Joseph s preparation also included visits from the angels of God thus unfolding the majesty and glory of the events that would take place in this dispensation 9His marriage to Emma Hale in 1827 was part of that preparation She played an important role in helping the Prophet throughout his life and ministry In fact in September 1827 Emma accompanied Joseph to the hill where the plates were hidden and she waited for him as the angel Moroni delivered the record into Joseph s hands Joseph received the promise that the plates would be preserved if he would devote all his efforts to keep them safe until they should be returned into the hands of Moroni 10My dear fellow companions in the gospel many of today s discoveries from ancient times occur during an archaeological excavation or even by accident during a construction project Joseph Smith however was directed to the plates by an angel That outcome by itself was a miracle The translation process of the Book of Mormon was also a miracle This sacred ancient record was not translated in the traditional way that scholars would translate ancient texts by learning an ancient language We ought to look at the process more like a revelation with the aid of physical instruments provided by the Lord as opposed to a translation by one with knowledge of languages Joseph Smith declared that through God s power he translated the Book of Mormon from hieroglyphs the knowledge of which was lost to the world in which wonderful event he stood alone an unlearned youth to combat the worldly wisdom and multiplied ignorance of eighteen centuries with a new revelation 11 The Lord s help in the translation of the plates or revelation so to speak is also evident when considering the miraculously short time Joseph Smith took to translate them 12Joseph s scribes testified of the power of God that was manifested while working on the translation of the Book of Mormon Oliver Cowdery once said These were days never to be forgotten to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom Day after day I continued uninterrupted to write from his mouth as he translated The Book of Mormon 13Historical sources reveal that from the moment Joseph obtained the plates in 1827 attempts were made to steal them from him He noted that the most strenuous exertions were used to get the plates from him and that every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose 14 Eventually Joseph and Emma were forced to move from Manchester New York to Harmony Pennsylvania to find a safe place to proceed with the work of translation away from mobs and individuals who wanted to steal the plates 15 As one historian notes Thus ended the first difficult phase of Joseph s guardianship over the plates Yet the record was safe and in his struggles to preserve them Joseph no doubt had learned much about the ways of God and man that would serve him well in the time to come 16While translating the Book of Mormon Joseph learned that the Lord would choose witnesses to see the plates 17 This is part of what the Lord Himself established when He said In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established 18 Oliver Cowdery David Whitmer and Martin Harris who were some of Joseph s initial companions in the establishment of God s marvelous work in this dispensation were the first witnesses called to bear a special testimony of the Book of Mormon to the world They testified that an angel who came from the presence of the Lord showed them the ancient record and that they saw the characters engraved in the plates They also testified that they heard the voice of God from heaven declaring that the ancient record was translated by the gift and power of God Then they were commanded to testify of it to the entire world 19The Lord miraculously called another eight witnesses to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon to the world They testified that they saw and carefully examined the plates and their engraved characters Even amid the adversities persecutions all kinds of difficulties and even some of them later faltering in their faith these eleven chosen Book of Mormon witnesses never denied their testimonies that they had seen the plates Joseph Smith was not alone anymore with the knowledge of Moroni s visits and the gold plates Lucy Mack Smith recorded that her son arrived home overcome with joy after the witnesses were shown the plates Joseph explained to his parents I feel as if I was relieved of a burden which was almost too heavy for me to bear and it rejoices my soul that I am not any longer to be entirely alone in the world 20Joseph Smith faced much opposition in printing the Book of Mormon as its translation came to an end He was able to convince a printer named Egbert B Grandin in Palmyra New York to print it only after Martin Harris in an act of great faith and sacrifice mortgaged his farm as collateral for the printing costs Due in part to the continuing opposition after the publication of the Book of Mormon Martin Harris faithfully sold 151 acres 0 6 km2 of his farm to pay off the publication costs Through a revelation given to Joseph Smith the Lord instructed Martin Harris to not covet his property and pay the printing cost for the book that contains the truth and the word of God 21 In March 1830 the first 5 000 copies of the Book of Mormon were published and today more than 180 million copies have been printed in over a hundred languages The historical facts and the special witnesses of the Book of Mormon testify that its coming forth was indeed miraculous Nevertheless the power of this book is not based only in its magnificent history but on its powerful unparalleled message that has changed countless lives including mine I read the entire Book of Mormon for the first time when I was a young seminary student As recommended by my teachers I started reading it beginning with its introduction pages The promise contained in the first pages of the Book of Mormon still echoes in my mind Ponder in your hearts and then ask God in faith in the name of Christ if the book is true Those who pursue this course will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost 22With that promise in mind earnestly seeking to know more about the truth of it and in a spirit of prayer I studied the Book of Mormon little by little as I completed the weekly assigned seminary lessons I remember like it was yesterday that a warm feeling gradually began swelling in my soul and filling my heart enlightening my understanding and becoming more and more delightful as described by Alma in his preaching the word of God to his people 23 That feeling eventually turned into knowledge that took root in my heart and became the foundation of my testimony of the significant events and teachings found in this sacred book Through these and other priceless personal experiences the Book of Mormon indeed became the keystone that sustains my faith in Jesus Christ and my testimony of the doctrine of His gospel It became one of the pillars that testifies to me of Christ s divine atoning sacrifice It became a shield throughout my life against the adversary s attempts to weaken my faith and instill disbelief in my mind and gives me courage to boldly declare my testimony of the Savior to the world My dear friends my testimony of the Book of Mormon came line upon line24 as a miracle to my heart To this day this testimony continues to grow as I continuously search with a sincere heart to more fully understand the word of God as contained in this extraordinary book of scripture To all who hear my voice today I invite you to be part of the marvelous coming forth of the Book of Mormon in your own life I promise you that as you prayerfully and consistently study its words you can partake of its promises and rich blessings in your life I reaffirm once more the promise that echoes through its pages that if you ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ if these things are not true and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ He mercifully will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost 25 I can assure you that He will give you the answer in a very personal way as He has done for me and many others around the world Your experience will be as glorious and sacred for you as Joseph Smith s experiences were for him as well as for the first witnesses and for all who have sought to receive a witness of the integrity and trustworthiness of this sacred book I bear my witness that the Book of Mormon is indeed the word of God I testify that this sacred record puts forth the doctrines of the gospel outlines the plan of salvation and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come 26 I testify that the Book of Mormon is God s instrument to bring about the gathering of Israel in our day and to help people come to know His Son Jesus Christ I testify that God lives and loves us and His Son Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world the chief cornerstone of our religion I say these things in the sacred name of our Redeemer our Master and our Lord even Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters we have received wonderful teachings from our leaders during these last two days I testify to you that if we strive to apply these inspired and timely teachings in our lives the Lord through His grace will help each of us carry our cross and make our burdens light 1While in the vicinity of Caesarea Philippi the Savior revealed to His disciples what He would suffer at the hands of the elders chief priests and scribes in Jerusalem He specifically taught them about His death and glorious Resurrection 2 At that point in time His disciples did not completely understand His divine mission on earth Peter himself when he heard what the Savior had said took Him aside and rebuked Him saying Be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee 3To help His disciples to understand that devotion to His work includes submission and suffering the Savior emphatically declared If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me For whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul 4Through this declaration the Savior emphasized that all those who are willing to follow Him need to deny themselves and control their desires appetites and passions sacrificing everything even life itself if necessary being entirely submissive to the will of the Father just as He did 5 This is in fact the price to be paid for the salvation of a soul Jesus purposely and metaphorically used the symbol of a cross to help His disciples better understand what sacrifice and devotion to the Lord s cause would truly mean The image of a cross was well known among His disciples and the inhabitants of the Roman Empire because Romans forced victims of crucifixion to publicly carry their own cross or crossbeam to the place where their execution would occur 6It was only after the Savior s Resurrection that the disciples minds were opened to understand all that had been written about Him7 and what would be required of them from that time on 8In the same fashion all of us brothers and sisters need to open our minds and our hearts in order to more fully understand the relevance of taking upon ourselves our crosses and following Him We learn through the scriptures that those who wish to take their cross upon themselves love Jesus Christ in such a way that they deny themselves of all ungodliness and of every worldly lust and keep His commandments 9Our determination to cast off all that is contrary to God s will and to sacrifice all we are asked to give and to strive to follow His teachings will help us to endure in the path of Jesus Christ s gospel even in the face of tribulation the weakness of our souls or the social pressure and worldly philosophies that oppose His teachings For example for those who have not yet found an eternal companion and may be feeling lonely and hopeless or for those who have been divorced and feel abandoned and forgotten I assure you that accepting the Savior s invitation of taking upon yourselves your crosses and following Him means continuing with faith on the Lord s path maintaining a pattern of dignity and not indulging in worldly habits that will eventually take away our hope in God s love and mercy The same principles apply to those of you who are experiencing same gender attraction and feel discouraged and helpless And maybe for this reason some of you are feeling that the gospel of Jesus Christ is not for you anymore If that is the case I want to assure you that there is always hope in God the Father and in His plan of happiness in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice and in living Their loving commandments In His perfect wisdom power justice and mercy the Lord may seal us His that we may be brought to His presence and have everlasting salvation if we are steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments10 and are always abounding in good works 11To those who have committed serious sins accepting this same invitation means among other things to humble yourself before God to counsel with appropriate Church leaders and to repent and forsake your sins This process will also bless all who are fighting against debilitating addictions including opioids drugs alcohol and pornography Taking these steps brings you closer to the Savior who can ultimately free you from guilt sorrow and spiritual and physical slavery Additionally you may also desire to seek the support of your family friends and competent medical and counseling professionals Please never give up after subsequent failures and consider yourself incapable of abandoning sins and overcoming addiction You cannot afford to stop trying and thereafter continue in weakness and sin Always strive to do your best manifesting through your works the desire to cleanse the inner vessel as taught by the Savior 12 Sometimes solutions to certain challenges come after months and months of continuous effort The promise found in the Book of Mormon that it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do 13 is applicable in these circumstances Please remember that the Savior s gift of grace is not necessarily limited in time to after all we can do We may receive His grace before during and after the time when we expend our own efforts 14I testify that as we continually strive to overcome our challenges God will bless us with the gifts of faith to be healed and of the working of miracles 15 He will do for us what we are not capable of doing for ourselves Additionally for those who feel bitter angry offended or chained to sorrows for something you feel is undeserved to take up one s cross and follow the Savior means to strive to lay aside these feelings and turn to the Lord so He can free us from this state of mind and help us to find peace Unfortunately if we hold on to these negative feelings and emotions we may find ourselves living without the influence of the Lord s Spirit in our lives We cannot repent for other people but we can forgive them by refusing to be held hostages by those who have harmed us 16The scriptures teach that there is a way out of these situations by inviting our Savior to help us to replace our stony hearts with new hearts 17 For this to happen we need to come before the Lord with our weaknesses18 and implore His help and forgiveness 19 especially during the sacred moment when we partake of the sacrament each Sunday May we choose to seek His help and take an important and difficult step by forgiving those who have hurt us so that our wounds may begin to heal I promise you that in your doing so your nights will be full of the relief that comes from a mind at peace with the Lord While in Liberty Jail in 1839 the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote an epistle to Church members containing prophecies that are so very applicable in all these circumstances and situations He wrote All thrones and dominions principalities and powers shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ 20 Therefore my dear brothers and sisters those who have taken upon themselves the name of the Savior trusting in His promises and persevering to the end will be saved21 and may dwell with God in a state of never ending happiness 22We all face adverse circumstances in our lives that make us feel sad helpless hopeless and sometimes even weakened Some of these feelings may lead us to question the Lord Why am I experiencing these situations or Why are my expectations not met After all I am doing everything in my power to carry my cross and follow the Savior My dear friends we must remember that taking our cross upon ourselves includes being humble and trusting in God and in His infinite wisdom We must acknowledge that He is aware of each of us and of our needs It is also necessary to accept the fact that the Lord s timing is different than ours Sometimes we seek for a blessing and set a time limit for the Lord to fulfill it We cannot condition our faithfulness to Him by imposing upon Him a deadline for the answers to our desires When we do this we resemble the skeptical Nephites from ancient times who mocked their brothers and sisters by saying that the time was past for the fulfillment of the words spoken by Samuel the Lamanite creating confusion among those who believed 23 We need to trust the Lord enough to be still and know that He is God that He knows all things and that He is aware of each of us 24I recently had the opportunity to minister to a widowed sister named Franca Calamassi who is suffering from a debilitating illness Sister Calamassi was the first member of her family to join the restored Church of Jesus Christ Although her husband was never baptized he consented to meet with the missionaries and often attended Church meetings Despite these circumstances Sister Calamassi remained faithful and raised her four children in the gospel of Jesus Christ A year following her husband s passing Sister Calamassi took her children to the temple and they participated in sacred ordinances and were sealed together as a family The promises associated with these ordinances brought her much hope joy and happiness that helped her carry on in life When the first symptoms of the disease began to appear her bishop gave her a blessing At that time she told her bishop that she was ready to accept the Lord s will expressing her faith to be healed as well as her faith to endure her illness to the end During my visit while holding Sister Calamassi s hand and looking into her eyes I saw an angelic glow emanating from her countenance reflecting her confidence in God s plan and her perfect brightness of hope in the Father s love and plan for her 25 I felt her firm determination to endure in her faith until the end by taking up her cross despite the challenges she was facing This sister s life is a testimony of Christ a statement of her faith and devotion to Him Brothers and sisters I want to testify to you that taking upon us our cross and following the Savior requires us to follow His example and strive to become like Him 26 patiently facing the circumstances of life denying and despising the appetites of the natural man and waiting on the Lord The Psalmist wrote Wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord 27 He is our help and our shield 28I testify to you that following our Master s footsteps and waiting on Him who is the ultimate healer of our lives will provide rest to our souls and make our burdens easy and light 29 Of these things I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters what a great joy it is to be here together again in this general conference for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints under the direction of our beloved prophet President Russell M Nelson I testify to you that we will have the privilege of hearing the voice of our Savior Jesus Christ through the teachings of those who pray sing and speak to the needs of our day in this conference As recorded in the book of Acts Philip the evangelist taught the gospel to a certain Ethiopian who was a eunuch in charge of all the treasures belonging to the queen of Ethiopia 1 While returning from worshipping in Jerusalem he read the book of Isaiah Compelled by the Spirit Philip came closer to him and said Understandest thou what thou readest And the eunuch said How can I except some man should guide me Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus 2The question asked by this Ethiopian man is a reminder of the divine mandate we all have to seek to learn and to teach one another the gospel of Jesus Christ 3 In fact in the context of learning and teaching the gospel we are sometimes like the Ethiopian we need the help of a faithful and inspired teacher and we are sometimes like Philip we need to teach and strengthen others in their conversion Our purpose as we seek to learn and to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ must be to increase faith in God and in His divine plan of happiness and in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice and to achieve lasting conversion Such increased faith and conversion will help us make and keep covenants with God thus strengthening our desire to follow Jesus and producing a genuine spiritual transformation in us in other words transforming us into a new creature as taught by the Apostle Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians 4 This transformation will bring us a more happy productive and healthy life and help us to maintain an eternal perspective Isn t this exactly what happened to the Ethiopian eunuch after he learned about the Savior and was converted to His gospel The scripture says that he went on his way rejoicing 5The commandment to learn the gospel and teach it to one another is not new it has been constantly repeated from the beginning of human history 6 On one particular occasion while Moses and his people were in the plains of Moab before entering the promised land the Lord inspired him to admonish his people concerning their responsibility to learn the statutes and covenants they had received from the Lord and to teach them to their posterity 7 many of whom had not personally experienced the crossing of the Red Sea or the revelation given on Mount Sinai Moses admonished his people Hearken O Israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you Teach them thy sons and thy sons sons 8Then Moses concluded saying Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever 9God s prophets have consistently instructed that we need to raise our families in the nurture and admonition of the Lord 10 and in light and truth 11 President Nelson recently said In this day of rampant immorality and addictive pornography parents have a sacred responsibility to teach their children the importance of God and Jesus Christ in their lives 12Brothers and sisters the warning of our beloved prophet is a further reminder of our individual responsibility to seek to learn and to teach our families that there is a Father in Heaven who loves us and who has developed a divine plan of happiness for His children that Jesus Christ His Son is the Redeemer of the world and that salvation comes from faith in His name 13 Our lives need to be rooted upon the rock of our Redeemer Jesus Christ which might help us individually and as families to have our own spiritual impressions engraved in our hearts helping us to endure in our faith 14You may recall that two disciples of John the Baptist followed Jesus Christ after hearing John witness that Jesus was the Lamb of God the Messiah These good men accepted Jesus s invitation to come and see 15 and abode with Him that day They came to know that Jesus was the Messiah the Son of God and followed Him for the rest of their lives Likewise when we accept the Savior s invitation to come and see we need to abide in Him immersing ourselves in the scriptures rejoicing in them learning His doctrine and striving to live the way He lived Only then will we come to know Him Jesus Christ and recognize His voice knowing that as we come unto Him and believe in Him we shall never hunger nor thirst 16 We will be able to discern the truth at all times as occurred to those two disciples who abode with Jesus that day Brothers and sisters that doesn t happen by chance Attuning ourselves to the highest influences of godliness is not a simple matter it requires calling upon God and learning how to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to the center of our lives If we do so I promise that the influence of the Holy Ghost will bring truth to our heart and mind and will bear witness of it 17 teaching all things 18The Ethiopian s question How can I understand except some man should guide me also has a special meaning in the context of our individual responsibility to put the principles of the gospel we have learned into practice in our lives In the Ethiopian s case for example he acted upon the truth he learned from Philip He asked to be baptized He came to know that Jesus Christ was the Son of God 19Brothers and sisters our actions must reflect what we learn and teach We need to show our beliefs through the way we live The best teacher is a good role model Teaching something that we truly live can make a difference in the hearts of those we teach If we desire people whether that be family or not to joyfully treasure up the scriptures and the teachings of living apostles and prophets of our day they need to see our souls delighting in them Likewise if we want them to know that President Russell M Nelson is the prophet seer and revelator in our day they need to see us raise our hands to sustain him and realize that we follow his inspired teachings As the well known American saying goes Actions speak louder than words Maybe some of you are at this exact moment asking yourselves Elder Soares I have been doing all these things and have been following this model both individually and as a family but unfortunately some of my friends or dear ones have distanced themselves from the Lord What should I do For those of you who are right now experiencing these feelings of sadness agony and maybe regret please know that they are not totally lost because the Lord knows where they are and is watching over them Remember they are His children too It is hard to understand all the reasons why some people take another path The best we can do in these circumstances is just to love and embrace them pray for their well being and seek for the Lord s help to know what to do and say Sincerely rejoice with them in their successes be their friends and look for the good in them We should never give up on them but preserve our relationships Never reject or misjudge them Just love them The parable of the prodigal son teaches us that when children come to themselves they often desire to come home If that happens with your dear ones fill your hearts with compassion run to them fall on their neck and kiss them like the father of the prodigal son did 20Ultimately keep living a worthy life be a good example to them of what you believe and draw closer to our Savior Jesus Christ He knows and understands our deep sorrows and pains and He will bless your efforts and dedication to your dear ones if not in this life in the next life Remember brothers and sisters always that hope is an important part of the gospel plan Throughout many years of service in the Church I have seen faithful members who have consistently applied these principles in their lives This is the case of a single mother whom I will refer to as Mary Sadly Mary went through a tragic divorce At that point in time Mary recognized that her most critical decisions relating to her family would be spiritual Would praying scripture study fasting and church and temple attendance continue to be important to her Mary had always been faithful and at that critical juncture she decided to cling to what she already knew to be true She found strength in The Family A Proclamation to the World which among many wonderful principles teaches that parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness and to teach them to always observe God s commandments 21 She continually searched for answers from the Lord and shared them with her four children in every family setting They frequently discussed the gospel and shared their experiences and testimonies with one another Despite the sorrows they went through her children developed a love for Christ s gospel and a desire to serve and share it with others Three of them faithfully served full time missions and the youngest is now serving in South America Her oldest daughter whom I know pretty well who is now married and strong in her faith shared I never felt like my mom raised us alone because the Lord was always in our home As she bore her witness of Him to us we each began to turn to Him with our own questions I am so grateful she brought the gospel to life Brothers and sisters this good mother was able to make her home a center of spiritual learning Similar to the Ethiopian s question Mary asked herself several times How can my children learn except a mother should guide them My dear companions in the gospel I testify to you that when we earnestly heartily firmly and sincerely seek to learn the gospel of Jesus Christ and teach it to one another with real purpose and under the influence of the Spirit these teachings may transform hearts and inspire a desire to live according to the truths of God I testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world He is the Redeemer and He lives I know He directs His Church through His prophets seers and revelators I also testify to you that God lives that He loves us He wants us back in His presence all of us He listens to our prayers I bear my testimony of these truths in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Good afternoon my dear brothers and sisters As we say in my native Brazilian Portuguese Boa tarde I feel blessed to gather together in this wonderful general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints under the direction of our beloved prophet President Russell M Nelson I marvel at the great opportunity each of us has to listen to the Lord s voice through His servants on earth in these latter days we are living in My home country of Brazil is very rich in natural resources One of them is the famous Amazon River one of the largest and longest rivers in the world It is formed by two separate rivers the Solim es and Negro Interestingly they flow together for a number of miles before the waters blend due to the rivers having very different origins speeds temperatures and chemical compositions After several miles the waters finally blend together becoming a river different than its individual parts Only after these parts merge the Amazon River becomes so powerful that when it reaches the Atlantic Ocean it pushes back the seawater so that fresh water can still be found for many miles out into the ocean In a similar way that the Solim es and Negro Rivers flow together to make the great Amazon River the children of God come together in the restored Church of Jesus Christ from different social backgrounds traditions and cultures forming this wonderful community of Saints in Christ Eventually as we encourage support and love each other we combine to form a mighty force for good in the world As followers of Jesus Christ flowing as one in this river of goodness we will be able to provide the fresh water of the gospel to a thirsty world The Lord has inspired His prophets to teach us how we can support and love each other so we can become united in faith and purpose in following Jesus Christ Paul the New Testament Apostle taught that those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ for ye are all one in Christ Jesus 1When we promise at baptism to follow the Savior we witness before the Father that we are willing to take upon us the name of Christ 2 As we strive to acquire His divine attributes in our lives we become different than we were through the Atonement of Christ the Lord and our love for all people increases naturally 3 We feel a sincere concern for everyone s welfare and happiness We see each other as brothers and sisters as children of God with divine origin attributes and potential We desire to care for each other and bear one another s burdens 4This is what Paul described as charity 5 Mormon a prophet of the Book of Mormon described it as the pure love of Christ 6 which is the most sublime noblest and strongest form of love Our current prophet President Russell M Nelson recently described a manifestation of this pure love of Christ as ministering which is a more focused and holier approach to love and care for other individuals like the Savior did 7Let us consider this principle of love and care as the Savior did within the context of encouraging helping and supporting those who are recent converts and those beginning to show interest in attending our Church services When these new friends come out of the world and embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ joining His Church they become His disciples being born again through Him 8 They leave behind a world they knew well and choose to follow Jesus Christ with full purpose of heart joining a new river like the mighty Amazon River a river that is a valiant force of goodness and righteousness that flows toward the presence of God The Apostle Peter describes it as a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people 9 As these new friends merge into this new and unfamiliar river they may feel a little lost at first These new friends find themselves blending into a river with unique origins temperatures and chemical compositions a river that has its own traditions culture and vocabulary This new life in Christ may seem overwhelming for them Think for a moment about how they may feel as they hear for the first time such expressions as FHE BYC fast Sunday baptism for the dead triple combination and so forth It is easy to see why they may feel like they don t belong In such situations they may ask themselves Is there a place for me here Do I fit into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Does the Church need me Will I find new friends willing to help and support me My dear friends in such moments those of us who are at different points in the long journey of discipleship must extend a warm hand of fellowship to our new friends accept them where they are and help love and include them in our lives All of these new friends are precious sons and daughters of God 10 We cannot afford to lose even one of them because like the Amazon River that depends on tributaries feeding it we need them just as much as they need us to become a mighty force for good in the world Our new friends bring God given talents excitement and goodness within them Their enthusiasm for the gospel can be contagious thereby helping us revitalize our own testimonies They also bring fresh perspectives to our understanding of life and the gospel We have long been taught how we can help our new friends to feel welcome and loved in the restored Church of Jesus Christ They need three things so they may remain strong and faithful throughout their lives First they need brothers and sisters in the Church who are sincerely interested in them true and loyal friends to whom they can constantly turn who will walk beside them and who will answer their questions As members we should always be attentive and look for new faces when attending Church activities and meetings regardless of the responsibilities assignments or concerns we may have We can do simple things to help these new friends feel embraced and welcome in the Church such as giving a warm greeting smiling sincerely at them sitting together to sing and worship introducing them to other members and so forth As we open our hearts to our new friends in some of these ways we are acting in the spirit of ministering When we minister to them like the Savior did they won t feel like strangers within our gates They will feel like they can fit in and make new friends and most importantly they will feel the Savior s love through our genuine care Second new friends need an assignment an opportunity to serve others Service is one of the great geniuses of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints It is a process by which our faith can grow stronger Every new friend deserves that opportunity While the bishop and ward council have direct responsibility to extend assignments soon after their baptism nothing prevents us as members from inviting our new friends to help us serve others informally or through service projects Third new friends must be nourished by the good word of God 11 We can help them to love and become familiar with the scriptures as we read and discuss the teachings with them providing context to the stories and explaining difficult words We can also teach them how to receive personal guidance through regular scripture study In addition we can reach out to our new friends in their own homes and invite them to ours at times outside of our regularly scheduled Church meetings and activities helping them merge into the mighty river of the community of Saints Recognizing the adjustments and challenges our new friends make in becoming members of God s family as our brothers and sisters we can share how we have overcome similar challenges in our lives This will help them know that they are not alone and that God will bless them as they exercise faith in His promises 12When the Solim es and Negro Rivers blend together the Amazon River becomes mighty and strong In a similar fashion when we and our new friends truly merge the restored Church of Jesus Christ becomes even stronger and steadier My sweetheart Rosana and I are so grateful for all those who helped us to blend into this new river many years ago when we embraced the gospel of Jesus Christ in our home country of Brazil Throughout the years these wonderful people have truly ministered to us and have helped us to continue flowing in righteousness We are so grateful for them The prophets in the Western Hemisphere knew well how to keep new friends flowing faithfully together into this new river of goodness toward eternal life For example having seen our day and knowing that we would face similar challenges 13 Moroni included some of those important steps in his writings in the Book of Mormon And after they had been received unto baptism and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ and their names were taken that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God to keep them in the right way to keep them continually watchful unto prayer relying alone upon the merits of Christ who was the author and the finisher of their faith And the church did meet together oft to fast and to pray and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls 14My beloved companions in the work of the Lord I believe we can do much better and should do better in welcoming new friends into the Church I invite you to consider what we can do to be more embracing accepting and helpful to them starting this very next Sunday Be careful not to let your Church assignments get in the way of welcoming new friends at Church meetings and activities After all these souls are precious before the eyes of God and are much more important than programs and activities If we minister to our new friends with our hearts full of pure love as the Savior did I promise you in His name that He will assist us in our efforts When we act as faithful ministers as the Savior did our new friends will have the help they need to remain strong dedicated and faithful to the end They will join us as we become a mighty people of God and will help us to bring fresh water to a world desperately in need of the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ These children of God will feel like they are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints 15 I promise you that they will recognize the presence of our Savior Jesus Christ in His own Church They will continue to flow with us as a river into the fountain of all goodness until they are received with open arms by our Lord Jesus Christ and they hear the Father say Ye shall have eternal life 16I invite you to seek the Lord s help in loving others as He has loved you Let us all follow the counsel given by Mormon Wherefore my beloved brethren and sisters pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ 17 Of these truths I witness and do so in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters wherever you may be I would like to express my sincere and deep thanks for your sustaining vote yesterday Though I feel ineloquent and slow of speech like Moses I console myself in the Lord s words to him Who hath made man s mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord Now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say Exodus 4 11 12 see also verse 10 I take solace also in the love and support of my beloved wife She has been an example of goodness love and total devotion to the Lord and for me and my family I love her with every ounce of my heart and I am grateful for the positive influence she has had on us Brothers and sisters I want to testify to you that President Russell M Nelson is the prophet of God on earth I have never seen anyone more kind and loving than he is Though I felt so inadequate for this sacred call his words and the tender look in his eyes as he extended this responsibility made me feel embraced by the Savior s love Thank you President Nelson I sustain you and I love you Isn t it a blessing to have prophets seers and revelators on earth in these days in which we live who seek to know the will of the Lord and follow it It is comforting to know that we are not alone in the world despite the challenges we face in life Having prophets is a sign of God s love for His children They make known the promises and the true nature of God and of Jesus Christ to Their people I have learned that through my personal experiences Eighteen years ago my wife and I received a phone call from President James E Faust then Second Counselor in the First Presidency He called us to serve as mission president and companion in Portugal He told us that we had only six weeks before we started the mission Although we felt unprepared and inadequate we accepted the call Our most important concern at the time was to obtain the visas required to serve in that country because according to past experience we knew the process took six to eight months to complete President Faust then asked if we had faith that the Lord would perform a miracle and that we would be able to solve the visa problem faster Our answer was a big yes and we started making the arrangements immediately We prepared the documents required for the visas took our three young children and went to the consulate as fast as we could A very nice lady met with us there In reviewing our papers and getting acquainted with what we were going to do in Portugal she turned to us and asked Are you really going to help the people of my country We firmly answered yes and explained that we would represent Jesus Christ and testify of Him and His divine mission in the world We returned there four weeks later received our visas and landed in the mission field within the six weeks as a prophet of the Lord had asked us to do Brothers and sisters from the bottom of my heart I testify that the prophets speak by the power of the Holy Spirit They testify of Christ and His divine mission on earth They represent the mind and heart of the Lord and are called to represent Him and teach us what we must do to return to live in the presence of God and His Son Jesus Christ We are blessed as we exercise our faith and follow their teachings By following them our lives are happier and less complicated our difficulties and problems are easier to bear and we create a spiritual armor around us that will protect us from the attacks of the enemy in our day On this Easter day I solemnly testify that Jesus Christ is risen He lives and He directs His Church on earth through His prophets seers and revelators I testify that He is the Savior and Redeemer of the world and that through Him we can be saved and exalted in the presence of our dear God I love Him I adore Him I want to follow Him and do His will and become more like Him I humbly say these things in the sacred name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters I want to begin my message today by testifying that I know that President Thomas S Monson is the prophet of God in our day His counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles are also in fact prophets seers and revelators They represent the Lord Jesus Christ and have the right to declare His mind and will as it is revealed to them I testify that there is safety in following their counsel The Lord is inspiring them to emphasize strengthening our faith in Heavenly Father and in His Son Jesus Christ and in His Atonement so that we will not waver as we face the challenges of our day In the Book of Mormon we read about a man named Ammon who was sent from the land of Zarahemla to the land of Lehi Nephi to inquire concerning his brethren There he found King Limhi and his people who were in bondage to the Lamanites King Limhi was encouraged by the things Ammon shared with him about his people in Zarahemla His heart was filled with such great hope and joy that he gathered his people to the temple and said Therefore lift up your heads and rejoice and put your trust in God If ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart and serve him with all diligence of mind he will according to his own will and pleasure deliver you out of bondage 1The faith of King Limhi s people was so profoundly affected by the words of Ammon that they made a covenant with God to serve Him and to keep His commandments regardless of their difficult circumstances Because of their faith they were able to devise a plan to escape from the hands of the Lamanites 2Brothers and sisters please consider the importance of the invitation King Limhi gave to his people and its relevance to us He said Lift up your heads and rejoice and put your trust in God With these words Limhi invited his people to look to the future through the eyes of faith to replace their fears with the optimism of hope born of faith and to not waver in placing their trust in God regardless of circumstance Mortal life is a period of testing where we will be proven to see if we will do all things that the Lord our God shall command us 3 This will require unwavering faith in Christ even in times of great difficulty It will require that we press forward with steadfast faith in Christ being led by the Spirit and trusting that God will provide for our needs 4At the conclusion of His earthly ministry just before being taken prisoner the Savior taught His disciples In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 5Ponder with me for a moment Jesus Christ the Only Begotten Son of the Father lived a sinless life and overcame all the temptations pains challenges and afflictions of the world He shed drops of blood in Gethsemane He suffered terrible pain beyond any power of description He took upon Himself all our pains and sicknesses He stands ready to help to help each of us with every burden Through His life suffering death and Resurrection He removed every impediment to our rejoicing and finding peace on this earth The benefits of His atoning sacrifice are extended to all those who accept Him and deny themselves and to those who take up His cross and follow Him as His true disciples 6 Therefore as we exercise faith in Jesus Christ and in His Atonement we will be strengthened our burdens will be eased and through Him we will overcome the world Brothers and sisters as we contemplate the strength and hope that we can receive from the Savior we do have reason to lift up our heads rejoice and press forward in faith without wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed A double minded man is unstable in all his ways 7King Limhi likewise urged Turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart serve him with all diligence of mind if ye do this he will according to his own will and pleasure deliver you out of bondage 8Listen to the Savior s own words as He entreats us Let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me If ye love me keep my commandments He that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him 9God blesses us according to our faith 10 Faith is the source of living with divine purpose and eternal perspective Faith is a practical principle that inspires diligence It is a vital living force manifest in our positive attitude and desire to willingly do everything that God and Jesus Christ ask of us It takes us to our knees to implore the Lord for guidance and to arise and act with confidence to achieve things consistent with His will Years ago while serving as a mission president I received a phone call from the parents of one of our beloved missionaries informing me about the death of his sister I remember in the tenderness of that moment that missionary and I discussed God s marvelous plan of salvation for His children and how this knowledge would comfort him Although he was stunned and saddened by that adversity this missionary through his tears and with faith in God rejoiced in his sister s life He expressed unwavering confidence in the tender mercies of the Lord Resolutely he told me that he would continue to serve his mission with all faith and diligence in order to be worthy of the promises that God had for him and his family In this time of need that faithful missionary turned his heart to God placed all of his trust in Him and renewed his commitment to serve the Lord with faith and with all diligence Brothers and sisters if we are not rooted by steadfast trust in God and the desire to serve Him the painful experiences of mortality can lead us to feel as though we are burdened by a heavy yoke and we can lose the motivation to live the gospel fully Without faith we will end up losing the capacity to appreciate those designs of our God regarding the things that will happen later in our life 11In these moments of trial the adversary who is always on the lookout tries to use our logic and reasoning against us He tries to convince us that it is useless to live the principles of the gospel Please remember that the logic of the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him 12 Remember that Satan is an enemy of God and he fighteth against him continually and inviteth and enticeth us to sin and to do that which is evil continually 13 We must not allow him to deceive us for when we do we falter in our faith and lose the power to obtain God s blessings If we are steadfast and do not waver in our faith the Lord will increase our capacity to raise ourselves above the challenges of life We will be enabled to subdue negative impulses and we will develop the capacity to overcome even what appear to be overwhelming obstacles This was what enabled King Limhi s people to make a spectacular escape from their Lamanite captivity Brothers and sisters I invite you to place all of your trust in God and in the teachings of His prophets I invite you to renew your covenants with God to serve Him with all your heart regardless of the complex situations of life I testify that by the power of your unwavering faith in Christ you will become free of the captivity of sin of doubt of unbelief of unhappiness of suffering and you will receive all of the promised blessings from our loving Heavenly Father I testify that God is real He lives He loves us He listens to our prayers in our moments of happiness and in our moments of doubt sadness and desperation I testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world He is the Redeemer I close my remarks today with the lyrics of the hymn Not Now but in the Coming Years found in the Portuguese hymnal If clouds instead of sun spread shadows o er our heart If pain afflicts us never mind we will soon know who Thou art Jesus guides us with His hand and He will tell us why If we listen to His voice He will tell us by and by Confide in God unwaveringly and let Him us sustain Sing His glory endlessly for later He ll explain 14I say these things in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brethren I am humbled by the privilege I have to speak to you the bearers of the priesthood of God throughout the Church today President Thomas S Monson once said The world can at times be a frightening place in which to live The moral fabric of society seems to be unraveling at an alarming speed None whether young or old or in between is exempt from exposure to those things which have the potential to drag us down and destroy us But we need not despair We are waging a war with sin It is a war we can and will win Our Father in Heaven has given us the tools we need in order to do so 1All of us young and old are faced daily with the war mentioned by President Monson The enemy and his angels are trying to distract us Their purpose is to encourage us to deviate from the covenants that we have made with the Lord causing us to lose sight of our eternal inheritance They know well our Heavenly Father s plan for His children for they were present with us in that great Council in Heaven when it was all presented They try to take advantage of our weaknesses and frailties deceiving us with mists of darkness which blindeth the eyes and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men and leadeth them away into broad roads that they perish and are lost 2Despite the opposition we face as President Monson has taught this is a war that we can and will win The Lord trusts in our capacity and determination to do so The scriptures contain countless examples of those who have won their wars even in the midst of very hostile situations One of these examples is Captain Moroni in the Book of Mormon This remarkable young man had the courage to defend the truth at a time when there were many dissensions and wars which put at risk the very survival of the entire Nephite nation Although he was brilliant in exercising his responsibilities Moroni remained humble This and other attributes made him an extraordinary instrument in the hands of God at that time The book of Alma explains that if all men had been like Moroni the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever and the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men 3 All of Moroni s attributes stemmed from his great faith in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ4 and his firm determination to follow the voice of God and His prophets 5Figuratively all of us need to transform ourselves into modern Captain Moronis in order to win the wars against evil I know a very faithful young deacon who transformed himself into a modern Captain Moroni Inasmuch as he has sought to follow the counsel of his parents and Church leaders his faith and determination have been tested every day even at his young age He told me one day he was surprised by a very difficult and uncomfortable situation his friends were accessing pornographic images on their cell phones In that exact moment this young man had to decide what was most important his popularity or his righteousness In the few seconds that followed he was filled with courage and told his friends that what they were doing was not right Moreover he told them that they should stop what they were doing or they would become slaves to it Most of his classmates ridiculed his counsel saying that it was a part of life and that there was nothing wrong with it However there was one among them who listened to the counsel of that young man and decided to stop what he was doing This deacon s example had a positive influence on at least one of his classmates Undoubtedly he and his friend faced mockery and persecution because of that decision On the other hand they had followed the admonition of Alma to his people when he said Come ye out from the wicked and be ye separate and touch not their unclean things 6The pamphlet For the Strength of Youth contains the following counsel approved by the First Presidency for the youth of the Church You are responsible for the choices you make God is mindful of you and will help you make good choices even if your family and friends use their agency in ways that are not right Have the moral courage to stand firm in obeying God s will even if you have to stand alone As you do this you set an example for others to follow 7The war of good against evil will continue throughout our lives since the adversary s purpose is to make all people as miserable as he is Satan and his angels will try to shroud our thoughts and assert control by tempting us to sin If they can they will corrupt all that is good Nevertheless it is essential to understand that they will have power over us only if we allow it The scriptures also contain several examples of those who gave that permission to the adversary and ended up becoming confused and even destroyed like Nehor Korihor and Sherem We need to be alert to this danger We cannot allow ourselves to be confused by popular messages that are easily accepted by the world and that contradict the doctrine and true principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ Many of these worldly messages represent nothing more than an attempt of our society to justify sin We need to remember that at the end all will stand before Christ to be judged of our works whether they are good or whether they are evil 8 As we encounter these worldly messages great courage and a solid knowledge of the plan of our Heavenly Father will be required to choose the right All of us can receive the strength to choose the right if we seek the Lord and place all our trust and faith in Him But as the scriptures teach we need to have a sincere heart and real intent Then the Lord in His infinite mercy will manifest the truth unto us by the power of the Holy Ghost And by the power of the Holy Ghost we may know the truth of all things 9This knowledge acquired through the Holy Ghost is nothing more than our testimony which propels our faith and determination to follow the teachings of the restored gospel in these latter days regardless of the popular messages we hear from the world Our testimony must be our shield to protect us against the fiery darts of the adversary in his attempts to attack us 10 It will guide us safely through the darkness and confusion that exist in the world today 11I learned this principle when I served as a young missionary My companion and I were serving in a very small and faraway branch of the Church We tried to speak with every person in the city They received us very well but they liked to debate the scriptures and asked us for concrete evidence regarding the truthfulness of what we were teaching I recall that each time my companion and I set out to try to prove something to people the Spirit of God left us and we felt totally lost and confused We felt that we should more strongly align our testimonies with the truths of the gospel we were teaching From that time on I remember that when we bore a testimony with all our hearts a silent confirming power coming from the Holy Ghost filled the room and there was no space for confusion or discussion I learned that no evil forces exist that are capable of confusing deceiving or subverting the power of a sincere testimony of a true disciple of Jesus Christ As the Savior Himself taught the adversary desires to sift us as wheat causing us to lose our ability to influence the world for good 12My dear brethren because of the wave of confusion and doubt spreading throughout the world today we must hold ever more tightly to our testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ Then will our ability to defend truth and justice greatly increase We will win the daily battles against evil and rather than fall on the battlefields of life we will rally others to the Master s standards I invite all to find safety in the teachings contained in the scriptures Captain Moroni aligned his faith in God and his testimony of the truth with the knowledge and wisdom found in the scriptures In this way he trusted that he would receive the blessings of the Lord and would obtain many victories which is what in fact happened I invite all to find safety in the wise words of our current prophets President Thomas S Monson said We who have been ordained to the priesthood of God can make a difference When we maintain our personal purity and honor our priesthood we become righteous examples for others to follow and we help to illuminate an increasingly dark world 13I invite all to trust in the merits and in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ Through His atoning sacrifice we can gain the courage to win all the wars of our time even in the midst of our difficulties challenges and temptations Let us trust in His love and power to save us Christ Himself said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me 14 I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life 15 These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 16I bear testimony of these truths in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Mormon taught that a man cannot have faith and hope save he shall be meek and lowly of heart 1 He added that without such attributes faith and hope is vain for none is acceptable before God save the meek and lowly in heart 2Meekness is the quality of those who are Godfearing righteous humble teachable and patient under suffering 3 Those who possess this attribute are willing to follow Jesus Christ and their temperament is calm docile tolerant and submissive The Apostle Paul taught that meekness is a fruit of the Spirit 4 Therefore it can most easily be attained if we live in the Spirit 5 And to live in the Spirit our lifestyle must reflect righteousness before the Lord As we take Christ s name upon us it is expected that we strive to emulate His attributes and change our character to become more like Him each day The Savior admonishing His disciples said Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect 6 If we come unto Christ deny ourselves of all ungodliness and love God then through Christ s grace the day will come when we may be perfect in Him 7 Christlike attributes are gifts from God These attributes come as we use our agency righteously With a desire to please God we have to recognize our weaknesses and be willing and anxious to improve 8Meekness is vital for us to become more Christlike Without it we won t be able to develop other important virtues Being meek does not mean weakness but it does mean behaving with goodness and kindness showing strength serenity healthy self worth and self control Meekness was one of the most abundant attributes in the Savior s life He Himself taught His disciples Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart 9We are blessed to be born with the seed of meekness in our hearts We need to understand that it is not possible to grow and develop that seed in the twinkling of an eye but rather through the process of time Christ asks us to take up our cross daily 10 meaning that it must be a constant focus and desire President Lorenzo Snow the fifth prophet of our dispensation taught It is our duty to try to be perfect to improve each day and look upon our course last week and do things better this week do things better today than we did them yesterday 11 So the first step to becoming meek is to improve day by day Each day we need to try to be better than the previous as we move forward through this process President Snow added We have our little follies and our weaknesses we should try to overcome them as fast as possible and should instill this feeling in the hearts of our children that they may learn to behave properly before Him under all circumstances If the husband can live with his wife one day without quarrelling or without treating anyone unkindly or without grieving the Spirit of God he is so far perfect Then let him try to be the same the next day But supposing he should fail in this his next day s attempt that is no reason why he should not succeed in doing so the third day 12Upon acknowledging our dedication and perseverance the Lord will give us that which we are not able to attain due to our imperfections and human weaknesses Another important step to becoming meek is learning how to control our temper Because the natural man dwells within each one of us and because we live in a world full of pressure controlling our temper may become one of the challenges in our lives Think for a few seconds how you react when someone does not comply with your desires the moment you want them to What about when people disagree with your ideas even though you are absolutely sure that they represent the proper solution to a problem What is your response when someone offends you critiques your efforts or is simply unkind because he or she is in a bad mood At these moments and in other difficult situations we must learn to control our temper and convey our feelings with patience and gentle persuasion This is most important within our homes and within our relationships with our eternal companions During the 31 years I ve been married to my sweetheart she has often given me gentle reminders of this as we have faced life s unsettling challenges Among instructions found in his Second Epistle to Timothy the Apostle Paul said And the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth And that they may recover themselves 13By controlling our reactions being calm and temperate and avoiding contention we will begin to qualify for the gift of meekness President Henry B Eyring once said When we with faith control our tempers and subdue our pride the Holy Ghost gives His approval and sacred promises and covenants become sure 14Another step to attain meekness is to become humble The Lord instructed Thomas B Marsh through the Prophet Joseph Smith saying Be thou humble and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers 15I believe brothers and sisters that only those who are humble are able to acknowledge and understand the Lord s answers to their prayers The humble are teachable recognizing how dependent they are on God and desiring to be subject to His will The humble are meek and have the ability to influence others to be the same God s promise to the humble is that He will lead them by the hand I truly believe that we will avoid detours and sadness in our lives as long as we walk hand in hand with the Lord One of the most beautiful modern day examples of meekness that I am aware of is that of Brother Moses Mahlangu His conversion began in 1964 when he received a copy of the Book of Mormon He was fascinated as he read this book but it was not until the early 70s that he saw an LDS Church sign on a building in Johannesburg South Africa as he was walking down a street Brother Mahlangu was intrigued and entered the building to learn more about the Church He was kindly told that he could not attend the services or be baptized because the country s laws did not allow it at that time Brother Mahlangu accepted that decision with meekness humility and without resentment but he continued to have a strong desire to learn more about the Church He asked the Church leaders if they could leave one of the meetinghouse windows open during the Sunday meetings so he could sit outside and listen to the services For several years Brother Mahlangu s family and friends attended church regularly through the window One day in 1980 they were told that they could attend church and also be baptized What a glorious day it was for Brother Mahlangu Later the Church organized a branch in his neighborhood in Soweto This was possible only because of the determination courage and faithfulness of people like Brother Mahlangu who remained faithful for so many years under difficult circumstances One of Brother Mahlangu s friends who had joined the Church at the same time recounted this story to me when I visited the Soweto stake At the end of our conversation he gave me a hug At that moment brothers and sisters I felt as if I was encircled in the Savior s loving arms Meekness emanated from this good brother s eyes With a heart full of goodness and deep gratitude he asked if I could just tell President Thomas S Monson how grateful and blessed he and many others were for having the true gospel in their lives Brother Mahlangu and his friend s example of meekness truly influenced many lives for good especially mine Brothers and sisters I believe the Savior Jesus Christ is the supreme example of meekness Even during the last moments of His mortal life being unfairly accused and condemned painfully carrying His cross up to Golgotha being mocked and cursed by His enemies being abandoned by many who knew Him and had witnessed His miracles He was nailed on the cross Even after the most intense physical suffering the Lord turned to His Father and spoke from the bottom of His meek and humble heart Father forgive them for they know not what they do 16 Christ faced extreme physical and spiritual suffering giving us the opportunity to change our spiritual character and become meek like Him I bear my witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior I testify to you that thanks to His love it is possible to change It is possible to leave our weaknesses behind It is possible to reject the evil influences in our lives control our anger become meek and develop the attributes of our Savior He showed us the way He gave us the perfect example and commanded each one of us to become as He is His invitation to us is to follow Him follow His example and become like Him Of these truths I bear testimony in His sacred name even Jesus Christ amen 
President Thomas S Monson once said May I provide a simple formula by which you can measure the choices which confront you It s easy to remember You can t be right by doing wrong you can t be wrong by doing right Pathways to Perfection Liahona July 2002 112 Ensign May 2002 100 President Monson s formula is simple and direct It works the same way as the Liahona given to Lehi did If we exercise faith and are diligent in obeying the Lord s commandments we will easily find the correct direction to follow especially when we face our day to day choices The Apostle Paul exhorts us about the importance of sowing in the Spirit and being aware of not sowing in the flesh He said Be not deceived God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not Galatians 6 7 9 To sow in the Spirit means that all our thoughts words and actions must elevate us to the level of the divinity of our heavenly parents However the scriptures refer to the flesh as the physical or carnal nature of the natural man which allows people to be influenced by passion desires appetites and drives of the flesh instead of looking for inspiration from the Holy Ghost If we are not careful those influences together with the pressure of the evil in the world may conduct us to adopt vulgar and reckless behavior which may become part of our character In order to avoid those bad influences we have to follow what the Lord instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith about continuously sowing in the Spirit Wherefore be not weary in well doing for ye are laying the foundation of a great work And out of small things proceedeth that which is great D C 64 33 To enhance our spirit it is required that we let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from us with all malice Ephesians 4 31 and that we be wise in the days of our probation and strip ourselves of all uncleanness Mormon 9 28 As we study the scriptures we learn that the promises made by the Lord to us are conditional upon our obedience and encourage righteous living Those promises must nourish our soul bringing us hope by encouraging us not to give up even in the face of our daily challenges of living in a world whose ethical and moral values are becoming extinct thus motivating people to sow in the flesh even more But how can we be certain that our choices are helping us to sow in the Spirit and not in the flesh President George Albert Smith repeating counsel from his grandfather once said There is a line of demarcation well defined between the Lord s territory and the devil s territory If you will stay on the Lord s side of the line you will be under his influence and will have no desire to do wrong but if you cross to the devil s side of that line one inch you are in the tempter s power and if he is successful you will not be able to think or even reason properly because you will have lost the Spirit of the Lord Teachings of Presidents of the Church George Albert Smith 2011 191 Therefore our daily question must be Do my actions place me in the Lord s or in the enemy s territory Mormon the prophet alerted his people about the importance of having the ability to distinguish good from evil Wherefore all things which are good cometh of God and that which is evil cometh of the devil for the devil is an enemy unto God and fighteth against him continually and inviteth and enticeth to sin and to do that which is evil continually But behold that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually Moroni 7 12 13 The Light of Christ together with the companionship of the Holy Ghost must help us determine if our manner of living is placing us in the Lord s territory or not If our attitudes are good they are inspired of God for every good thing comes from God However if our attitudes are bad we are being influenced by the enemy because he persuades men to do evil The African people have touched my heart because of their determination and diligence to stay in the Lord s territory Even in adverse circumstances in life those who accept the invitation to come unto Christ become a light to the world A few weeks ago while visiting one of the wards in South Africa I had the privilege to accompany two young priests their bishop and their stake president in a visit to less active young men of their quorum I was greatly impressed by the courage and humility that those two priests showed as they invited the less active young men to return to church While they talked to those less active young men I noticed that their countenances reflected the Savior s light and at the same time filled with light all those around them They were fulfilling their duty to succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees D C 81 5 The attitude of those two priests placed them in the Lord s territory and they served as instruments in His hands as they invited others to do the same In Doctrine and Covenants 20 37 the Lord teaches us what it means to sow in the Spirit and what really places us in the Lord s territory as follows humble ourselves before God come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits witness before the Church that we have truly repented of all our sins take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ have a determination to serve Him to the end manifest by our works that we have received the Spirit of Christ and be received by baptism into His Church Our disposition to fulfill these covenants prepares us to live in God s presence as exalted beings The remembrance of these covenants must guide our behavior in relation to our family in our social interaction with other people and especially in our relationship with the Savior Jesus Christ established the perfect behavior pattern by which we can build upon our attitudes to be able to fulfill these sacred covenants The Savior banished from His life any influence that might take His focus away from His divine mission especially when He was tempted by the enemy or by his followers while He ministered here on earth Although He never sinned He had a broken heart and a contrite spirit full of love for our Heavenly Father and for all men He humbled Himself before our Father in Heaven denying His own will to fulfill what the Father had asked of Him in all things until the end Even at that moment of extreme physical and spiritual pain carrying the burden of the sins of all mankind on His shoulders and shedding blood through His pores He told the Father Nevertheless not what I will but what thou wilt Mark 14 36 My prayer brothers and sisters as we think about our covenants is that we may keep ourselves strong against the fiery darts of the adversary 1 Nephi 15 24 following the Savior s example so that we may sow in the Spirit and abide in the Lord s territory Let us remember President Monson s formula You can t be right by doing wrong you can t be wrong by doing right I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On one occasion the Savior asked a question to Peter three times Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me He saith unto him Yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee Jesus saith unto him Feed my sheep 1Because He was deeply concerned with the welfare of our Heavenly Father s children the Lord gave Peter the special charge of feeding the sheep He reaffirmed this same concern in modern times through a revelation given to Joseph Smith Now I say unto you and what I say unto you I say unto all the Twelve Arise and gird up your loins take up your cross follow me and feed my sheep 2As we study the scriptures we notice that the Savior ministered to people according to their specific needs A good example of this occurred when He was near Capernaum and Jairus a ruler of the synagogue fell down at Jesus s feet and pleaded with the Lord to come into his house and bless his daughter who was dying Jesus went with Jairus even though the crowd made it difficult for Him to move fast And then a messenger came telling Jairus his daughter was already dead Even grieving as he was Jairus kept his steadfast faith in the Lord who comforted the heart of that father saying Fear not believe only and she shall be made whole And when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the maiden And all wept and bewailed her but he said Weep not she is not dead but sleepeth And took her by the hand and called saying Maid arise And her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat 3Jesus showed patience and love to all who came to Him seeking relief for their physical emotional or spiritual illnesses and who felt discouraged and downtrodden To follow the Savior s example each one of us must look around and reach out to the sheep who are facing the same circumstances and lift them up and encourage them to proceed on the journey towards eternal life This need today is as great as or perhaps even greater than when the Savior walked on this earth As shepherds we must understand that we should nurture each one of our sheep to bring them to Christ which is the purpose of all we do in this Church Any activity meeting or program should focus on this same objective As we stay in tune with the needs of the people we can strengthen them and help them overcome their challenges so they will remain steadfast in the way which will lead them back to our Heavenly Father s presence and help them endure to the end The gospel of Jesus Christ is about people not programs Sometimes in the haste of fulfilling our Church responsibilities we spend too much time concentrating on programs instead of focusing on people and end up taking their real needs for granted When things like that happen we lose the perspective of our callings neglect people and prevent them from reaching their divine potential to gain eternal life As I was about to have my 12th birthday my bishop invited me for an interview and taught me how to prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and be ordained a deacon As the interview was coming to an end he pulled out a set of forms from his desk and challenged me to fill them out They were mission call papers I was astonished After all I was only 11 But that bishop had a vision of the future and of the blessings that would be mine if I prepared properly to serve a mission when my time came He showed he really cared about me He told me the steps I should take to prepare both financially and spiritually to serve the Lord After that day he and then the bishop who was called after him interviewed me at least twice a year until I was 19 and encouraged me to remain faithful in my preparation They kept my missionary forms in the files and mentioned them whenever we had an interview With my parents help and with the encouragement of loving and patient bishops I served a mission The mission helped me gain a perspective of the blessings God has in store for all who endure to the end It does not matter whether it is a child youth or adult everyone needs to feel loved We have been counseled for several years to focus on working with new converts and less active members People will remain in the Church when they feel someone cares for them Among the last instructions the Savior gave His Apostles He said A new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another 4People are most receptive to our influence when they feel that we truly love them and not only because we have a calling to fulfill As we express true love for people they will be able to feel the influence of the Spirit and may feel motivated to follow our teachings It is not always easy to love people for what they are The prophet Mormon explained what we should do if such challenges arise Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure 5Christ Himself ministered to people lifting the heavy laden giving hope to the disheartened and seeking after the ones who were lost He showed people how much He loved and understood them and how precious they were He acknowledged their divine nature and eternal value Even when calling people to repentance He condemned the sin without condemning the sinner In his first epistle to the Corinthians the Apostle Paul emphasized the need of expressing this true love to each sheep of the Lord s flock And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing Charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up Doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil Rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth Beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things And now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity 6As we follow the Savior s example and teachings we can assist people to fulfill their earthly mission and return to live with our Heavenly Father Of this I bear you my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ amen
