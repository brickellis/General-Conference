My beloved brothers and sisters I am grateful to be with you in this general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints In his invitation to reflect on the way the Lord s Restoration of His Church in this last dispensation has blessed us and our loved ones President Russell M Nelson promised that our experience would be not only memorable but unforgettable My experience has been memorable as I am sure yours has been Whether it will be unforgettable depends on each one of us That matters to me because the experience of preparing for this conference has changed me in a way that I want to last Let me explain My preparation took me to the record of an event in the Restoration I had read about that event many times but it had always been to me a report of an important meeting that involved Joseph Smith the prophet of the Restoration But this time I saw in the account how the Lord leads us His disciples in His Church I saw what it means for us mortals to be led by the Savior of the world the Creator who knows all things past present and future He teaches us step by step and guides us never forcing The meeting I m describing was a pivotal moment in the Restoration It was a Sabbath day meeting held on April 3 1836 in the Kirtland Temple in Ohio seven days after it was dedicated Joseph Smith described this great moment in the history of the world in a simple way Much of his account is recorded in Doctrine and Covenants section 110 In the afternoon I assisted the other Presidents in distributing the Lord s Supper to the Church receiving it from the Twelve whose privilege it was to officiate at the sacred desk this day After having performed this service to my brethren I retired to the pulpit the veils being dropped and bowed myself with Oliver Cowdery in solemn and silent prayer After rising from prayer the following vision was opened to both of us 1 The veil was taken from our minds and the eyes of our understanding were opened We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit before us and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold in color like amber His eyes were as a flame of fire the hair of his head was white like the pure snow his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters even the voice of Jehovah saying I am the first and the last I am he who liveth I am he who was slain I am your advocate with the Father Behold your sins are forgiven you you are clean before me therefore lift up your heads and rejoice Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice and let the hearts of all my people rejoice who have with their might built this house to my name For behold I have accepted this house and my name shall be here and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house Yea I will appear unto my servants and speak unto them with mine own voice if my people will keep my commandments and do not pollute this holy house Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my people Even so Amen After this vision closed the heavens were again opened unto us and Moses appeared before us and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north After this Elias appeared and committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham saying that in us and our seed all generations after us should be blessed After this vision had closed another great and glorious vision burst upon us for Elijah the prophet who was taken to heaven without tasting death stood before us and said Behold the time has fully come which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi testifying that he Elijah should be sent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near even at the doors 2Now I had read that account many times The Holy Ghost had confirmed to me that the account was true But as I studied and prepared for this conference I came to see more clearly the power of the Lord to lead in detail His disciples in His work Seven years before Moses committed to Joseph the keys of the gathering of Israel in the Kirtland Temple Joseph learned from the title page of the Book of Mormon that its purpose was to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel that they may know the covenants of the Lord that they are not cast off forever In 1831 the Lord told Joseph that the gathering of Israel would commence in Kirtland And from thence Kirtland whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations for Israel shall be saved and I will lead them 3Although missionary work was needed to gather Israel the Lord inspired His leaders to teach the Twelve who became some of our early missionaries Remember you are not to go to other nations till you receive your endowment 4It seems that the Kirtland Temple was important to the Lord s step by step plan for at least two reasons First Moses waited until the temple was completed to restore the keys of the gathering of Israel And second President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that the Lord commanded the Saints to build a temple the Kirtland Temple in which he could reveal the keys of authority and where the apostles could be endowed and prepared to prune his vineyard for the last time 5 Although the temple endowment as we know it today wasn t administered in the Kirtland Temple in fulfillment of prophecy preparatory temple ordinances began to be introduced there along with an outpouring of spiritual manifestations which armed those called on missions with the promised endowment of power from on high 6 that led to a great gathering through missionary service After the keys of the gathering of Israel were committed to Joseph the Lord inspired the Prophet to send out members of the Twelve on missions As I studied it became clear to me that the Lord had prepared in detail the way for the Twelve to go on missions abroad where people had been prepared to believe and sustain them In time thousands would through them be brought into the Lord s restored Church According to our records it is estimated that between 7 500 and 8 000 were baptized during the two missions of the Twelve to the British Isles This laid the foundation for missionary work in Europe By the end of the 19th century some 90 000 had gathered to America with the most of these coming from the British Isles and Scandinavia 7 The Lord had inspired Joseph and those faithful missionaries who went to work to achieve a harvest that must have at the time seemed beyond them But the Lord with His perfect foresight and preparation made it possible You remember the apparently simple and almost poetic language from section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants Behold the time has fully come which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi testifying that he Elijah should be sent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near even at the doors 8I testify that the Lord saw far into the future and how He would lead us to help Him accomplish His purposes in the last days While I was serving in the Presiding Bishopric many years ago I was charged with overseeing the design and development group that created what we named FamilySearch I am careful to say that I oversaw its creation rather than saying I directed it Many brilliant people left careers and came to build what the Lord wanted The First Presidency had set a goal of reducing the duplication of ordinances Their major concern was our being unable to know whether a person s ordinances had already been performed For years or what seemed like years the First Presidency asked me When will you have it done With prayer diligence and the personal sacrifice of people of great ability the task was accomplished It came step by step The first task was to make FamilySearch user friendly for those who were not comfortable with computers More changes came and I know they will continue to come for whenever we proceed to resolve one inspired problem we open the door for further revelation for advancements at least equally important but not yet seen Even today FamilySearch is becoming what the Lord needs for part of His Restoration and not just for avoiding duplication of ordinances The Lord let us make improvements to help people gain feelings of familiarity and even love for their ancestors and complete their temple ordinances Now as the Lord surely knew would happen young people are becoming computer mentors to their parents and ward members All have found great joy in this service The spirit of Elijah is changing the hearts of young and old children and parents grandchildren and grandparents Temples will soon again be happily scheduling baptismal opportunities and other sacred ordinances The desire to serve our ancestors and the bonding of parents and children are growing The Lord saw it all coming He planned for it step by step as He has done with other changes in His Church He has raised up and prepared faithful people who choose to do hard things well He has always been lovingly patient in helping us learn line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little 9 He is firm in the timing and the sequence of His intentions yet He ensures that sacrifice often brings continuing blessings that we did not foresee I close by expressing my gratitude to the Lord He who inspired President Nelson to invite me to make a sacrifice to prepare for this conference Every hour and every prayer during my preparation brought a blessing I invite all who hear this message or read these words to have faith that the Lord is leading the Restoration of His gospel and His Church He goes before us He knows the future perfectly He invites you to the work He joins you in it He has in place a plan for your service And even as you sacrifice you will feel joy as you help others rise to be ready for His coming I testify to you that God the Father lives Jesus is the Christ This is His Church He knows and loves you He guides you He has prepared the way for you In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
The prayer of Elder Maynes at the beginning of this first session of general conference is being answered Inspiration has come to us through wonderful messages and beautiful music The promise of President Russell M Nelson that this conference will be memorable is already beginning to be fulfilled President Nelson has designated this year as a bicentennial period commemorating 200 years since God the Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith in a vision President Nelson invited us to make a personal plan to prepare ourselves for this historic conference which commemoration he said would be a hinge point in the history of the Church and your part is vital 1Like me perhaps you heard his message and asked yourself In what way is my part vital Perhaps you read and prayed about the events of the Restoration Perhaps more than ever before you read the accounts of those few times when God the Father introduced His Beloved Son Perhaps you read of the instances when the Savior spoke to the children of our Heavenly Father I know I did all of those things and more I found references in my reading to the priesthood of God and the opening of dispensations I was humbled as I realized that my preparation for this conference was a hinge point in my personal history I felt changes in my heart I felt new gratitude I felt filled with joy at the prospect of being invited to participate in this celebration of the ongoing Restoration I imagine that others are feeling because of careful preparation more joyful more optimistic and more determined to serve in any capacity needed by the Lord The transcendent events we honor were the beginning of the prophesied last dispensation in which the Lord is preparing His Church and His people those who bear His name to receive Him As part of our preparation for His coming He will lift each of us so we may rise to spiritual challenges and opportunities unlike any seen in the history of this world In September 1840 the Prophet Joseph Smith and his counselors in the First Presidency declared the following The work of the Lord in these last days is one of vast magnitude and almost beyond the comprehension of mortals Its glories are past description and its grandeur unsurpassable It is the theme which has animated the bosom of prophets and righteous men from the creation of the world down through every succeeding generation to the present time and it is truly the dispensation of the fullness of times when all things which are in Christ Jesus whether in heaven or on the earth shall be gathered together in Him and when all things shall be restored as spoken of by all the holy prophets since the world began for in it will take place the glorious fulfilment of the promises made to the fathers while the manifestations of the power of the Most High will be great glorious and sublime They went on to say We feel disposed to go forward and unite our energies for the upbuilding of the Kingdom and establishing the Priesthood in their fullness and glory The work which has to be accomplished in the last days is one of vast importance and will call into action the energy skill talent and ability of the Saints so that it may roll forth with that glory and majesty described by the prophet Daniel see Daniel 2 34 35 44 45 and will consequently require the concentration of the Saints to accomplish works of such magnitude and grandeur 2Many of the specifics of what we will do and when we will do it in the unfolding Restoration are not yet revealed Yet the First Presidency even in those early days knew some of the breadth and depth of the work the Lord has set before us Here are a few examples of what we do know will take place Through His Saints the Lord will offer the gift of His gospel to every nation kindred tongue and people 3 Technology and miracles will continue to play a part as will individual fishers of men 4 who minister with power and increasing faith We as a people will become more united amid increasing conflict We will be gathered in the spiritual strength of groups and families filled with gospel light Even an unbelieving world will recognize The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and realize the power of God upon it Faithful and brave disciples will fearlessly humbly and openly take upon them the name of Christ in their everyday lives How then can each of us participate in this work of such magnitude and grandeur President Nelson has taught us how to grow in spiritual power When we take repentance as a joyful opportunity because of our growing faith that Jesus is the Christ when we understand and believe that Heavenly Father hears our every prayer when we strive to obey and live the commandments we grow in our power to receive continuing revelation The Holy Ghost can be our constant companion A feeling of light will stay with us even as the world around us becomes darker Joseph Smith is an example of how to grow in such spiritual power He showed us that the prayer of faith is the key to revelation from God He prayed in faith believing that God the Father would answer his prayer He prayed in faith believing that only through Jesus Christ could he be freed from the guilt he felt for his sins And he prayed in faith believing that he needed to find the true Church of Jesus Christ to gain that forgiveness Throughout his prophetic ministry Joseph Smith used prayers of faith to obtain continuous revelation As we face today s challenges and those yet to come we too will need to practice the same pattern President Brigham Young said I do not know any other way for the Latter day Saints than for every breath to be virtually a prayer for God to guide and direct his people 5These words from the sacrament prayer should then describe our daily life Always remember him Him refers to Jesus Christ The next words and keep his commandments suggest what it means for us to remember Him 6 As we remember Jesus Christ always we might ask in silent prayer What would He have me do Such prayer offered in faith in Jesus Christ ushered in this last dispensation And it will be at the heart of the part each of us will play in its continuing unfolding I have found as you have wonderful examples of such prayer First is Joseph Smith He asked in childlike faith what the Lord would have him do His answer changed the history of the world To me an important lesson comes from Joseph s response to Satan s assault as Joseph knelt to pray I know from experience that Satan and his servants try to make us feel that we must not pray When Joseph Smith exerted all his powers to call upon God to deliver him from the power that tried to bind him his prayer for relief was answered and Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared Satan s attempt to thwart the beginning of the Restoration was so severe because Joseph s prayer was so important You and I will have smaller parts to play in the ongoing Restoration Yet the enemy of the Restoration will try to stop us from praying The example of Joseph s faith and his determination can strengthen us in our resolve This is one of many reasons why my prayers include thanks to Heavenly Father for the Prophet Joseph Enos in the Book of Mormon is another model for my prayer of faith as I try to play my part in the continuing Restoration Whatever your part will be you could take him as a personal mentor Like Joseph Enos prayed in faith He described his experience this way And my soul hungered and I kneeled down before my Maker and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul and all the day long did I cry unto him yea and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens And there came a voice unto me saying Enos thy sins are forgiven thee and thou shalt be blessed And I Enos knew that God could not lie wherefore my guilt was swept away And I said Lord how is it done And he said unto me Because of thy faith in Christ whom thou hast never before heard nor seen And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh wherefore go to thy faith hath made thee whole 7The lesson that has blessed me is in these words Because of thy faith in Christ whom thou hast never before heard nor seen Joseph had faith in Christ to go into the grove and also to pray for release from the powers of Satan He had not yet seen the Father and the Son but he prayed in faith with all the energy of his heart The experience of Enos has taught me the same precious lesson When I pray with faith I have the Savior as my advocate with the Father and I can feel that my prayer reaches heaven Answers come Blessings are received There is peace and joy even in hard times I remember when as the newest member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles I knelt in prayer with Elder David B Haight He was about the age I am now with challenges I now experience myself I remember his voice as he prayed I didn t open my eyes to look but it sounded to me as if he was smiling He spoke with Heavenly Father with joy in his voice I can hear in my mind his happiness when he said In the name of Jesus Christ It sounded to me as if Elder Haight felt the Savior was affirming at that moment the message he had prayed to the Father And I was sure it would be received with a smile Our ability to make our vital contribution to the wonderful continuing Restoration will increase as we grow in our faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior and our Heavenly Father as our loving Father As we pray in faith we become a vital part in the Lord s work as He prepares the world for His Second Coming I pray that we all may find joy in doing the work He invites each of us to perform I testify that Jesus Christ lives This is His Church and kingdom on earth Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration President Russell M Nelson is the Lord s prophet on the earth today He holds all the keys of the priesthood in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints In the name of Jesus Christ amen

I am grateful for the blessing of addressing you the covenant daughters of God Tonight my purpose is to encourage you in the great service to which you are called Yes every daughter of God listening to my voice has received a call from the Lord Jesus Christ Your call began when you were placed into mortality in a place and time chosen for you by a God who knows you perfectly and loves you as His daughter In the spirit world He knew you and taught you and placed you where you would have the opportunity rare in the history of the world to be invited into a baptismal font There you would hear these words spoken by a called servant of Jesus Christ Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Amen 1When you came out of the water you had accepted another call to serve As a new covenant daughter of God you made a promise and received an assignment in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints of which you were then confirmed a member You covenanted with God to take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ to keep His commandments and to serve Him For each one who makes these covenants the service that the Lord calls him or her to do will be suited perfectly to that person The covenant daughters and sons of God however all share one important and joyful call It is to serve others for Him Speaking to sisters President Russell M Nelson gave a wonderful summary of the Lord s call to you to join Him in His work President Nelson described your call in this way The Lord said My work and my glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 So His devoted daughter disciple may truly say My work and my glory is to help my loved ones reach that heavenly goal To help another human being reach one s celestial potential is part of the divine mission of woman As mother teacher or nurturing Saint she molds living clay to the shape of her hopes In partnership with God her divine mission is to help spirits live and souls be lifted This is the measure of her creation It is ennobling edifying and exalting 2You cannot know when or for what length of time your personal mission will be focused on service in calls such as mother leader or ministering sister The Lord out of love does not leave us the choice of the timing duration or sequence of our assignments Yet you know from scripture and living prophets that all of these assignments will come either in this life or in the next to every daughter of God And all of them are preparation for eternal life in loving families the greatest of all the gifts of God 3You will be wise to bend every effort to prepare now with the end in mind That task is made simpler because each of these assignments requires much of the same preparation Let s start with the assignment to be a ministering sister Whether you have that assignment as a 10 year old daughter in a family where the father has died or as a Relief Society president whose town was recently affected by fire or when you are in a hospital recovering from surgery you have a chance to fulfill your call from the Lord to be His ministering daughter Those appear to be very different ministering assignments Yet they all require the preparation of a powerful loving heart a fearless faith that the Lord gives no command save He prepares a way and a desire to go and do for Him 4Because she was prepared the 10 year old daughter put her arms around her widowed mother and prayed to know how to help her family And she keeps at it The Relief Society president had prepared to minister before the unexpected fire in her area She had come to know and love the people Her faith in Jesus Christ had grown over the years from having received answers to her prayers for the Lord to help her in small services for Him Because of her long preparation she was ready and eager to organize her sisters to minister to people and families in distress A sister recovering in a hospital from surgery was prepared to minister to her fellow patients She had spent a lifetime ministering for the Lord to every stranger as if he or she was a neighbor and a friend When she felt in her heart the call to minister in the hospital she served others so bravely and with such love that the other patients began to hope she wouldn t recover too soon In the same way that you prepare to minister you can and must prepare for your call to be a leader for the Lord when it comes It will require faith in Jesus Christ rooted in your deep love of the scriptures to lead people and to teach His word without fear Then you will be prepared to have the Holy Ghost as your constant companion You will be eager to say I will when your counselor in the Young Women presidency says with panic in her voice Sister Alvarez is sick today Who will teach her class It takes much the same preparation for the wonderful day when the Lord calls you to an assignment as a mother But it will also take an even more loving heart than you needed earlier It will take faith in Jesus Christ beyond what has ever before been in your heart And it will take a capacity to pray for the influence direction and comfort of the Holy Ghost beyond what you may have felt was even possible You might reasonably ask how a man of any age can know what mothers need It s a valid question Men can t know everything but we can learn some lessons by revelation from God And we can also learn much by observation when we take the opportunity to seek the Spirit to help us understand what we observe I have been observing Kathleen Johnson Eyring for the 57 years we have been married She is the mother of four boys and two girls To date she has accepted the call to be a mothering influence on more than a hundred direct family members and hundreds more whom she has adopted into her mother heart You remember President Nelson s perfect description of a woman s divine mission including her mission of mothering As mother teacher or nurturing Saint she molds living clay to the shape of her hopes In partnership with God her divine mission is to help spirits live and souls be lifted This is the measure of her creation 5As nearly as I can discern my wife Kathleen has followed that charge given to our Father s daughters The key appears to me to be the words she molds living clay to the shape of her hopes in partnership with God She did not force She molded And she had a template for her hopes and to which she tried to mold those she loved and mothered Her template was the gospel of Jesus Christ as I could see through prayerful observation over the years Becoming a covenant woman in partnership with God is how great and good daughters of God have always mothered led and ministered serving in whatever way and place He has prepared for them I promise that you will find joy in your journey to your heavenly home as you return to Him as a covenant keeping daughter of God I testify that God the Father lives and He loves you He will answer your prayers His Beloved Son leads in every detail The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints President Russell M Nelson is His living prophet And Joseph Smith saw and spoke with God the Father and Jesus Christ in a grove of trees in Palmyra New York I know that is true I also testify that Jesus Christ is your Savior He loves you And through His Atonement you can be purified and lifted to the high and holy callings which will come to you I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters I have prayed for the power to help you in your personal search for happiness Some might feel happy enough already yet surely no one would reject the offer of more happiness Anyone would be eager to accept a guaranteed offer of lasting happiness That is what Heavenly Father His Beloved Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost have offered every spirit child of Heavenly Father who now lives will live or ever has lived in this world That offer is sometimes called the plan of happiness It was so called by the prophet Alma as he taught his son who was mired in the misery of sin Alma knew that wickedness could never be happiness for his son or for any child of Heavenly Father 1He taught his son that increasing in holiness was the only path to happiness He made it plain that greater holiness is made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ cleansing and perfecting us 2 Only by faith in Jesus Christ continuing repentance and keeping covenants are we able to claim the lasting happiness we all yearn to experience and retain My prayer for today is that I may help you understand that greater happiness comes from greater personal holiness so that you will act upon that belief I will then share what I know for myself about what we can do to qualify for that gift of becoming ever more holy The scriptures teach us that among other things we can be sanctified or become more holy when we exercise faith in Christ 3 demonstrate our obedience 4 repent 5 sacrifice for Him 6 receive sacred ordinances and keep our covenants with Him 7 Qualifying for the gift of holiness requires humility 8 meekness 9 and patience 10One experience of wanting more holiness came for me in the Salt Lake Temple I entered the temple for the first time having been told little of what to expect I had seen the words on the building Holiness to the Lord and The House of the Lord I felt a great sense of anticipation Yet I wondered if I was prepared to enter My mother and father walked ahead of me as we entered the temple We were asked to show our recommends certifying our worthiness My parents knew the man at the recommend desk So they lingered a moment to speak with him I went ahead alone into a large space where everything was sparkling white I looked up at a ceiling so high above me it seemed an open sky In that moment a clear impression came to me that I had been there before But then I heard a very soft voice it was not my own The softly spoken words were these You have never been here before You are remembering a moment before you were born You were in a sacred place like this You felt the Savior was about to come into the place where you stood And you felt happiness because you were eager to see Him That experience in the Salt Lake Temple lasted only a moment Yet the memory of it still brings peace joy and quiet happiness I learned many lessons that day One was that the Holy Ghost speaks in a still small voice I can hear Him when there is spiritual peace in my heart He brings a feeling of happiness and assurance that I am becoming more holy And that always brings the happiness I felt in those first moments in a temple of God You have observed in your own life and in the lives of others the miracle of happiness coming from growing holiness becoming more like the Savior In recent weeks I have been at the bedside of people who could face death with full faith in the Savior and with happy countenances One was a man surrounded by his family He and his wife were chatting quietly as my son and I entered I had known them for many years I had seen the Atonement of Jesus Christ work in their lives and in the lives of their family members They had together chosen to end medical efforts to prolong his life There was a quiet feeling as he spoke to us He smiled as he expressed gratitude for the gospel and its purifying effects on him and the family he loved He spoke of his happy years of service in the temple At this man s request my son anointed his head with consecrated oil I sealed the anointing As I did I had a clear impression to tell him that he would soon see his Savior face to face I promised him that he would feel happiness love and the Savior s approval He smiled warmly as we left His last words to me were Tell Kathy I love her My wife Kathleen over many years had encouraged generations of his family to accept the Savior s invitation to come unto Him make and keep sacred covenants and so qualify for the happiness that comes as a result of that greater holiness He died hours later Within weeks of his passing his widow brought a gift to my wife and me She smiled as we talked She said pleasantly I expected that I would feel sad and lonely I feel so happy Do you think that s all right Knowing how much she loved her husband and how both of them had come to know love and serve the Lord I told her that her feelings of happiness were a promised gift because she had by her faithful service been made more holy Her holiness had qualified her for that happiness Some listening today may be wondering Why do I not feel the peace and happiness promised to those who have been faithful I have been faithful through terrible adversity but I don t feel happiness Even the Prophet Joseph Smith faced this test He prayed for relief when he was confined in a jail in Liberty Missouri He had been faithful to the Lord He had grown in holiness Yet he felt happiness had been denied The Lord taught him the lesson of patience we all will need at some time and perhaps for long periods in our mortal testing Here is the Lord s message to His faithful and suffering prophet And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit or into the hands of murderers and the sentence of death passed upon thee if thou be cast into the deep if the billowing surge conspire against thee if fierce winds become thine enemy if the heavens gather blackness and all the elements combine to hedge up the way and above all if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee know thou my son that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good The Son of Man hath descended below them all Art thou greater than he Therefore hold on thy way and the priesthood shall remain with thee for their bounds are set they cannot pass Thy days are known and thy years shall not be numbered less therefore fear not what man can do for God shall be with you forever and ever 11That was the same instructive lesson the Lord gave Job who paid a heavy price to allow the Atonement to make him more holy We know that Job was holy from the introduction we have of him There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evil 12Then Job lost his wealth his family and even his health You might remember that Job doubted that his greater holiness gained through greater adversity had qualified him for greater happiness It seemed to Job that holiness had brought misery Yet the Lord gave Job the same correcting lesson He gave Joseph Smith He let Job see his heartbreaking situation with spiritual eyes He said Gird up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding Who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy 13Then after Job repented of calling God unfair Job was permitted to see his trials in a higher and holier way He had repented Then Job answered the Lord and said I know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not Hear I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee Wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes 14After Job repented and so became more holy the Lord blessed him beyond all he had lost But perhaps the greatest blessing for Job was to have increased in holiness through adversity and repentance He was qualified to have greater happiness in the days he had yet to live Greater holiness will not come simply by asking for it It will come by doing what is needed for God to change us President Russell M Nelson has given what seems to me the best counsel of how to move along the covenant path to greater holiness He pointed the way when he urged Experience the strengthening power of daily repentance of doing and being a little better each day When we choose to repent we choose to change We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy the joy of redemption in Him When we choose to repent we choose to become more like Jesus Christ President Nelson went on to give us this encouragement in our efforts to become holier The Lord does not expect perfection from us at this point But He does expect us to become increasingly pure Daily repentance is the pathway to purity 15President Dallin H Oaks in an earlier conference address also helped me see more clearly how we grow in holiness and how we can know we are moving toward it He said How do we achieve spirituality How do we attain that degree of holiness where we can have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost How do we come to view and evaluate things of this world with the perspective of eternity 16President Oaks s answer begins with greater faith in Jesus Christ as our loving Savior That leads us to seek forgiveness every day and to remember Him every day by keeping His commandments That greater faith in Jesus Christ comes as we feast daily on His word The hymn More Holiness Give Me suggests a way to pray for help in becoming more holy The author wisely suggests that the holiness we seek is a gift from a loving God granted over time after all we can do You remember the last verse More purity give me More strength to o ercome More freedom from earth stains More longing for home More fit for the kingdom More used would I be More blessed and holy More Savior like thee 17Whatever our personal circumstance wherever we may be on the covenant path home may our prayers for greater holiness be answered I know that as our petition is granted our happiness will increase It may come slowly but it will come I have that assurance from a loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ I testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God that President Russell M Nelson is our living prophet today God the Father lives and loves us He wants us to come home to Him in families Our loving Savior invites us to follow Him on our journey there They have prepared the way In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Many times I have heard priesthood leaders give thanks for the sustaining faith of those they serve From the emotion in their voices you know their gratitude is deep and real My purpose today is to convey the Lord s appreciation for your sustaining His servants in His Church And it is also to encourage you to exercise and grow in that power to sustain others with your faith Before you were born you demonstrated such power Think back to what we know of the spirit world before we were born Our Heavenly Father presented a plan for His children We were there Lucifer our spirit brother opposed the plan that would allow us freedom to choose Jehovah the Beloved Son of Heavenly Father sustained the plan Lucifer led a rebellion Jehovah s sustaining voice prevailed and He volunteered to be our Savior The fact that you are in mortality now assures us that you sustained the Father and the Savior It took faith in Jesus Christ to sustain the plan of happiness and Jesus Christ s place in it when you knew so little of the challenges that you would face in mortality Your faith to sustain servants of God has been at the heart of your happiness in this life as well When you accepted a missionary s challenge to pray to know that the Book of Mormon was the word of God you had the faith to sustain a servant of the Lord When you accepted the invitation to be baptized you sustained a humble servant of God When you let someone place hands on your head and say Receive the Holy Ghost you sustained him as a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood Since that day you have by serving faithfully sustained each person who has conferred the priesthood upon you and each who has ordained you to an office in that priesthood Early in your priesthood experience each sustaining was a simple event of trusting a servant of God Now many of you have moved up to a place where to sustain requires more You choose whether to sustain all whom the Lord calls in whatever the Lord has called them That choice happens in conferences all over the world It has happened in this one In such meetings names of men and women servants of God are read and you are invited to raise your hand to sustain You can withhold your sustaining vote or you can pledge your sustaining faith By raising your hand to sustain you make a promise You make a promise with God whose servants these are that you will sustain them These are imperfect human beings as are you Keeping your promises will take unshakable faith that the Lord called them Keeping those promises will also bring eternal happiness Not keeping them will bring sorrow to you and to those you love and even losses beyond your power to imagine You may have been asked or you will be whether you sustain your bishop stake president the General Authorities and the General Officers of the Church It may happen as you are asked to sustain officers and leaders in a conference Sometimes it will be in an interview with a bishop or stake president My counsel is that you ask those questions of yourself beforehand with careful and prayerful thought As you do you might look back on your recent thoughts words and deeds Try to remember and frame the answers you will give when the Lord interviews you knowing that someday He will You could prepare by asking yourself questions like the following Have I thought or spoken of human weakness in the people I have pledged to sustain Have I looked for evidence that the Lord is leading them Have I conscientiously and loyally followed their leadership Have I spoken about the evidence I can see that they are God s servants Do I pray for them regularly by name and with feelings of love Those questions will for most of us lead to some uneasiness and a need to repent We are commanded by God not to judge others unrighteously but in practice we find that hard to avoid Almost everything we do in working with people leads us to evaluate them And in almost every aspect of our lives we compare ourselves with others We may do so for many reasons some of them reasonable but it often leads us to be critical President George Q Cannon gave a warning that I pass on to you as my own I believe he spoke the truth God has chosen His servants He claims it as His prerogative to condemn them if they need condemnation He has not given it to us individually to censure and condemn them No man however strong he may be in the faith however high in the Priesthood can speak evil of the Lord s anointed and find fault with God s authority on the earth without incurring His displeasure The Holy Spirit will withdraw himself from such a man and he will go into darkness This being the case do you not see how important it is that we should be careful 1My observation is that the members of the Church across the world are generally loyal to each other and to those who preside over them There are however improvements we could and must make We could rise higher in our power to sustain each other It will take faith and effort Here are four suggestions I make for us to act on at this conference We could identify specific actions the speakers recommend and start today to carry them out As we do our power to sustain them will increase We could pray for them as they speak that the Holy Ghost will carry their words into the hearts of specific people we love When we learn later that our prayer was answered our power to sustain those leaders will increase We could pray that specific speakers will be blessed and magnified as they give their messages When we see that they were magnified we will grow in our faith to sustain them and it will endure We could listen for messages from the speakers that come as an answer to our personal prayers for help When the answers come and they will we will grow in our faith to sustain all the Lord s servants In addition to improving in sustaining those who serve in the Church we will learn that there is another setting in which we can increase in such power There it can bring even greater blessings to us It is in the home and family I speak to the younger priesthood holder who lives in a home with his father Let me tell you from my own experience what it means for a father to feel your sustaining faith He may look confident to you But he faces more challenges than you know At times he can t see the way through the problems before him Your admiration for him will help him some Your love for him will help even more But the thing that will help the most is sincere words like these Dad I ve prayed for you and I have felt that the Lord is going to help you Everything will work out I know it will Words such as those also have power in the other direction father to son When a son has made a serious mistake perhaps in a spiritual matter he may feel that he has failed As his father in that moment you may be surprised when after you pray to know what to do the Holy Ghost puts these words into your mouth Son I m with you all the way The Lord loves you With His help you can make it back I know that you can and that you will I love you In the priesthood quorum and in the family increased faith to sustain each other is the way we build the Zion the Lord wants us to create With His help we can and we will It will take learning to love the Lord with all our heart might mind and strength and to love each other as we love ourselves As we grow in that pure love of Christ our hearts soften That love will humble us and lead us to repent Our confidence in the Lord and in each other will grow And then we will move toward becoming one as the Lord promises we can 2I testify that Heavenly Father knows and loves you Jesus is the living Christ This is His Church We hold His priesthood He will honor our efforts to grow in our power to exercise it and to sustain each other I so witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters I am grateful to have been invited to speak to you in this 189th Annual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints On this date in 1830 Joseph Smith organized the Church under the direction of the Lord It was done in the Whitmer family home near Fayette New York There were six members and about 50 other interested people there that day Although I don t know what the Prophet Joseph said or how he looked when he stood before that little group I know what those people with faith in Jesus Christ felt They felt the Holy Ghost and they felt that they were in a holy place They surely felt that they were united as one That miraculous feeling is what we all want in our homes It is a feeling that comes from being as Paul described spiritually minded 1My purpose today is to teach what I know of how we can qualify for that feeling more often and invite it to last longer in our families As you know from experience that is not easy to do Contention pride and sin have to be kept at bay The pure love of Christ must come into the hearts of those in our family Adam and Eve Lehi and Sariah and other parents we know from scripture found that to be a hard challenge Yet there are encouraging examples of sustained felicity in families and homes to reassure us And those examples let us see the way it can happen for us and our families You remember the account from 4 Nephi And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people And there were no envyings nor strifes nor tumults nor whoredoms nor lyings nor murders nor any manner of lasciviousness and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God There were no robbers nor murderers neither were there Lamanites nor any manner of ites but they were in one the children of Christ and heirs to the kingdom of God And how blessed were they For the Lord did bless them in all their doings yea even they were blessed and prospered until an hundred and ten years had passed away and the first generation from Christ had passed away and there was no contention in all the land 2As you know that happy time did not endure forever The account in 4 Nephi describes the eventual symptoms of spiritual decline among a group of good people It is a pattern that has appeared over the ages in entire peoples in congregations and most sadly in families By studying that pattern we can see how we might protect and even increase the feelings of love in our family Here is the pattern of decline that appeared after 200 years of living in the perfect peace the gospel brings Pride crept in The people stopped sharing what they had with each other They began to see themselves in classes above or below each other They began to diminish in their faith in Jesus Christ They began to hate They began to commit all kinds of sin Wise parents will be alert enough to notice those symptoms when they appear among their family members They will of course be concerned But they will know that the underlying cause is the influence of Satan trying to lead good people down a path to sin and thus to lose the influence of the Holy Ghost So the wise parent will see that opportunity lies in leading each child and themselves to accept more fully the Lord s invitation to come unto Him You could have limited success by calling a child to repent for instance of pride You might try persuading children to share what they have more generously You could ask them to stop feeling they are better than someone else in the family But then you come to the symptom I described earlier as They began to diminish in their faith in Jesus Christ There is the key to leading your family to rise to that spiritual place you want for them and for you to be there with them As you help them grow in faith that Jesus Christ is their loving Redeemer they will feel a desire to repent As they do humility will begin to replace pride As they begin to feel what the Lord has given them they will want to share more generously Rivalry for prominence or recognition will diminish Hate will be driven out by love And finally like it did for the people converted by King Benjamin the desire to do good will fortify them against temptation to sin King Benjamin s people testified that they had no more disposition to do evil 3So building faith in Jesus Christ is the beginning of reversing spiritual decline in your family and in your home That faith is more likely to bring repentance than your preaching against each symptom of spiritual decline You will best lead by example Family members and others must see you growing in your own faith in Jesus Christ and in His gospel You have recently been provided great help Parents in the Church have been blessed with an inspired curriculum for families and individuals As you use it you will build your faith and the faith of your children in the Lord Jesus Christ Growing in FaithYour faith in the Savior has grown as you followed President Russell M Nelson s suggestion to reread the Book of Mormon You marked passages and words that referred to the Savior Your faith in Jesus Christ grew But like a new plant such faith in Jesus Christ will wither unless you find continued resolve to ponder and pray to increase it Your example of growing in faith may not be followed by all members of your family now But take heart from the experience of Alma the Younger In his painful need for repentance and forgiveness he remembered his father s faith in Jesus Christ Your children may remember your faith in the Savior at a moment when they desperately need repentance Alma said of such a moment And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins behold I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ a Son of God to atone for the sins of the world Now as my mind caught hold upon this thought I cried within my heart O Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me who am in the gall of bitterness and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death And now behold when I thought this I could remember my pains no more yea I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more 4Praying with LoveIn addition to your example of growing in faith your praying as a family can play a crucial part in making home a sacred place One person is usually chosen as voice to pray for the family When the prayer is clearly to God in behalf of the people kneeling and listening faith grows in all of them They can feel expressions of love for Heavenly Father and for the Savior And when the person who prays mentions those who are kneeling in that circle who are in need all can feel love for them and for each member of the family Even when family members are not living in the home prayer can build bonds of love Prayer in the family can reach across the world More than once I have learned that a family member far away was praying at the same moment for the same thing as I was For me the old saying The family that prays together stays together could be expanded to The family that prays together is together even when they are far apart Teaching Early RepentanceBecause none of us is perfect and feelings are easily hurt families can become sacred sanctuaries only as we repent early and sincerely Parents can set an example Harsh words or unkind thoughts can be repented of quickly and sincerely A simple I am sorry can heal wounds and invite both forgiveness and love The Prophet Joseph Smith was a model for us as he dealt with vicious attacks with traitors and even with disagreements in his family He forgave quickly even though he knew the attacker might attack again He asked for forgiveness and he gave it freely 5Cultivating the Missionary SpiritThe sons of Mosiah were determined to offer the gospel to everyone This desire came from their personal experience with repentance They could not bear the thought of any person suffering the effects of sin as they had So they faced years of rejection hardship and danger to offer the gospel of Jesus Christ to their enemies In the process they found joy in the many who repented and experienced the joy of forgiveness through the Atonement of Jesus Christ Our family members will grow in their desire to share the gospel as they feel the joy of forgiveness That can come even as they renew covenants when they partake of the sacrament The missionary spirit will grow in our homes as children and parents feel the joy of forgiveness in the sacrament service By their example of reverence both parents and children can help each other feel that joy That joy can go far in turning our homes into missionary training centers All might not serve missions but all will feel the desire to share the gospel which has brought them to feel forgiveness and peace And whether currently serving full time or not all can feel joy in offering the gospel to others Visiting the TempleFor both parents and children the temple is the best opportunity to gain a feeling for and a love of heavenly places That is especially true when the children are young Children are born with the Light of Christ Even a baby can feel that a temple is sacred Because parents love their little children the temple represents for them the hope that they can have their children to love in their eternal family forever Some of you have photographs of temples in your homes As temples are being added across the earth it is possible for many parents to visit temple grounds with their families A few may even be able to attend open houses when temples are built Parents can ask children how they felt to be near or in a temple Every parent can bear testimony of what a temple has meant to him or her President Ezra Taft Benson who loved temples spoke often of watching his mother carefully press her temple clothing 6 He spoke of his memory as a boy watching his family as they left his home to attend the temple When he was the President of the Church he attended the temple the same day each week He always did the temple work for an ancestor It came largely from the example of his parents My TestimonyYou will find some of your greatest joys in your efforts to make your home a place of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and a place that is permeated with love the pure love of Christ The Restoration of the gospel started with a humble question pondered in a humble home and it can continue in each of our homes as we continue to establish and practice gospel principles there This has been my hope and my deepest desire since I was a little boy You have all had glimpses of such homes Many of you have with the Lord s help created them Some have tried with full heart for that blessing yet it has not been granted My promise to you is one that a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles once made to me I had said to him that because of choices some in our extended family had made I doubted that we could be together in the world to come He said as well as I can remember You are worrying about the wrong problem You just live worthy of the celestial kingdom and the family arrangements will be more wonderful than you can imagine I believe that he would extend that happy hope to any of us in mortality who have done all we can to qualify ourselves and our family members for eternal life I know that Heavenly Father s plan is a plan of happiness I testify that His plan makes it possible for each of us who has done the best we can to be sealed in a family forever I know that the priesthood keys restored to Joseph Smith were passed on in an unbroken line to President Russell M Nelson Those keys make possible the sealing of families today I know that Heavenly Father loves us His spirit children with a perfect love I know that because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can repent be cleansed and become worthy to live in loving families forever with our Heavenly Father and with His Beloved Son Jesus Christ I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen

My beloved sisters it is wonderful to meet with you This is an exciting time in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints The Lord is pouring out knowledge on His Church as He promised that He would You remember what He said How long can rolling waters remain impure What power shall stay the heavens As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course or to turn it up stream as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter day Saints 1Part of the Lord s current sharing of knowledge relates to accelerating His pouring out eternal truth on the heads and into the hearts of His people He has made clear that the daughters of Heavenly Father will play a primary role in that miraculous acceleration One evidence of the miracle is His leading His living prophet to put far greater emphasis on gospel instruction in the home and within the family You might ask How does that make faithful sisters a primary force to help the Lord pour out knowledge on His Saints The Lord gives the answer in The Family A Proclamation to the World You remember the words but you may see new meaning and recognize that the Lord foresaw these exciting changes which are now occurring In the proclamation He gave sisters charge to be the principal gospel educators in the family in these words Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children 2 This includes the nurture of gospel truth and knowledge The proclamation goes on Fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners 3 They are equal partners equal in their potential for spiritual growth and for acquiring knowledge and so are unified by helping each other They are equal in their divine destiny to be exalted together In fact men and women cannot be exalted alone Why then does a daughter of God in a united and equal relationship receive the primary responsibility to nourish with the most important nutrient all must receive a knowledge of truth coming from heaven As nearly as I can see that has been the Lord s way since families were created in this world For instance it was Eve who received the knowledge that Adam needed to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge for them to keep all of God s commandments and to form a family I do not know why it came to Eve first but Adam and Eve were perfectly united when the knowledge was poured out on Adam Another example of the Lord s using the nurturing gifts of women is the way He strengthened the sons of Helaman I get a lump in my throat when I read the account and remember my own mother s quiet words of assurance as I left home for military service Helaman recorded They had been taught by their mothers that if they did not doubt God would deliver them And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers saying We do not doubt our mothers knew it 4While I do not know all the Lord s reasons for giving primary responsibility for nurturing in the family to faithful sisters I believe it has to do with your capacity to love It takes great love to feel the needs of someone else more than your own That is the pure love of Christ for the person you nurture That feeling of charity comes from the person chosen to be the nurturer having qualified for the effects of the Atonement of Jesus Christ The motto of the Relief Society which my own mother exemplified seems to me inspired Charity Never Faileth As daughters of God you have an innate and great capacity to sense the needs of others and to love That in turn makes you more susceptible to the whisperings of the Spirit The Spirit can then guide what you think what you say and what you do to nurture people so the Lord may pour knowledge truth and courage upon them You sisters hearing my voice are each in a unique place in your journey through life Some are young girls in a general women s session for the first time Some are young women preparing to be the nurturers God would have them be Some are newly married who have not yet had children others are young mothers with one or more Some are mothers of teenagers and others with children in the mission field Some have children who have become weakened in faith and are far from home Some live alone with no faithful companion Some are grandmothers Yet whatever your personal circumstance you are part a key part of the family of God and of your own family whether in the future in this world or in the spirit world Your trust from God is to nurture as many of His and your family members as you can with your love and your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ Your practical challenge is to know whom to nurture how and when You need the Lord s help He knows others hearts and He knows when they are ready to accept your nurturing Your prayer of faith will be your key to success You can depend upon receiving His guidance He gave this encouragement Ask the Father in my name in faith believing that you shall receive and you shall have the Holy Ghost which manifesteth all things which are expedient 5In addition to prayer serious study of the scriptures will be part of your growing power to nurture Here is the promise Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man 6So you will take more time to pray to ponder and to meditate on spiritual matters You will have knowledge of truth poured out upon you and grow in your power to nurture others in your family There will be times when you feel that your progress in learning how better to nurture is slow It will take faith to endure The Savior sent you this encouragement Wherefore be not weary in well doing for ye are laying the foundation of a great work And out of small things proceedeth that which is great Behold the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days 7Your presence tonight is evidence that you are willing to accept the Lord s invitation to nurture others That is true even for the youngest here tonight You can know whom to nurture in your family If you pray with real intent a name or a face will come to your mind If you pray to know what to do or what to say you will feel an answer Each time you obey your power to nurture will grow You will be preparing for the day when you will nurture your own children Mothers of teenagers could pray to know how to nurture a son or daughter who seems unresponsive to nurturing You might pray to know who could have the spiritual influence your child needs and would accept God hears and answers such heartfelt prayers of worried mothers and He sends help Also a grandmother here tonight may feel heartache caused by the strains and difficulties of her children and grandchildren You might take courage and direction from the experiences of families in the scriptures From the time of Eve and Adam through Father Israel and on to every family in the Book of Mormon there is one sure lesson about what to do about the sorrows of unresponsive children never stop loving We have the encouraging example of the Savior as He nourished the rebellious spirit children of His Heavenly Father Even when they and we cause pain the Savior s hand is still outstretched 8 He spoke in 3 Nephi of His spiritual sisters and brothers whom He had tried unsuccessfully to nurture O ye people who are of the house of Israel how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and have nourished you 9For sisters in every stage of life s journey in every family situation and across every culture the Savior is your perfect example of how you will play a major part in His move to place greater emphasis on gospel learning in the home and family You will bring your inherent feeling of charity into changes in activities and practices in your family That will bring greater spiritual growth When you pray with and for family members you will feel your and the Savior s love for them That will become more and more your spiritual gift as you seek it Your family members will feel it as you pray with greater faith When the family gathers to read scriptures aloud you will already have read them and prayed over them to prepare yourself You will have found moments to pray for the Spirit to enlighten your mind Then when it is your turn to read family members will feel your love for God and for His word They will be nurtured by Him and by His Spirit The same outpouring can come in any family gathering if you pray and plan for it It may take effort and time but it will bring miracles I remember a lesson my mother taught when I was little I can still see in my mind the colored map she had made of the travels of the Apostle Paul I wonder how she found the time and energy to do that And to this day I am blessed by her love for that faithful Apostle You will each find ways to contribute to the outpouring of truth upon your families in the Lord s restored Church Each of you will pray study and ponder to know what your unique contribution will be But this I know each of you equally yoked with sons of God will be a major part of a miracle of gospel learning and living that will hasten the gathering of Israel and will prepare God s family for the glorious return of the Lord Jesus Christ In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters I am grateful for the opportunity to speak with you This conference has been uplifting and edifying for me The music sung and the words spoken have been carried to our hearts by the Holy Ghost I pray that what I say will be conveyed to you by that same Spirit Many years ago I was first counselor to a district president in the eastern United States More than once as we were driving to our little branches he said to me Hal when you meet someone treat them as if they were in serious trouble and you will be right more than half the time Not only was he right but I have learned over the years that he was too low in his estimate Today I wish to encourage you in the troubles you face Our mortal life is designed by a loving God to be a test and source of growth for each of us You remember God s words regarding His children at the Creation of the world And we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them 1Since the beginning the tests have not been easy We face trials that come from having mortal bodies All of us live in a world where Satan s war against truth and against our personal happiness is becoming more intense The world and your life can seem to you to be in increasing commotion My reassurance is this the loving God who allowed these tests for you also designed a sure way to pass through them Heavenly Father so loved the world that He sent His Beloved Son to help us 2 His Son Jesus Christ gave His life for us Jesus Christ bore in Gethsemane and on the cross the weight of all our sins He experienced all the sorrows the pains and the effects of our sins so that He could comfort and strengthen us through every test in life 3You remember that the Lord said to His servants The Father and I are one I am in the Father and the Father in me and inasmuch as ye have received me ye are in me and I in you Wherefore I am in your midst and I am the good shepherd and the stone of Israel He that buildeth upon this rock shall never fall 4Our prophet President Russell M Nelson has also given that same assurance Moreover he described a way we might build upon that rock and put the Lord s name upon our hearts to guide us through our trials He said You who may be momentarily disheartened remember life is not meant to be easy Trials must be borne and grief endured along the way As you remember that with God nothing shall be impossible Luke 1 37 know that He is your Father You are a son or daughter created in His image entitled through your worthiness to receive revelation to help with your righteous endeavors You may take upon you the holy name of the Lord You can qualify to speak in the sacred name of God see D C 1 20 5President Nelson s words remind us of the promise found in the sacramental prayer a promise our Heavenly Father fulfills as we do what we in turn promise Listen to the words O God the Eternal Father we ask thee in the name of thy Son Jesus Christ to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son and witness unto thee O God the Eternal Father that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them that they may always have his Spirit to be with them Amen 6Each time we say the word amen when that prayer is offered on our behalf we pledge that by partaking of the bread we are willing to take upon us the holy name of Jesus Christ always remember Him and keep His commandments In turn we are promised that we may always have His Spirit to be with us Because of these promises the Savior is the rock upon which we can stand safely and without fear in every storm we face As I have pondered the covenant words and corresponding blessings promised I have wondered what it means to be willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ President Dallin H Oaks explains It is significant that when we partake of the sacrament we do not witness that we take upon us the name of Jesus Christ We witness that we are willing to do so See D C 20 77 The fact that we only witness to our willingness suggests that something else must happen before we actually take that sacred name upon us in the most important sense 7The statement that we are willing to take upon us His name tells us that while we first took the Savior s name when we were baptized taking His name is not finished at baptism We must work continually to take His name throughout our lives including when we renew covenants at the sacrament table and make covenants in the Lord s holy temples So two crucial questions for each of us become What must I be doing to take His name upon me and How will I know when I am making progress The statement of President Nelson suggests one helpful answer He said that we could take the name of the Savior upon us and that we could speak for Him When we speak for Him we serve Him For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart 8Speaking for Him requires a prayer of faith It takes a fervent prayer to Heavenly Father to learn what words we could speak to help the Savior in His work We must qualify for the promise Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same 9Yet it takes more than speaking for Him to take His name upon us There are feelings in our hearts we must have to qualify as His servants The prophet Mormon described the feelings that qualify us and enable us to take His name upon us These feelings include faith hope and charity which is the pure love of Christ Mormon explained For I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church And again my beloved brethren I would speak unto you concerning hope How is it that ye can attain unto faith save ye shall have hope And what is it that ye shall hope for Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection to be raised unto life eternal and this because of your faith in him according to the promise Wherefore if a man have faith he must needs have hope for without faith there cannot be any hope And again behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope save he shall be meek and lowly of heart If so his faith and hope is vain for none is acceptable before God save the meek and lowly in heart and if a man be meek and lowly in heart and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ he must needs have charity for if he have not charity he is nothing wherefore he must needs have charity After describing charity Mormon goes on to say But charity is the pure love of Christ and it endureth forever and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day it shall be well with him Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure Amen 10My testimony is that the Savior is putting His name in your hearts For many of you your faith in Him is increasing You are feeling more hope and optimism And you are feeling the pure love of Christ for others and for yourself I see it in missionaries serving all over the world I see it in members who are speaking to their friends and family members about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Men women young people and even children are ministering out of love for the Savior and for their neighbors At the first report of disasters across the world members make plans to go to the rescue sometimes across oceans without being asked They sometimes find it hard to wait until the devastated areas can receive them I realize that some of you listening today may feel that your faith and hope are being overcome by your troubles And you may yearn to feel love Brothers and sisters the Lord has opportunities near you to feel and to share His love You can pray with confidence for the Lord to lead you to love someone for Him He answers the prayers of meek volunteers like you You will feel the love of God for you and for the person you serve for Him As you help children of God in their troubles your own troubles will seem lighter Your faith and your hope will be strengthened I am an eyewitness of that truth Over a lifetime my wife has spoken for the Lord and served people for Him As I ve mentioned before one of our bishops once said to me I m amazed Every time I hear of a person in the ward who is in trouble I hurry to help Yet by the time I arrive it seems that your wife has always already been there That has been true in all the places we have lived for 56 years Now she can speak only a few words a day She is visited by people she loved for the Lord Every night and morning I sing hymns with her and we pray I have to be voice in the prayers and in the songs Sometimes I can see her mouthing the words of the hymns She prefers children s songs The sentiment she seems to like best is summarized in the song I m Trying to Be like Jesus 11The other day after singing the words of the chorus Love one another as Jesus loves you Try to show kindness in all that you do she said softly but clearly Try try try I think that she will find when she sees Him that our Savior has put His name into her heart and that she has become like Him He is carrying her through her troubles now as He will carry you through yours I bear you my witness that the Savior knows and loves you He knows your name as you know His He knows your troubles He has experienced them By His Atonement He has overcome the world By your being willing to take His name upon you you will lift the burdens of countless others And you will find in time that you know the Savior better and that you love Him more His name will be in your heart and fixed in your memory It is the name by which you will be called I so witness with gratitude for His loving kindness to me to my loved ones and to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen

My beloved brethren I am grateful for the privilege of speaking to you in this historic general conference We have sustained President Russell M Nelson as the 17th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints As I have had the blessing of working with him each day I have felt a confirmation of the Spirit that President Nelson is called of God to lead the Lord s true Church It is also my witness that the Lord has called Elder Gerrit W Gong and Elder Ulisses Soares to serve as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles I love and sustain them They will by their ministry bless lives across the world and across generations This conference is historic for yet another reason President Nelson has announced an inspired step forward in the Lord s organized plan for His Church That plan includes a new structure for priesthood quorums in wards and stakes so that we may better fulfill our priesthood responsibilities Those responsibilities all have to do with our priesthood care of our Father s children The Lord s plan for His Saints to provide loving care has taken many forms over the years In the early days of Nauvoo the Prophet Joseph Smith needed an organized way to care for the flood of largely impoverished converts coming into the city Four of my great grandparents were among them the Eyrings Bennions Romneys and Smiths The Prophet organized the care of those Saints by geography In Illinois those divisions of the city were called wards As the Saints moved across the plains their care for each other was organized in companies One of my paternal great grandfathers was returning from his mission in what is now Oklahoma when he met a company on the trail He was so weak with disease that he and his companion were on their backs in a little wagon The leader of the company sent two young women to help whoever might be in that forlorn wagon One of them a young sister who had been converted in Switzerland took a look at one of the missionaries and felt compassion He was saved by that company of Saints He recovered enough to walk the rest of the way to the Salt Lake Valley with his young rescuer by his side They fell in love and married He became my great grandfather Henry Eyring and she my great grandmother Maria Bommeli Eyring Years later when people remarked at the great difficulty of moving across a continent she said Oh no it wasn t hard While we walked we talked the whole way about what a miracle it was that we had both found the true gospel of Jesus Christ It was the happiest time I can remember Since then the Lord has used a variety of ways to help His Saints care for each other Now He has blessed us with strengthened and unified quorums at the ward and stake levels quorums that work in coordination with all ward organizations Municipal wards companies and strengthened quorums have all required at least two things to be successful in the Lord s intent to have His Saints care for each other in the way He cares for them They succeed when the Saints feel the love of Christ for each other above their self interest The scriptures call it charity the pure love of Christ Moroni 7 47 And they succeed when the Holy Ghost guides the caregiver to know what the Lord knows is best for the person whom He is trying to help Time after time in recent weeks members of the Church have acted in my presence as if somehow they had anticipated what the Lord was going to do as has been announced here today Let me give you just two examples One a simple sacrament meeting talk by a 14 year old teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood who understands what priesthood holders can accomplish in their service for the Lord Second a Melchizedek Priesthood holder who with the love of Christ was inspired to serve a family First let me give you the words of the young man speaking to a ward sacrament meeting I was there Try to remember what you were like when you were 14 years old and listen to hear him say more than so young a man could reasonably know I have really liked being a member of the teachers quorum in our ward since I turned 14 last year A teacher still has all the responsibilities of a deacon plus some new ones Since some of us are teachers others will be someday and everyone in the Church is blessed by the priesthood so it s important for all of us to know more about the duties of a teacher First of all Doctrine and Covenants 20 53 says The teacher s duty is to watch over the church always and be with and strengthen them Next Doctrine and Covenants 20 54 55 says And see that there is no iniquity in the church neither hardness with each other neither lying backbiting nor evil speaking And see that the church meet together often and also see that all the members do their duty The young man continued The Lord is telling us it s our responsibility to not only care for the Church but to also care for the people within the Church the way that Christ would because this is His Church If we are trying to keep the commandments be kind to each other be honest be good friends and enjoy being together then we will be able to have the Spirit with us and know what Heavenly Father wants us to do If we don t then we can t fulfill our calling He went on to say When a teacher chooses to set the right example by being a good home teacher greeting the members at church preparing the sacrament helping at home and being a peacemaker he s choosing to honor his priesthood and fulfill his calling Being a good teacher doesn t only mean being responsible when we are at church or at Church activities The Apostle Paul taught Be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity 1 Timothy 4 12 Then the young man said No matter where we are or what we are doing we can be a good example of righteousness at all times and in all places My dad and I home teach the Browns 1 Every time we go over there I have a great time visiting and getting to know them One thing I really like about the Browns is whenever we go over there they are all willing to listen and they always have good stories to share When we know people in the ward well because of home teaching it makes it easier to do the next duty of a teacher and that s greeting the members at church Helping people feel welcome and included at church helps all the members of the ward feel loved and prepared to take the sacrament After greeting members who have come to church teachers help each Sunday by preparing the sacrament I really enjoy passing and preparing the sacrament in this ward because everyone is so reverent I always feel the Spirit when I prepare and pass the sacrament It s a real blessing to me that I m able to do it every Sunday Some service like passing the sacrament is something people see and they thank us for doing it but other service like preparing the sacrament is usually done without anyone noticing It isn t important if people see us serving what s important is that the Lord knows we have served Him As teachers we should always try to strengthen the Church our friends and our family by fulfilling our priesthood responsibilities It s not always easy but the Lord gives no commandments to us save he shall prepare a way for us to accomplish the thing which he commandeth 1 Nephi 3 7 As that young man concluded I continued to be amazed at his maturity and wisdom He summarized by saying I know we will become better if we choose to follow Jesus Christ Another story of priesthood service was told a month ago in a ward sacrament meeting Again I was there In this case the seasoned Melchizedek Priesthood holder didn t know as he spoke that he was describing exactly what the Lord desires to happen with strengthened priesthood quorums Here is the gist of his account He and a home teaching companion were assigned to serve seven families Almost all of them did not want visits When the home teachers went to their apartments they refused to answer the door When they telephoned they did not get an answer When they left a message the call was not returned This senior companion finally resorted to a letter writing ministry He even began to use bright yellow envelopes in the hope of getting a response One of the seven families was a less active single sister who had emigrated from Europe She had two young children After many attempts to contact her he received a text message She abruptly informed him that she was too busy to meet with home teachers She had two jobs and was in the military as well Her primary job was that of a police officer and her career goal was to become a detective and then return to her native country and continue her work there The home teacher never was able to visit with her in her home He periodically texted her Every month he sent a handwritten letter supplemented with holiday cards for each child He received no response But she knew who her home teachers were how to contact them and that they would persist in their priesthood service Then one day he received an urgent text from her She desperately needed help She did not know who the bishop was but she did know her home teachers In a few days she had to leave the state for a monthlong military training exercise She could not take her children with her Her mother who was going to care for her children had just flown to Europe to care for her husband who had a medical emergency This less active single sister had enough money to buy a ticket to Europe for her youngest child but not for her 12 year old son Eric 2 She asked her home teacher if he could find a good LDS family to take Eric into their home for the next 30 days The home teacher texted back that he would do his best He then contacted his priesthood leaders The bishop who was the presiding high priest gave him approval to approach members of the ward council including the Relief Society president The Relief Society president quickly found four good LDS families with children about Eric s age who would take him into their homes for a week at a time Over the next month these families fed Eric found room for him in their already crowded apartments or small homes took him on their previously planned summer family activities brought him to church included him in their family home evenings and on and on The families with boys Eric s age included him in their deacons quorum meetings and activities During this 30 day period Eric was in church every Sunday for the first time in his life After his mother came home from her training Eric continued to attend church usually with one of these four volunteer LDS families or others who had befriended him including his mother s visiting teachers In time he was ordained a deacon and began passing the sacrament regularly Now let us look into Eric s future We will not be surprised if he becomes a leader in the Church in his mother s home country when his family returns there all because of Saints who worked together in unity under the direction of a bishop to serve out of charity in their hearts and with the power of the Holy Ghost We know that charity is essential for us to be saved in the kingdom of God Moroni wrote Except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God Moroni 10 21 see also Ether 12 34 We also know that charity is a gift bestowed upon us after all we can do We must pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that we may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ Moroni 7 48 It seems to me that we receive the Holy Spirit best when we are focused on serving others That is why we have the priesthood responsibility to serve for the Savior When we are engaged in service to others we think less about ourselves and the Holy Ghost can more readily come to us and help us in our lifelong quest to have the gift of charity bestowed upon us I bear you my witness that the Lord has already begun a great step forward in His plan for us to become even more inspired and charitable in our priesthood ministering service I am grateful for His love which He so generously gives us I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you on the Lord s Sabbath in the general conference of His Church at this Easter season I thank our Heavenly Father for the gift of His Beloved Son who came voluntarily to earth to be our Redeemer I am grateful to know that He atoned for our sins and rose in the Resurrection Every day I am blessed to know that because of His Atonement I may someday be resurrected to live forever in a loving family I know those things by the only way any of us can know them The Holy Ghost has spoken to my mind and heart that they are true not just once but often I have needed that continuing comfort We all experience tragedy during which we need the reassurance of the Spirit I felt it one day as I stood with my father in a hospital We watched my mother take a few shallow breaths and then no more As we looked on her face she was smiling as the pain left After a few silent moments my father spoke first He said A little girl has gone home He said it softly He seemed to be at peace He was reporting something he knew was true He quietly began to gather Mother s personal things He went out into the hospital hallway to thank each of the nurses and doctors who had ministered to her for days My father had the companionship of the Holy Ghost at that moment to feel to know and to do what he did that day He had received the promise as many have That they may have his Spirit to be with them D C 20 79 My hope today is to increase your desire and your ability to receive the Holy Ghost Remember He is the third member of the Godhead The Father and the Son are resurrected beings The Holy Ghost is a person of spirit See D C 130 22 It is your choice whether to receive Him and welcome Him into your heart and mind The conditions on which we can receive that supernal blessing are made clear in the words that are spoken every week but perhaps do not always sink into our hearts and minds To have the Spirit sent to us we must always remember the Savior and keep his commandments D C 20 77 This time of year helps us remember the Savior s sacrifice and His rising from the tomb a resurrected being Many of us hold images of those scenes in our memories I once stood with my wife outside a tomb in Jerusalem Many believe that it was the tomb from which the crucified Savior emerged as a resurrected and living God The respectful guide that day motioned with his hand and said to us Come see an empty tomb We stooped to enter We saw a stone bench against a wall But into my mind came another picture as real as what we saw that day It was of Mary who was left by the Apostles at the tomb That is what the Spirit let me see and even hear in my mind as clearly as if I had been there But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre And seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain And they say unto her Woman why weepest thou She saith unto them Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him And when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus Jesus saith unto her Woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou She supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him Sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away Jesus saith unto her Mary She turned herself and saith unto him Rabboni which is to say Master Jesus saith unto her Touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my Father but go to my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my Father and your Father and to my God and your God John 20 11 17 I have prayed to be allowed to feel something of what Mary felt at the tomb and what two other disciples felt on the road to Emmaus as they walked with the resurrected Savior thinking Him a visitor to Jerusalem But they constrained him saying Abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent And he went in to tarry with them And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them And their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight And they said one to another Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures Luke 24 29 32 Some of those words were repeated in a sacrament meeting I attended more than 70 years ago In those days sacrament meetings were held in the evening It was dark outside The congregation sang these familiar words I had heard them many times But my lasting memory is of a feeling on one particular night It draws me closer to the Savior Perhaps if I recite the words it will come to all of us again Abide with me tis eventide The day is past and gone The shadows of the evening fall The night is coming on Within my heart a welcome guest Within my home abide Abide with me tis eventide Thy walk today with meHas made my heart within me burn As I communed with thee Thy earnest words have filled my soulAnd kept me near thy side O Savior stay this night with me Behold tis eventide O Savior stay this night with me Behold tis eventide 1More precious than a memory of events is the memory of the Holy Ghost touching our hearts and His continuing affirmation of truth More precious than seeing with our eyes or remembering words spoken and read is recalling the feelings that accompanied the quiet voice of the Spirit Rarely I have felt it exactly as the travelers on the road to Emmaus did as a soft but unmistakable burning in the heart More often it is a feeling of light and quiet assurance We have the priceless promise of the Holy Ghost as a companion and we also have true directions on how to claim that gift These words are said by the Lord s authorized servant with his hands on our head Receive the Holy Ghost At that moment you and I have the assurance He will be sent But our obligation is to choose to open our hearts to receive the ministration of the Spirit over a lifetime The experiences of the Prophet Joseph Smith offer a guide He began and continued his ministry with the decision that his own wisdom was not sufficient to know what course he should pursue He chose to be humble before God Next Joseph chose to ask of God He prayed in faith that God would answer The answer came when he was a young boy Those messages came when he needed to know how God would have His Church established The Holy Ghost comforted and guided him throughout his life He obeyed inspiration when it was difficult For instance he received direction to send the Twelve to England when he needed them most He sent them He accepted correction and comfort from the Spirit when he was imprisoned and the Saints were terribly oppressed And he obeyed when he went down the road to Carthage even as he knew he faced mortal danger The Prophet Joseph set an example for us of how to receive continual spiritual direction and comfort through the Holy Ghost The first choice he made was to be humble before God The second was to pray with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ The third was to obey exactly Obedience may mean to move quickly It may mean to prepare Or it may mean to wait in patience for further inspiration And the fourth is to pray to know the needs and hearts of others and how to help them for the Lord Joseph prayed for the Saints in distress when he was in prison It has been my opportunity to observe the prophets of God as they pray ask for inspiration receive direction and act on it I have seen how often their prayers are about the people they love and serve Their concern for others seems to open their hearts to receive inspiration That can be true for you Inspiration will help us minister to others for the Lord You have seen that in your experience as I have My bishop once said to me at a time when my wife was under great strain in her own life Every time I hear of someone in the ward who needs help when I get there to help I find that your wife was there ahead of me How does she do that She is like all who are great ministers in the Lord s kingdom It seems there are two things they do Great ministers have qualified for the Holy Ghost as a nearly constant companion And they have qualified for the gift of charity which is the pure love of Christ Those gifts have grown in them as they have used them in serving out of love for the Lord The way in which prayer inspiration and love of the Lord work together in our service is described for me perfectly in these words If ye shall ask any thing in my name I will do it If ye love me keep my commandments And I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever Even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father and ye in me and I in you He that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him John 14 14 21 I bear my personal witness that the Father is at this moment aware of you your feelings and the spiritual and temporal needs of everyone around you I bear testimony that the Father and the Son are sending the Holy Ghost to all who have that gift ask for that blessing and seek to be worthy of it Neither the Father nor the Son nor the Holy Ghost force Themselves into our lives We are free to choose The Lord has said to all Behold I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father in his throne He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith Revelation 3 20 22 I pray with all my heart that you will hear the voice of the Spirit which is sent to you so generously And I pray that you will open your heart always to receive Him If you ask with real intent and with faith in Jesus Christ for inspiration you will receive it in the Lord s way and in His time God did that for the young Joseph Smith He does it today for our living prophet President Russell M Nelson He has placed you in the way of other children of God to serve them for Him I know that not only by what I have seen with my eyes but more powerfully by what the Spirit has whispered to my heart I have felt the love of the Father and of His Beloved Son for all the children of God in the world and for His children in the spirit world I have felt the comfort and the direction of the Holy Ghost I pray that you may have the joy of having the Spirit with you as your companion constantly In the name of Jesus Christ amen

My dear brethren who hold the priesthood of God tonight I wish to speak about the wonderful way in which the Lord leads His kingdom on earth You already know the fundamentals I pray that the Holy Ghost will confirm them to you First Jesus Christ is the head of the Church in all the earth Second He leads His Church today by speaking to men called as prophets and He does it through revelation Third He gave revelation to His prophets long ago still does and will continue to do so Fourth He gives confirming revelation to those who serve under the leadership of His prophets From those fundamentals we recognize that the Lord s leadership of His Church requires great and steady faith from all who serve Him on earth For instance it takes faith to believe that the resurrected Lord is watching over the daily details of His kingdom It takes faith to believe that He calls imperfect people into positions of trust It takes faith to believe that He knows the people He calls perfectly both their capacities and their potential and so makes no mistakes in His calls That may bring a smile or a shake of the head to some in this audience both those who think their own call to serve might have been a mistake as well as those who picture some they know who seem poorly suited to their place in the Lord s kingdom My counsel to both groups is to delay such judgments until you can better see what the Lord sees The judgment you need to make instead is that you have the capacity to receive revelation and to act on it fearlessly It takes faith to do so It takes even greater faith to believe that the Lord has called imperfect human servants to lead you My purpose tonight is to build your faith that God directs you in your service to Him And even more importantly my hope is to build your faith that the Lord is inspiring the imperfect persons He has called as your leaders You may think at first that such faith is not important to the success of the Lord s Church and kingdom However you may discover no matter where you are in the chain of priesthood service from the Lord s prophet to a new Aaronic Priesthood holder that faith is essential Let s start with what faith means for a teachers or a deacons quorum president It is important for him to have faith that the Lord called him personally knowing that teacher s weaknesses and strengths He has to have faith that the man who issued the call received revelation by the Spirit of God His counselors and members of his quorum need the same faith to follow him with fearless confidence I saw such confidence when a boy sat with his deacons quorum presidency one Sunday morning He was their newly called secretary That young presidency counseled together They talked about several ways they could fulfill the bishop s request to bring a less active boy back to church After prayer and discussion they appointed the secretary to go to the home of a boy who had never come to a meeting and to invite him The secretary didn t know the boy but he knew that one of the boy s parents was less active and the other was not a member and not friendly The secretary felt anxiety but not fear He knew that the prophet of God had asked priesthood holders to bring back the lost sheep And he had heard the prayer of his presidency He heard them come to agreement on the name of the boy to be rescued and on his own name I was watching when the secretary walked up the street toward the less active boy s house He walked slowly as if he were going into great danger But within a half hour he came back down the road with the boy smiling happily I m not sure he knew it then but he had gone with faith that he was on the Lord s errand That faith has stayed with him and has grown over his years as a missionary a father a leader of young men and a bishop Let s talk about what such faith means for a bishop A bishop is sometimes called to serve people who know him well Ward members know something of his human weaknesses and his spiritual strengths and they know that others in the ward could have been called others who seem better educated more seasoned more pleasant or even better looking These members have to know the call to serve as a bishop came from the Lord by revelation Without their faith the bishop who was called of God will find it harder to get the revelation he needs to help them He will not succeed without the faith of the members to sustain him Happily the reverse is also true Think of the Lord s servant King Benjamin who led his people to repentance The people s hearts were softened by their faith that he was called of God despite his human weaknesses and that his words came from God You remember what the people said Yea we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us we know of their surety and truth because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent which has wrought a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually Mosiah 5 2 For a leader to succeed in the Lord s work the people s trust that he is called of God must override their view of his infirmities and mortal weaknesses You remember how King Benjamin explained his own leadership role I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man But I am like as yourselves subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind yet I have been chosen by this people and consecrated by my father and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power to serve you with all the might mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me Mosiah 2 10 11 Your leader in the Lord s Church may seem to you weak and human or may appear to you strong and inspired The fact is that every leader is a mixture of those traits and more What helps servants of the Lord who are called to lead us is when we can see them as the Lord did when He called them The Lord sees His servants perfectly He sees their potential and their future And He knows how their very nature can be changed He also knows how they can be changed by their experiences with the people they will lead You may have had the experience of being made stronger by the people you were called to serve I was once called as a bishop of young single adults I am not sure whether the Lord s purposes were more for what changes I could help Him make in them or the changes He knew they would make in me To a degree I do not understand most of those young people in that ward acted as if I was called of God especially for them They saw my weaknesses but looked past them I remember one young man who asked for counsel about his educational choices He was a freshman at a very good university A week after I had given the advice he scheduled an appointment with me When he came into the office he surprised me by asking Bishop could we pray before we talk And could we kneel And may I pray His requests surprised me But his prayer surprised me even more It went something like this Heavenly Father You know that Bishop Eyring gave me advice last week and it didn t work Please inspire him to know what I am to do now Now you might smile at that but I didn t He already knew what the Lord wanted him to do But he honored the office of a bishop in the Lord s Church and perhaps wanted me to have the chance to gain greater confidence to receive revelation in that calling It worked As soon as we stood up and then sat down the revelation came to me I told him what I felt the Lord would have him do He was only 18 years old then but he was mature in spiritual years He already knew he didn t need to go to a bishop on such a problem But he had learned to sustain the Lord s servant even in his mortal weaknesses He eventually became a stake president He carried with him the lesson we learned together if you have faith that the Lord leads His Church through revelation to those imperfect servants He calls the Lord will open the windows of heaven to them as He will to you From that experience I carried away the lesson that the faith of the people we serve sometimes more than our own faith brings us revelation in the Lord s service There was another lesson for me If that boy had judged me for my failure to give him good advice the first time he never would have come back to ask again And so by choosing not to judge me he received the confirmation he desired Yet another lesson from that experience has served me well As far as I know he never told anyone in the ward that I had not given good counsel at first Had he done that it might have reduced the faith of others in the ward to trust the bishop s inspiration I try not to judge servants of the Lord or to speak of their apparent weaknesses And I try to teach that by example to my children President James E Faust shared a credo that I am trying to make my own I commend it to you We need to support and sustain our local leaders because they have been called and chosen Every member of this Church may receive counsel from a bishop or a branch president a stake or a mission president and the President of the Church and his associates None of these brethren asked for his calling None is perfect Yet they are the servants of the Lord called by Him through those entitled to inspiration Those called sustained and set apart are entitled to our sustaining support Disrespect for ecclesiastical leaders has caused many to suffer spiritual weakening and downfall We should look past any perceived imperfections warts or spots of the men called to preside over us and uphold the office which they hold Called and Chosen Ensign or Liahona Nov 2005 54 55 That counsel blesses servants of God under all conditions In the early days of the Lord s Church leaders close to the Prophet Joseph Smith began to speak of his faults Even with all they had seen and knew of his standing with the Lord their spirit of criticism and jealousy spread like a plague One of the Twelve set for us all the standard of faith and loyalty we must have if we are to serve in the Lord s kingdom Here is the report Several elders called a meeting in the temple for all those who considered Joseph Smith to be a fallen Prophet They intended to appoint David Whitmer as the new Church leader After listening to the arguments against the Prophet Brigham Young arose and testified Joseph was a Prophet and I knew it and that they might rail and slander him as much as they pleased they could not destroy the appointment of the Prophet of God they could only destroy their own authority cut the thread that bound them to the Prophet and to God and sink themselves to hell Church History in the Fulness of Times Student Manual Church Educational System manual 2003 2nd ed 174 see also Teachings of Presidents of the Church Brigham Young 1997 79 There is a thread that binds us to the Lord in our service It runs from wherever we are called to serve in the kingdom up through those called to preside over us in the priesthood and to the prophet who is bound to the Lord It takes faith and humility to serve in the place to which we are called to trust that the Lord called us and those who preside over us and to sustain them with full faith There will be times as there were in the days of Kirtland when we will need the faith and the integrity of a Brigham Young to stand in the place the Lord has called us to loyal to His prophet and to the leaders He has put in place I bear you my solemn and yet joyful witness that the Lord Jesus Christ is at the helm He leads His Church and His servants I bear witness that Thomas S Monson is the only man who holds and exercises all the keys of the holy priesthood on earth at this time And I pray blessings on all the humble servants who serve so willingly and well in the restored Church of Jesus Christ which He leads personally I testify that Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ They spoke to him The keys of the priesthood were restored for the blessing of all of Heavenly Father s children It is our mission and our trust to serve in our place in the Lord s cause In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters I pray humbly that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us as I speak today My heart is full of gratitude to the Lord whose Church this is for the inspiration we have felt in fervent prayers inspired sermons and angelic singing in this conference Last April President Thomas S Monson gave a message that stirred hearts across the world including mine He spoke of the power of the Book of Mormon He urged us to study ponder and apply its teachings He promised that if we dedicated time each day to studying and pondering and kept the commandments the Book of Mormon contains we would have a vital testimony of its truth and the resultant testimony of the living Christ would see us through to safety in times of trouble See The Power of the Book of Mormon Ensign or Liahona May 2017 86 87 Like many of you I heard the prophet s words as the voice of the Lord to me And also like many of you I decided to obey those words Now since I was a young boy I have felt the witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God that the Father and the Son appeared and spoke with Joseph Smith and that ancient Apostles came to the Prophet Joseph to restore priesthood keys to the Lord s Church With that testimony I have read the Book of Mormon every day for more than 50 years So perhaps I could have reasonably thought that President Monson s words were for someone else Yet like many of you I felt the prophet s encouragement and his promise invite me to make a greater effort Many of you have done what I did prayed with increased intent pondered scripture more intently and tried harder to serve the Lord and others for Him The happy result for me and for many of you has been what the prophet promised Those of us who took his inspired counsel to heart have heard the Spirit more distinctly We have found a greater power to resist temptation and have felt greater faith in a resurrected Jesus Christ in His gospel and in His living Church In a season of increasing tumult in the world those increases in testimony have driven out doubt and fear and have brought us feelings of peace Heeding President Monson s counsel has had two other wonderful effects on me First the Spirit he promised has produced a sense of optimism about what lies ahead even as the commotion in the world seems to increase And second the Lord has given me and you an even greater feeling of His love for those in distress We have felt an increase in the desire to go to the rescue of others That desire has been at the heart of President Monson s ministry and teaching The Lord promised love for others and courage to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery when the tasks ahead of them could have seemed overwhelming The Lord said that needed courage would come from their faith in Him as their rock Fear not to do good my sons for whatsoever ye sow that shall ye also reap therefore if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward Therefore fear not little flock do good let earth and hell combine against you for if ye are built upon my rock they cannot prevail Behold I do not condemn you go your ways and sin no more perform with soberness the work which I have commanded you Look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not Behold the wounds which pierced my side and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet be faithful keep my commandments and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven D C 6 33 37 The Lord told His leaders of the Restoration and He tells us that when we stand with faith upon His rock doubt and fear are diminished the desire to do good increases As we accept President Monson s invitation to plant in our hearts a testimony of Jesus Christ we gain the power the desire and the courage to go to the rescue of others without concern for our own needs I have seen that faith and courage many times when believing Latter day Saints have faced fearsome trials For one example I was in Idaho when the Teton Dam broke on June 5 1976 A wall of water came down Thousands fled from their homes Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed Miraculously fewer than 15 people were killed What I saw there I have seen whenever Latter day Saints stand firmly on the rock of a testimony of Jesus Christ Because they have no doubt He watches over them they become fearless They ignore their own trials to go to the relief of others And they do so out of love for the Lord asking no recompense For example when the Teton Dam broke a Latter day Saint couple was traveling miles away from their home As soon as they heard the news on the radio they hurried back to Rexburg Rather than going to their own home to see if it was destroyed they went looking for their bishop He was in a building that was being used as the recovery center He was helping to direct the thousands of volunteers who were arriving in yellow school buses The couple walked up to the bishop and said We just got back Bishop where can we go to help He gave them the names of a family That couple stayed mucking out mud and water in one home after another They worked from dawn to dark for days They finally took a break to go see about their own home It was gone in the flood leaving nothing to clean up So they turned around quickly to go back to their bishop They asked Bishop do you have someone for us to help That miracle of quiet courage and charity the pure love of Christ has been repeated over the years and across the world It happened in the terrible days of the persecutions and trials at the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith in Missouri It happened as Brigham Young led the exodus from Nauvoo and then called Saints to desert places all over the western United States to help each other create Zion for the Lord If you read the journal entries of those pioneers you see the miracle of faith driving out doubt and fear And you read of Saints leaving their own interests to help someone else for the Lord before getting back to their own sheep or to their own unplowed fields I saw that same miracle a few short days ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Puerto Rico Saint Thomas and Florida where Latter day Saints partnered with other churches local community groups and national organizations to begin cleanup efforts Like my friends in Rexburg one nonmember couple in Florida focused on helping the community rather than laboring on their own property When some Latter day Saint neighbors offered help with the two large trees blocking their driveway the couple explained that they had been overwhelmed and so had turned to helping others having faith that the Lord would provide the aid they needed at their own home The husband then shared that before our Church members arrived with offers of assistance the couple had been praying They had received an answer that help would come It came within hours of that assurance I have heard a report that some have started calling the Latter day Saints who are wearing yellow Helping Hands T shirts The Yellow Angels One Latter day Saint took her car in for service and the man helping her described the spiritual experience he had when people in yellow shirts removed trees from his yard and then he said they sang some song to me about being a child of God Another Florida resident also not of our faith related that Latter day Saints came to her home when she was working in her devastated yard and feeling overwhelmed overheated and close to tears The volunteers created in her words a pure miracle They served not only with diligence but also with laughter and smiles accepting nothing in return I saw that diligence and heard that laughter when late on a Saturday I visited with a group of Latter day Saints in Florida The volunteers stopped their cleanup labor long enough to let me shake some hands They said that 90 members of their stake in Georgia had created a plan to join in the rescue in Florida just the night before They left Georgia at 4 00 in the morning drove for hours worked through the day and into the night and planned to labor again the next day They described it to me all with smiles and good humor The only stress I sensed was that they wanted to stop being thanked so they could get back to work The stake president had restarted his chain saw and was working on a downed tree and a bishop was moving tree limbs as we got into our vehicle to go to the next rescue team Earlier that day as we pulled away from another site a man had walked up to the car taken off his hat and thanked us for the volunteers He said I m not a member of your church I can t believe what you have done for us God bless you The LDS volunteer standing next to him in his yellow shirt smiled and shrugged his shoulders as if he deserved no praise While the volunteers from Georgia had come to help this man who couldn t believe it hundreds of Latter day Saints from that very devastated part of Florida had gone hundreds of miles south to another place in Florida where they had heard the people were harder hit That day I remembered and understood better the prophetic words of the Prophet Joseph Smith A man filled with the love of God is not content with blessing his family alone but ranges through the whole world anxious to bless the whole human race Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 426 We see such love in the lives of Latter day Saints everywhere Each time there is a tragic event anywhere in the world Latter day Saints donate and volunteer to the Church s humanitarian efforts An appeal is seldom needed In fact on some occasions we have had to ask would be volunteers to wait to travel to the recovery site until those directing the work are prepared to receive them That desire to bless is the fruit of people gaining a testimony of Jesus Christ His gospel His restored Church and His prophet That is why the Lord s people doubt not and fear not That is why missionaries volunteer for service in every corner of the world That is why parents pray with their children for others That is why leaders challenge their youth to take President Monson s request to immerse themselves in the Book of Mormon to heart The fruit comes not by being urged by leaders but by the youth and members acting on faith That faith put into action which requires selfless sacrifice brings the change of heart that allows them to feel the love of God Our hearts however remain changed only as long as we continue to follow the prophet s counsel If we stop trying after one burst of effort the change will fade Faithful Latter day Saints have increased their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ in the Book of Mormon as the word of God and in the restoration of priesthood keys in His true Church That increased testimony has given us greater courage and concern for others of God s children But the challenges and the opportunities ahead will require even more We cannot foresee the details but we know the larger picture We know that in the last days the world will be in commotion We know that in the midst of whatever trouble comes the Lord will lead faithful Latter day Saints to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation kindred tongue and people And we know that the Lord s true disciples will be worthy and prepared to receive Him when He comes again We need not fear So as much as we have already built faith and courage in our hearts the Lord expects more from us and from the generations after us They will need to be stronger and braver because they will do even greater and harder things than we have done And they will face increasing opposition from the enemy of our souls The way to optimism as we go forward was given by the Lord Look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not D C 6 36 President Monson told us how to do that We are to ponder and apply the Book of Mormon and the words of prophets Pray always Be believing Serve the Lord with all our heart might mind and strength We are to pray with all the energy of our hearts for the gift of charity the pure love of Christ see Moroni 7 47 48 And above all we are to be consistent and persistent in following prophetic counsel When the way is difficult we can rely on the Lord s promise the promise President Monson has reminded us of when he has often quoted these words of the Savior Whoso receiveth you there I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up D C 84 88 I testify that the Lord goes before your face whenever you are on His errand Sometimes you will be the angel the Lord sends to bear others up Sometimes you will be the one surrounded by angels who bear you up But always you will have His Spirit to be in your heart as you have been promised in every sacrament service You have only to keep His commandments The best days are ahead for the kingdom of God on the earth Opposition will strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ as it has since the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith Faith always defeats fear Standing together produces unity And your prayers for those in need are heard and answered by a loving God He neither slumbers nor does He sleep I bear my witness that God the Father lives and wants you to come home to Him This is the true Church of the Lord Jesus Christ He knows you He loves you He watches over you He atoned for your sins and mine and the sins of all of Heavenly Father s children Following Him in your life and in your service to others is the only way to eternal life I so testify and leave you my blessing and my love In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear sisters we have been blessed by the Spirit of God tonight The inspired messages from the powerful sister leaders and the music have fortified our faith and increased our desire to keep the sacred covenants we have made with our loving Heavenly Father We have felt an increase in our love for the Lord Jesus Christ and an appreciation for the marvelous gift of His atoning sacrifice My message tonight is a simple one We have all felt peace tonight All of us would like to feel such peace often within ourselves in our families and with the people around us The Lord promised peace to His disciples as He was about to leave them He has made the same promise to us But He said that He would give peace in His way not in the world s way He described His way of sending peace But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid John 14 26 27 The sons of Mosiah needed that gift of peace as they embarked on their mission to the Lamanites With more than a little anxiety as they sensed the greatness of their task they prayed for reassurance And the Lord did visit them with his Spirit and said unto them Be comforted And they were comforted Alma 17 10 see also Alma 26 27 At times you may long for peace as you face uncertainty and what seem to you to be looming challenges The sons of Mosiah learned the lesson that the Lord taught to Moroni It is a guide for us all If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness I give unto men weakness that they may be humble and my grace is sufficient for all who humble themselves before me for if they humble themselves before me and have faith in me then will I make weak things become strong unto them Ether 12 27 Moroni said that when he heard these words he was comforted Ether 12 29 They can be a comfort to all of us Those who do not see their weaknesses do not progress Your awareness of your weakness is a blessing as it helps you remain humble and keeps you turning to the Savior The Spirit not only comforts you but He is also the agent by which the Atonement works a change in your very nature Then weak things become strong You will at times have your faith challenged by Satan it happens to all disciples of Jesus Christ Your defense against these attacks is to keep the Holy Ghost as your companion The Spirit will speak peace to your soul He will urge you forward in faith And He will bring back the memory of those times when you felt the light and the love of Jesus Christ Remembering may be one of the most precious gifts the Spirit can give you He will bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever the Lord has said unto you John 14 26 The memory may be of an answered prayer of a priesthood ordinance received of a confirmation of your testimony or of a moment when you saw God s guiding hand in your life Perhaps in a future day when you need strength the Spirit may bring to your memory the feelings you are having during this meeting I pray that this may be so One memory that the Spirit often brings to my mind is of an evening sacrament meeting held many years ago in a metal shed in Innsbruck Austria The shed was under a railroad track There were only about a dozen people present sitting on wooden chairs Most of them were women some younger and some older I saw tears of gratitude as the sacrament was passed among the small congregation I felt the love of the Savior for those Saints and so did they But the miracle I remember most clearly was the light that seemed to fill that metal shed bringing with it a feeling of peace It was nighttime and there were no windows and yet the room was lit as if by noonday sunshine The light of the Holy Spirit was bright and abundant that evening And the windows that let in the light were the humble hearts of those Saints who had come before the Lord seeking forgiveness of their sins and committing to always remember Him It was not hard to remember Him then and my memory of that sacred experience has made it easier for me to remember Him and His Atonement in the years that have followed That day the promise in the sacrament prayer that the Spirit will be with us was fulfilled and so brought feelings of light and peace Like you I have been thankful for the many ways the Lord has visited me with the Comforter when I needed peace Yet our Father in Heaven is concerned not just about our comfort but even more about our upward progress Comforter is only one of the ways the Holy Ghost is described in the scriptures Here is another And now verily verily I say unto thee put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good D C 11 12 Most often the good He will lead you to do will involve helping someone else receive comfort from God In His wisdom the Lord has brought you together in organizations and classes in His Church He has done so to increase your power to do good Within these organizations you have specific charges to serve others for Him For example if you are a young woman you might be asked by your bishop or your Young Women leader to reach out to a Laurel who has become what we sometimes call less active You may know her better than does the bishop or the Young Women leader You may know that she is feeling troubled at home or at school or perhaps both Your leaders may not know why they felt impressed to ask you to reach out to her but the Lord does and He directs this work through the inspiration of His Spirit Success in your efforts will take a miracle of change both in your heart and in the heart of the young woman you were sent to rescue and that requires the companionship of the Holy Ghost The Spirit can allow you to see the less active Laurel as the Lord sees her The Lord knows her heart and your heart and He knows the possibilities of hearts being changed He can visit you both with His Spirit to inspire humility forgiveness and love That Spirit can inspire the words the deeds and the patience necessary for you to invite a lamb back to the flock And He can touch the hearts of the flock in the Laurel class to love and welcome the lost sheep so that when she returns she will feel she has come home Your power to do good as a group of God s daughters will depend to a great degree on the unity and love that exist among you This is another gift of peace that comes through the Holy Ghost Alma understood this That is why he pleaded with his people that there should be no contention one with another but that they should look forward with one eye having one faith and one baptism having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another Mosiah 18 21 Unity is necessary for us to have the Spirit in our class and in our family But you know from experience as I do that such loving unity is hard to maintain It takes having the Holy Ghost as a companion to open our eyes and temper our feelings I remember once a seven or eight year old son of ours jumping on his bed hard enough that I thought it might break I felt a flash of frustration and I moved quickly to set my house in order I grabbed my son by his little shoulders and lifted him up to where our eyes met The Spirit put words into my mind It seemed a quiet voice but it pierced to my heart You are holding a great person I gently set him back on the bed and apologized Now he has become the great man the Holy Ghost let me see 40 years ago I am eternally grateful that the Lord rescued me from my unkind feelings by sending the Holy Ghost to let me see a child of God as He saw him The unity we seek in our families and in the Church will come as we allow the Holy Ghost to affect what we see when we look at one another and even when we think of each other The Spirit sees with the pure love of Christ Listen to the words Mormon used to describe charity Think of times you have felt it Charity suffereth long and is kind and envieth not and is not puffed up seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things Wherefore my beloved brethren and I add sisters if ye have not charity ye are nothing for charity never faileth Wherefore cleave unto charity which is the greatest of all for all things must fail But charity is the pure love of Christ and it endureth forever and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day it shall be well with him Wherefore my beloved brethren and sisters pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons and daughters of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure Moroni 7 45 48 This is the goal that your Father in Heaven has for you His precious daughters It may seem to you like a distant goal but from His perspective you re not that far away So He visits you with His Spirit to comfort you encourage you and inspire you to keep going I leave you my sure witness that the Father knows you knows your needs and your name loves you and hears your prayers His Beloved Son is inviting you to come unto Him And They send the Holy Ghost to attend you in your efforts to serve others for Them Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost will have a sanctifying and purifying effect on your spirit You will then feel the peace the Savior promised to leave with His disciples With that peace will come a bright hope and a feeling of light and love from the Father and His Beloved Son who leads His kingdom on earth through revelation to His living prophet I so testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters I rejoice at the opportunity to be with you at the beginning of this session of general conference I welcome you most warmly General conference has always been a time of gathering for the Latter day Saints We have long since outgrown the ability to gather physically in one place but the Lord has provided ways for the blessings of general conference to reach out to you no matter where you are While it is impressive to see the gathering of Saints in this large Conference Center we who stand at this pulpit always have in our mind s eye the millions of people who are gathered with us around the world to watch and listen to the conference Many of you are gathered with your families some may be gathered with friends or fellow Church members Wherever you are and however you are hearing my voice please know that even though you are not with us in person we feel that you are with us in spirit We hope all of you will feel one with us that you will feel the spiritual power that comes whenever a body of believers gathers in the name of Jesus Christ I have felt impressed to speak to you today about another kind of gathering This kind does not happen only every six months as general conference does Instead it has been going on continuously since the early days of the Restoration of the Church and it has been hastening in recent years I refer to the gathering of the family of God To describe this gathering it may be best to begin before we were born before what the Bible calls the beginning Genesis 1 1 At that time we lived with Heavenly Father as His spirit children This is true of every person who has ever lived on earth You see the names brother and sister are not just friendly greetings or terms of endearment for us They are an expression of an eternal truth God is the literal Father of all mankind we are each part of His eternal family Because He loves us with the love of a perfect Father He wants us to progress and advance and become like Him He ordained a plan by which we would come to earth in families and have experiences that would prepare us to return to Him and live as He lives The central element of this plan was the promise that Jesus Christ would offer Himself as a sacrifice to rescue us from sin and death Our task in that plan is to accept the Savior s sacrifice by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel You and I accepted this plan In fact we rejoiced in it even though it would mean that we would leave the presence of our Father and forget what we had experienced there with Him But we were not sent here completely in the dark Each of us was given a portion of God s light called the Light of Christ to help us distinguish between good and evil right and wrong This is why even those who live with little or no knowledge of the Father s plan can still sense in their hearts that certain actions are just and moral while others are not Our sense of right and wrong seems especially keen when we are raising our children Innate in almost every parent is the desire to teach his or her children moral virtues This is part of the miracle of Heavenly Father s plan He wants His children to come to earth following the eternal pattern of families that exists in heaven Families are the basic organizational unit of the eternal realms and so He intends for them also to be the basic unit on earth Though earthly families are far from perfect they give God s children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heaven parental love Families are also the best way to preserve and pass on moral virtues and true principles that are most likely to lead us back to God s presence Only a very small minority of God s children obtain during this life a complete understanding of God s plan along with access to the priesthood ordinances and covenants that make the Savior s atoning power fully operative in our lives Even those with the best of parents may live faithfully according to the light they have but never hear about Jesus Christ and His Atonement or be invited to be baptized in His name This has been true for countless millions of our brothers and sisters throughout the world s history Some may consider this unfair They may even take it as evidence that there is no plan no specific requirements for salvation feeling that a just loving God would not create a plan that is available to such a small proportion of His children Others might conclude that God must have determined in advance which of His children He would save and made the gospel available to them while those who never heard the gospel simply were not chosen But you and I know because of the truths restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith that God s plan is much more loving and just than that Our Heavenly Father is anxious to gather and bless all of His family While He knows that not all of them will choose to be gathered His plan gives each of His children the opportunity to accept or reject His invitation And families are at the heart of this plan Centuries ago the prophet Malachi said that in a coming day God would send Elijah to turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers Malachi 4 6 This prophecy was so important the Savior quoted it when He visited the Americas after His Resurrection see 3 Nephi 25 5 6 And when the angel Moroni visited the Prophet Joseph Smith he too quoted the prophecy about Elijah and hearts fathers and children see Joseph Smith History 1 36 39 Today is April 1 Two days from now April 3 marks 181 years from the day when Malachi s prophecy was fulfilled On that day Elijah did come and he gave to Joseph Smith the priesthood power to seal families eternally see D C 110 13 16 From that day to this interest in exploring one s family history has grown exponentially At ever increasing rates people seem drawn to their ancestry with more than just casual curiosity Genealogical libraries associations and technologies have emerged around the world to support this interest The internet s power to enhance communications has enabled families to work together to do family history research with a speed and thoroughness never before possible Why is all of this happening For lack of a better term we call it the spirit of Elijah We could also equally call it fulfillment of prophecy I bear testimony that Elijah did come The hearts of the children of you and me have turned to our fathers our ancestors The affection you feel for your ancestors is part of the fulfillment of that prophecy It is deeply seated in your sense of who you are But it has to do with more than just inherited DNA For example as you follow the promptings to learn about your family history you may discover that a distant relative shares some of your facial features or your interest in books or your talent for singing This could be very interesting and even insightful But if your work stops there you will sense that something is missing This is because to gather and unite God s family requires more than just warm feelings It requires sacred covenants made in connection with priesthood ordinances Many of your ancestors did not receive those ordinances But in the providence of God you did And God knew that you would feel drawn to your ancestors in love and that you would have the technology necessary to identify them He also knew that you would live in a time when access to holy temples where the ordinances can be performed would be greater than ever in history And He knew that He could trust you to accomplish this work in behalf of your ancestors Of course all of us have many pressing and important responsibilities that need our attention and time All of us find parts of what the Lord expects us to do beyond our abilities Fortunately the Lord provides a way for each of us to gain confidence and satisfaction in all our service including family history service We gain strength to do what He asks through our faith that the Savior gives no commandment save he shall prepare a way for us that we may accomplish the thing which he commandeth 1 Nephi 3 7 I know this is true from experience Many years ago as a university student I met a man who worked for one of the largest computer companies in the world This was in the early days of computing and it just so happened that his company had sent him to sell computers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints As far as I could tell this salesman had no religious faith Yet he said with wonder and exasperation In this church they were doing what they called genealogy searching for names of people who are dead trying to identify their ancestors People mostly women were running around between filing cabinets searching through little cards for information If I remember right he said the ladies were wearing tennis shoes so they could run a little faster The man went on As I saw the magnitude of what they were trying to do I realized that I had discovered the reason for the invention of computers Well he was partially right Computers would be an important part of the future of family history work just not the computers he was selling An inspired leader of the Church chose not to buy his computers The Church was to wait for technology that at that time had not yet even been imagined But I have learned in the many years since that even the best technology can never be a substitute for revelation from heaven like the kind that Church leader received This is a spiritual work and the Lord directs it through His Holy Spirit Just a few weeks ago I was working on my family history with a consultant by my side and another helper on the phone On the computer screen before me was a problem beyond my mortal power to solve I saw two names sent to me by the wonders of technology of people who might be waiting for a temple ordinance But the trouble was that the names were different but there was a reason to believe they might be the same person My task was to determine what was true I asked my consultants to tell me They said No you must choose And they were completely sure I would discover the truth The computer with all its power and information had left me the blessing of staring at those names on a screen evaluating the available information seeking other research praying silently and discovering what was true As I prayed I knew with surety what to do just as I have in other situations when I needed to rely on heaven s help to solve a problem We do not know what marvels God will inspire people to create to help in His work of gathering His family But whatever marvelous inventions may come their use will require the Spirit working in people like you and me This should not surprise us After all these are beloved sons and daughters of God He will send whatever inspiration is needed to give them the opportunity to return to Him In recent years the youth of the Church have responded to the spirit of Elijah in an inspiring way Many now hold their own limited use temple recommend and use it often Temple baptistries are busier than ever some temples have even had to adjust their schedules to accommodate the increase in the number of young people attending the temple It used to be a rare but welcome exception for youth to bring the names of their own ancestors to the temple Now this is the norm and very often it is the young people themselves who found those ancestors In addition many youth have discovered that giving of their time to do family history research and temple work has deepened their testimony of the plan of salvation It has increased the influence of the Spirit in their lives and decreased the influence of the adversary It has helped them feel closer to their families and closer to the Lord Jesus Christ They have learned that this work saves not just the dead it saves all of us see D C 128 18 The youth have caught the vision admirably now their parents need to catch up There are now many people who have accepted baptism in the spirit world because of the work done by the youth and they are waiting for other ordinances that only adults can perform in temples in this world The work of gathering Heavenly Father s family is not just for young people and it is not just for grandparents It is for everyone We are all gatherers This is the work of our generation what the Apostle Paul called the dispensation of the fulness of times when he said God would gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him Ephesians 1 10 This is made possible through the atoning work of God s Beloved Son Jesus Christ Because of Him our family members who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ For he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us Ephesians 2 13 14 You have felt this as I have when you have experienced an increase of love as you looked at the picture of an ancestor You have felt it in the temple when the name on a card seemed like more than a name and you couldn t help but sense that this person was aware of you and felt your love I testify that God the Father wants His children home again in families and in glory The Savior lives He directs and blesses this work and He watches over and guides us He thanks you for your faithful service in gathering His Father s family and I promise you the inspired help that you seek and need In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brethren of the priesthood my purpose today is both to reassure you and to invigorate you in your priesthood service In some ways it is similar to the purpose I imagine the Savior had when He met a rich young man who asked What good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life Matthew 19 16 Perhaps you have come to this conference as this young man went to the Savior wondering whether your service has been acceptable And at the same time you may sense that there is more to do perhaps much more I pray that I may be able to convey the Lord s loving approval for what you have already done while also offering an encouraging glimpse of what you may with His help yet achieve as a holder of His holy priesthood The rich young man was asked to sell everything he had and give to the poor and follow the Savior your future progress may not require that but it will require a measure of sacrifice Either way I hope my message does not cause you to go away sorrowful as the young man did See Matthew 19 20 22 Rather I trust that you will go on your way rejoicing D C 84 105 because you want to improve and you think you can Even so it s natural to feel some inadequacy when we consider what the Lord has called us to do In fact if you told me that you feel perfectly capable of fulfilling your priesthood duties I might worry that you do not understand them On the other hand if you told me that you feel like giving up because the task is too far beyond your abilities then I would want to help you understand how the Lord magnifies and strengthens the holders of His priesthood to do things they never could have done alone This is just as true for me in my calling as it is for you in yours None of us can do the work of the priesthood and do it well relying solely on our own wisdom and talents That is because this is not our work it is the Lord s So the only way to succeed is to rely on Him whether you are a newly called deacon trusted with the task to bring a measure of spiritual power to the ordinance of the sacrament or a young home teacher assigned by the Lord to love and minister to a family you don t know and who seems not to want your love or your ministering or a father who knows you are to preside over your home in righteousness but perhaps you re unsure how to do it and time seems to be running out because those children are growing up quickly and the world seems so harsh and hostile So if you feel a little overwhelmed take that as a good sign It indicates that you can sense the magnitude of the trust God has placed in you It means that you have some small understanding of what the priesthood really is There are very few people in the world who have that understanding Even those who can recite a reasonable definition may not truly understand it There are some scriptures that through the power of the Spirit they carry can deepen our sense of awe regarding the holy priesthood Here are some of those scriptures The power and authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven to have the heavens opened unto them to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant The power and authority of the Aaronic Priesthood is to hold the keys of the ministering of angels D C 107 18 20 In the ordinances of the priesthood the power of godliness is manifest For without this no man can see the face of God even the Father and live D C 84 20 22 This high priesthood is after the order of God s Son which order was from the foundation of the world or in other words being without beginning of days or end of years being prepared from eternity to all eternity according to his foreknowledge of all things Alma 13 7 Every one being ordained after this order and calling should have power by faith to break mountains to divide the seas to dry up waters to turn them out of their course To put at defiance the armies of nations to divide the earth to break every band to stand in the presence of God to do all things according to his will according to his command subdue principalities and powers and this by the will of the Son of God which was from before the foundation of the world Joseph Smith Translation Genesis 14 30 31 in the Bible appendix One way to respond to such awe inspiring descriptions of the power of the priesthood is to assume that they do not apply to us Another way to respond is with soul searching questions asked in our own hearts such as these Have I ever felt that the heavens have been opened to me Would anyone use the phrase ministering of angels to describe my priesthood service Do I bring the power of godliness into the lives of those I serve Have I ever broken a mountain defied an army broken someone s bands or subdued worldly powers even if only figuratively in order to accomplish God s will Such introspection always brings a feeling that we could be doing more in the service of the Lord I hope it also brings you a feeling that you want to do more a longing to participate more fully in the Lord s miraculous work Such feelings are the first step toward becoming the kind of men that priesthood service is meant to produce The next step is described in an interaction between Jehovah and Enoch We know Enoch as a mighty prophet who established Zion in the midst of great wickedness But before he was a mighty prophet Enoch saw himself as but a lad slow of speech and hated by all the people Moses 6 31 Listen to the words the Lord used to encourage Enoch They are also His words to you who are called to minister to others as a priesthood holder And the Lord said unto Enoch Go forth and do as I have commanded thee and no man shall pierce thee Open thy mouth and it shall be filled and I will give thee utterance for all flesh is in my hands and I will do as seemeth me good Behold my Spirit is upon you wherefore all thy words will I justify and the mountains shall flee before you and the rivers shall turn from their course and thou shalt abide in me and I in you therefore walk with me Moses 6 32 34 Brethren our ordination to the priesthood is an invitation from the Lord to walk with Him And what does it mean to walk with the Lord It means to do what He does to serve the way He serves He sacrificed His own comforts to bless those in need so that s what we try to do He seemed to take particular notice of people who were overlooked and even shunned by society so we should try to do that too He testified boldly yet lovingly of the true doctrine He received from His Father even if it was unpopular and so must we He said to all Come unto me Matthew 11 28 and we say to all Come unto Him As priesthood holders we are His representatives We act not for ourselves but for Him We speak not our words but His The people we serve come to know Him better because of our service As soon as we accept the Lord s invitation Walk with me the nature of our priesthood service changes It becomes all at once higher and nobler but also more achievable because we know that we are not alone I felt this most powerfully when President Thomas S Monson laid his hands on my head nine years ago and blessed me as I began my service in my current calling In that blessing he recited these words of the Savior And whoso receiveth you there I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up D C 84 88 I have relied upon that promise many times and I have seen it fulfilled in many ways throughout my 72 years of priesthood service It happened when I was a new Aaronic Priesthood holder with an assignment to pass the sacrament Terrified that I would make a mistake I went outside the chapel before the meeting started and prayed in desperation that God would help me An answer came I felt that the Lord was with me I felt His confidence in me and so I felt confidence in my part in His work It happened again while I was serving as a bishop I received a phone call from a woman who had made a serious mistake and now faced a difficult life changing decision As I visited with her I felt I knew the answer to her problem but I also felt strongly that I should not give her that answer she needed to obtain it for herself My words to her were I believe God will tell you what to do if you would ask Him She later reported that she did ask Him and He did tell her On another occasion a phone call came when I was a bishop this time from the police I was told that a drunk driver had crashed his car through the glass into the lobby of a bank When the bewildered driver saw the security guard with his weapon brandished he cried Don t shoot I m a Mormon The inebriated driver was discovered to be a member of my ward baptized only recently As I waited to speak to him in the bishop s office I planned what I would say to make him feel remorseful for the way he had broken his covenants and embarrassed the Church But as I sat looking at him I heard a voice in my mind say just as clearly as if someone were speaking to me I m going to let you see him as I see him And then for a brief moment his whole appearance changed to me I saw not a dazed young man but a bright noble son of God I suddenly felt the Lord s love for him That vision changed our conversation It also changed me I learned important lessons from these experiences walking with the Lord in doing His work I would like to share with you three of them The first is that God notices and will support even the newest and youngest deacon You need never feel that you are too small or too insignificant for Him to take notice of you and the service you are giving in His name The second lesson is that the Lord s work is not just to solve problems it is to build people So as you walk with Him in priesthood service you may find that sometimes what seems like the most efficient solution is not the Lord s preferred solution because it does not allow people to grow If you listen He will teach you His ways Remember that God s work and glory is not simply to run an effective organization it is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 This is after all why He gives His priesthood authority to flawed mortals like you and me and invites us to participate in His work Our progress is His work Now the third lesson Walking with the Savior in priesthood service will change the way you look at others He will teach you to see them through His eyes which means seeing past an outward appearance and into the heart see 1 Samuel 16 7 This is how the Savior was able to see Simon not as an impulsive fisherman but as Peter the rock solid future leader of His Church see Luke 5 1 11 This is how He was able to see Zacchaeus not as the corrupt tax collector others saw but as an honest upright son of Abraham see Luke 19 1 9 If you walk with the Savior long enough you will learn to see everyone as a child of God with limitless potential regardless of what his or her past may have been And if you continue walking with the Savior you will develop another gift He has the ability to help people see that potential in themselves and so repent My dear brethren of the priesthood in many ways we are like the two disciples who walked the road to Emmaus on that first Easter Sunday It was Resurrection morning but they were not yet sure there was a resurrection or what resurrection even meant They had trusted that Jesus of Nazareth should have redeemed Israel but they were slow of heart to believe everything the scriptures taught about resurrection As they walked along and tried to reason it out together Jesus himself drew near and went with them But their eyes were holden that they should not know him See Luke 24 13 32 I testify that when we walk the path of priesthood service the Savior Jesus Christ goes with us for it is His path His way His light goes before us and His angels are round about us We may lack a full understanding of what the priesthood is or how to exercise it as He does But if we pay close attention to those moments when our hearts burn within us Luke 24 32 our eyes can be opened and we will see His hand in our lives and in our service I testify that we come to know Him best by working with Him and serving Him in the great work of bringing salvation to God s children For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart Mosiah 5 13 Jesus Christ is our Master This is His Church It is His priesthood which we hold May we each choose to walk with Him and to recognize how He walks with us I give you my solemn witness that Jesus is the Christ our resurrected Lord I bear you my testimony that the priesthood He has trusted us with is the power to speak and to act in His name We are children of a loving Heavenly Father who answers our prayers and sends the Holy Ghost to strengthen us in every priesthood responsibility we are blessed to receive Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son He received the keys of the priesthood which have been passed on to President Thomas S Monson who exercises them today I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen

I feel blessed to be in this meeting with those who hold the priesthood of God The devotion the faith and the selfless service of this body of men and boys are a modern miracle I speak tonight to priesthood holders older and younger united in wholehearted service to the Lord Jesus Christ The Lord grants His power to those in all priesthood offices who worthily serve in their priesthood duties Wilford Woodruff as President of the Church described his experience in the offices of the priesthood I heard the first sermon I ever heard in this Church The next day I was baptized I was ordained a Teacher My mission immediately commenced I went through that whole mission as a Teacher At the conference I was ordained a Priest After I was ordained a Priest I was sent on a mission to the southern country That was in the fall of 1834 I had a companion with me and we started out without purse and scrip I traveled alone a good many miles and preached the Gospel and I baptized a number that I could not confirm in the Church because I was only a Priest I traveled some time preaching the Gospel before I was ordained an Elder Now I have been some fifty four years a member of the Twelve Apostles I have traveled with that and other quorums now for sixty years and I want to say to this assembly that I was just as much sustained by the power of God while holding the office of a Teacher and especially while officiating in the vineyard as a Priest as I ever was as an Apostle There is no difference in this so long as we do our duty 1That wonderful spiritual possibility of no difference is suggested in the Lord s description of the Aaronic Priesthood as an appendage of the Melchizedek Priesthood 2 The word appendage means the two are connected This connection is important to the priesthood becoming the force and the blessing it can be in this world and forever for it is without beginning of days or end of years 3The connection is a simple one The Aaronic Priesthood prepares young men for an even more sacred trust The power and authority of the higher or Melchizedek Priesthood is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven to have the heavens opened unto them to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant 4Those priesthood keys are fully exercised by only one man at a time the President and presiding high priest of the Lord s Church Then by the President s delegation every man who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood can be endowed with authority and the privilege of speaking and acting in the name of the Almighty There is infinity to that power It is concerned with life and death with family and the Church with the great nature of God Himself and His eternal work The Lord is preparing the Aaronic Priesthood holder to become an elder serving with faith power and gratitude in that glorious Melchizedek Priesthood For elders deep gratitude will be essential to playing your part in full priesthood service You will remember your days as a deacon teacher or priest when those who held the higher priesthood reached back to lift and encourage you in your priesthood journey Every holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood has such memories but the sense of gratitude may have diminished with the years My hope is to rekindle that feeling and with it a determination to give to all you can the same kind of help you once received I remember a bishop who treated me as if I were already what I had the potential to become in priesthood power He called me one Sunday when I was a priest He said he needed me to be his companion to visit some members of our ward He made it sound as if I were his only hope for success He didn t need me He had excellent counselors in his bishopric We visited a penniless and hungry widow He wanted me to help him reach her heart challenge her to make and use a budget and promise her that she could rise to be in a position not only to take care of herself but also to help others We went next to comfort two little girls living in a difficult situation As we walked away the bishop said quietly to me Those children will never forget that we came to them At the next house I saw how to invite a less active man to come back to the Lord by convincing him the ward members needed him That bishop was a Melchizedek Priesthood holder who was raising my sights and giving me a boost by example He taught me to have the power and the courage to go anywhere in service for the Lord He is long gone to his reward but I still remember him because he reached down to lift me up when I was an inexperienced Aaronic Priesthood holder I learned later that he saw me on a future priesthood path of greater responsibilities then beyond my own vision My father did the same thing for me He was a seasoned and wise holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood Once he was asked by an Apostle to write a short note about the scientific evidence for the age of the earth He wrote it carefully knowing that some who might read it had strong feelings that the earth was much younger than the scientific evidence suggested I still remember my father handing me what he had written and saying to me Hal you have the spiritual wisdom to know if I should send this to the apostles and prophets I can t remember much of what the paper said but I will carry with me forever the gratitude I felt for a great Melchizedek Priesthood holder who saw in me spiritual wisdom that I could not see One night some years later after I had been ordained an Apostle the prophet of God called me and asked me to read something that had been written about Church doctrine He had spent the night reading the chapters of a book He said with a chuckle I can t get through all of this You shouldn t be resting while I m working And then he used almost the same words my father had years before Hal you are the one who should read this You will know if it is right to publish it That same pattern of a Melchizedek Priesthood holder raising sights and giving confidence came one night at a speech festival sponsored by the Church At 17 years of age I was asked to speak to a large audience I had no idea what was expected of me I wasn t given a subject and so I prepared a talk that was way beyond what I knew about the gospel As I spoke I realized I had made a mistake I can still remember that after I spoke I had a sinking feeling of having failed The next and final speaker was Elder Matthew Cowley of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles He was a great orator beloved across the Church I still remember looking up at him from my seat next to the rostrum He began in a powerful voice He said that my speech had made him feel that he was at a great conference He smiled as he said it My feelings of failure left and were followed by confidence that I might someday become what he seemed to think I already was The memory of that night still leads me to listen carefully when an Aaronic Priesthood holder speaks Because of what Elder Cowley did for me I always expect that I will hear the word of God I am seldom disappointed and often amazed and I can t help but smile as Elder Cowley did Many things may help strengthen our younger brothers to rise up in the priesthood but nothing will be more powerful than our helping them develop the faith and confidence that they can draw on the power of God in their priesthood service That faith and confidence won t stay with them from a single experience of being lifted by even the most gifted Melchizedek Priesthood holder The ability to draw on those powers must be cultivated by many expressions of confidence from those who are more experienced in the priesthood The Aaronic Priesthood holders will also need daily and even hourly encouragement and correction from the Lord Himself through the Holy Ghost That will be available to them as they choose to remain worthy of it It will depend upon the choices they will make That is why we must teach by example and by testimony that the words of the great Melchizedek Priesthood leader King Benjamin are true 5 They are words of love spoken in the name of the Lord whose priesthood this is King Benjamin teaches what is required of us to remain pure enough to receive the encouragement and the correction of the Lord And finally I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin for there are divers ways and means even so many that I cannot number them But this much I can tell you that if ye do not watch yourselves and your thoughts and your words and your deeds and observe the commandments of God and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord even unto the end of your lives ye must perish And now O man remember and perish not 6We all are aware of the fiery darts of the enemy of righteousness being sent like a terrible wind against the young priesthood holders we love so much To us they seem like the stripling warriors who called themselves the sons of Helaman They can survive as those young warriors did if they keep themselves safe as King Benjamin urged them to do The sons of Helaman did not doubt They fought bravely and came off conquerors because they believed the words of their mothers 7 We understand the power of the faith of a loving mother Mothers provide that great support to their sons today We holders of the priesthood can and must add to that support with our determination to answer the charge that as we are converted we are to reach down to strengthen our brethren 8My prayer is that every Melchizedek Priesthood holder will accept the opportunity offered by the Lord And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit let him take with him him that is weak that he may be edified in all meekness that he may become strong also Therefore take with you those who are ordained unto the lesser priesthood and send them before you to make appointments and to prepare the way and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill Behold this is the way that mine apostles in ancient days built up my church unto me 9You priesthood leaders and fathers of Aaronic Priesthood holders can work miracles You can help the Lord fill the ranks of faithful elders with young men who accept the call to preach the gospel and do it with confidence You will see many you have lifted and encouraged stay faithful marry worthily in the temple and in turn lift and prepare others It will not take new activity programs improved teaching materials or better social media It will not require any call beyond what you have now The oath and the covenant of the priesthood gives you power authority and direction I pray you will go home and study carefully the oath and covenant of the priesthood found in Doctrine and Covenants section 84 All of us hope that more young men will have experiences like Wilford Woodruff who as an Aaronic Priesthood holder taught the gospel of Jesus Christ with converting power I pray that we will rise to our call to lift others to prepare them for their glorious service I thank with all my heart the wonderful people who have lifted me and shown me how to love and lift others I testify that President Thomas S Monson holds all the keys of the priesthood on earth at this time I bear witness that he over a lifetime of service has been an example for us all of reaching to lift others as a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood I am personally grateful for the way he has lifted me and shown me how to lift others God the Father lives Jesus is the Christ This is His Church and kingdom This is His priesthood I know this for myself by the power of the Holy Ghost In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters who are spread across the world in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I am grateful that President Thomas S Monson has asked me to speak in conference on this Sabbath day I pray that the Holy Ghost will carry my words into your heart Today I desire to speak about feelings of the heart The one I will focus on is gratitude particularly on the Sabbath day We feel grateful for many things a kindness from a stranger a meal when we are hungry a dry roof over our heads when storms arise a broken bone that heals and the hearty cry of a newborn baby Many of us will remember feeling gratitude at such moments For Latter day Saints the Sabbath is such a moment actually a day of gratitude and love The Lord instructed the Saints in Jackson County Missouri in 1831 that their prayers and thanks should be directed heavenward The early Saints were given a revelation about how to keep the Sabbath day and how to fast and pray 1They and we were told by the Lord how to worship and give thanks on the Sabbath As you can tell what matters most is the love we feel for the givers of the gifts Here are the Lord s words of how to give thanks and how to love on the Sabbath I give unto them a commandment saying thus Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy might mind and strength and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit 2And then the Lord goes on to warn of danger should we fail to thank Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as the givers of the gifts And in nothing doth man offend God or against none is his wrath kindled save those who confess not his hand in all things and obey not his commandments 3Many of you listening already find joy in the Sabbath as a day to remember and give thanks to God for blessings You remember the familiar song When upon life s billows you are tempest tossed When you are discouraged thinking all is lost Count your many blessings name them one by one And it will surprise you what the Lord has done Count your blessings Name them one by one Count your blessings See what God hath done Are you ever burdened with a load of care Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear Count your many blessings ev ry doubt will fly And you will be singing as the days go by 4I receive letters and visits from faithful Latter day Saints who feel burdened with a load of care Some are close to feeling that at least for them all is lost I hope and pray that what I say about being grateful on the Sabbath will be helpful to make doubts fly and for singing to start in your hearts One blessing for which we can be grateful is that we are there in that sacrament meeting at all gathered with more than one or two of His disciples in His name There are some at home unable to rise from their beds There are some who would like to be where we are but are instead serving in hospitals and providing public safety or are defending us at the risk of their own lives in some desert or jungle The fact that we are able to gather with even one other Saint and partake of the sacrament will help us begin to feel gratitude and love for God s kindness Because of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the restored gospel another blessing we can count is that we have the opportunity to take the sacrament each week prepared blessed and passed by authorized servants of God We can be grateful when the Holy Spirit confirms to us that the words of the sacrament prayers offered by those authorized priesthood holders are honored by our Heavenly Father Of all the blessings we can count the greatest by far is the feeling of forgiveness that comes as we partake of the sacrament We will feel greater love and appreciation for the Savior whose infinite sacrifice made possible our being cleansed from sin As we partake of the bread and water we remember that He suffered for us And when we feel gratitude for what He has done for us we will feel His love for us and our love for Him The blessing of love we receive will make it easier for us to keep the commandment to always remember him 5 You may even feel love and gratitude as I do for the Holy Ghost who Heavenly Father has promised will always be with us as we remain faithful to the covenants we have made We can count all those blessings every Sunday and feel grateful The Sabbath is also a perfect time to remember the covenant we made at the waters of baptism to love and serve Heavenly Father s children Fulfilling that promise on the Sabbath will include participating in a class or quorum with full purpose of heart to build faith and love among our brothers and sisters who are there with us That promise will include cheerfully fulfilling our callings I am grateful for the many Sundays I taught a deacons quorum in Bountiful Utah as well as a Sunday School class in Idaho And I even remember the times I served as an assistant to my wife in the nursery where my main task was to hand out toys and pick them up It was years before I recognized through the Spirit that my simple service for the Lord mattered in the lives of Heavenly Father s children To my surprise some of them have remembered and thanked me for my fledgling attempts to serve them for the Master on those Sabbath days Just as we sometimes cannot see the results of our own service given on the Sabbath we may not be able to see the cumulative effects of other servants of the Lord But the Lord is building His kingdom quietly through His faithful and humble servants with little fanfare toward its glorious millennial future It takes the Holy Spirit to see the growing grandeur I grew up going to sacrament meetings in a tiny New Jersey branch with only a few members and one family my own Seventy five years ago I was baptized in Philadelphia in the only Church built chapel we could get to in Pennsylvania or New Jersey Yet where there was one little branch in Princeton New Jersey there are now two large wards And just days ago thousands of young people performed in a celebration preceding the dedication of the Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple As a young man I was called as a district missionary where we worshipped on Sundays in the only chapel in Albuquerque New Mexico Today there is a temple and four stakes I left Albuquerque to go to school in Cambridge Massachusetts There was one chapel and a district that stretched across much of Massachusetts and Rhode Island I drove the hills of that beautiful country to sacrament meetings in tiny branches most in small rented facilities or little remodeled homes Now there is a sacred temple of God in Belmont Massachusetts and stakes that spread across the countryside What I could not see clearly then was that the Lord was pouring out His Spirit on people in those little sacrament meetings I could feel it but I could not see the extent and the timing of the Lord s intentions to build and glorify His kingdom A prophet by revelation saw and recorded what we can now see ourselves Nephi said that our total numbers would not be great but that the cumulative light would be a sight to see And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God and its numbers were few And it came to pass that I Nephi beheld the power of the Lamb of God that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb and upon the covenant people of the Lord who were scattered upon all the face of the earth and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory 6In this dispensation a similar prophetic description of our condition and the opportunities ahead is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants Ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you And ye cannot bear all things now nevertheless be of good cheer for I will lead you along The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours and the riches of eternity are yours And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious and the things of this earth shall be added unto him even an hundred fold yea more 7I have felt that transformation of growing gratitude for blessings and a love of God increasing across the Church It seems to accelerate among members of the Church in times and places where there are trials of their faith where they have to plead to God for help to even carry on The times we will pass through will have in them hard trials as they did for the people of Alma under the cruel Amulon who put burdens on their backs too heavy for them to bear And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions saying Lift up your heads and be of good comfort for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders that even you cannot feel them upon your backs even while you are in bondage and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter and that ye may know of a surety that I the Lord God do visit my people in their afflictions And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light yea the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord 8You and I are witnesses that whenever we have kept our covenants with God especially when it was hard He has heard our prayers of thanks for what He has already done for us and has answered our prayer for strength to endure faithfully And more than once He has made us cheerful as well as strong You might well be wondering what you could do to live and worship on this Sabbath day to demonstrate your gratitude and to strengthen yourself and others for trials that lie ahead You could begin today with a private and family prayer of thanks for all God has done for you You could pray to know what the Lord would have you do to serve Him and others Particularly you could pray to have the Holy Ghost tell you of someone who is lonely or in need to whom the Lord would have you go I can promise you your prayers will be answered and as you act on the answers you will receive you will find joy in the Sabbath and your heart will overflow with thankfulness I testify that God the Father knows and loves you The Savior the Lord Jesus Christ atoned for your sins out of love for you They the Father and the Son know your name as They knew the name of the Prophet Joseph Smith when They appeared to him I testify that this is the Church of Jesus Christ and that He will honor the covenants you make and renew with God Your very nature will be changed to become more like the Savior You will be fortified against temptation and against feelings of doubt about the truth You will find joy in the Sabbath I so promise you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be with you this evening in the general priesthood session of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints This is a grand moment in the history of the Church One hundred eighty two years ago in 1834 in Kirtland Ohio all of the priesthood holders were called to meet together in a 14 by 14 foot 4 2 by 4 2 m log schoolhouse In that meeting the Prophet Joseph Smith is reported to have said You know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother s lap You don t comprehend it It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight but this Church will fill North and South America it will fill the world 1Millions of priesthood holders in more than 110 countries are gathered in this session Perhaps the Prophet Joseph foresaw this time and the glorious future yet ahead of us My message tonight is an attempt to describe that future and what we must do to be a part of the plan of happiness our Heavenly Father has prepared for us Before we were born we lived in a family with our exalted and eternal Heavenly Father He ordained a plan that enables us to advance and progress to become like Him He did it out of love for us The purpose of the plan was to allow us the privilege of living forever as our Heavenly Father lives This gospel plan offered us a life of mortality in which we would be tested A promise was given that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ if we obeyed the laws and priesthood ordinances of the gospel we would have eternal life the greatest of all His gifts Eternal life is that kind of life which God our Eternal Father lives God has said that His purpose is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 The great purpose of every priesthood holder therefore is to assist in the work of helping people rise to eternal life Every priesthood effort and every priesthood ordinance is intended to help Heavenly Father s children be changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ to become members of perfected family units It follows that the great work of every man is to believe the gospel to keep the commandments and to create and perfect an eternal family unit 2 and to help others do the same Since that is true everything we do should have celestial marriage as its focus and purpose That means we must strive to be sealed to an eternal companion in the temple of God We must also encourage others to make and keep the covenants that bind a husband and wife together with their family in this life and in the world to come Why should this matter so much to each of us young or old deacon or high priest son or father It is because our priesthood obligation is to put our families and the families of those around us at the center of our concern Every major decision should be based on the effect it will have on a family to qualify for life with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ There is nothing in our priesthood service as important as this Let me tell you what this could mean to a deacon listening tonight as a member of a family unit and as a quorum member In his family there may or may not be regular family prayer or frequent family home evening If his father sensing these obligations calls the family together for prayer or scripture reading the deacon can rush to take part with a smile He can encourage his brothers and sisters to participate and praise them when they do He can ask his father for a blessing when school begins or in another moment of need He may not have such a faithful father But the very desire of his heart for those experiences will bring the powers of heaven to those around him because of his faith They will seek for the family life that deacon wants with all his heart The teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood can see in his home teaching assignment an opportunity to help the Lord change the lives of a family The Lord suggested that in the Doctrine and Covenants The teacher s duty is to watch over the church always and be with and strengthen them And see that there is no iniquity in the church neither hardness with each other neither lying backbiting nor evil speaking D C 20 53 54 Similarly the priest in the Aaronic Priesthood is given this charge The priest s duty is to preach teach expound exhort and baptize and administer the sacrament And visit the house of each member and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties D C 20 46 47 You may wonder as I did when I was a young teacher and priest how in the world I could rise to those challenges I was never sure how I could exhort in a way that would move a family toward eternal life without offending or seeming to criticize I have learned that the only exhortation that changes hearts comes from the Holy Ghost That occurs most often as we bear testimony of the Savior who was and is the perfect family member As we focus on our love for Him harmony and peace will grow in the homes we visit The Holy Ghost will attend us in our service to families The young priesthood holder may by the way he prays by the way he speaks and by the way he encourages the members of the family bring the influence and example of the Savior to their minds and hearts One wise priesthood leader showed me he understood that He asked my young son to take the lead in a home teaching visit He said that the family might resist his exhortations but he thought the simple teaching and testimony of a boy might more likely penetrate their hardened hearts What can the young elder do to help in the creation of eternal families He may be about to go into the mission field He can pray with all his heart that he will be able to find teach and baptize families I still remember a handsome young man with his lovely bride and their two beautiful little girls sitting with me and my missionary companion one day The Holy Ghost came and testified to them that the gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored They believed enough that they even asked if we could give their two little girls a blessing as they had seen done in one of our sacrament meetings They already had a desire for their children to be blessed but they did not yet understand that the higher blessings would be possible only in the temples of God after they had made covenants I still feel pain to think of that couple and those little girls probably now grown old without the promise of an eternal family Their parents had at least an inkling of the blessings that could be made available to them My hope is that they somehow somewhere may yet have the opportunity to qualify to be an eternal family Other elders going into the field will have the happier experience my son Matthew had He and his companion found a widow with 11 children living in humble circumstances He wanted for them what you want to have an eternal family To my son it looked impossible or at least unlikely at that moment I visited that little city years after my son had baptized the widow and she invited me to meet her family at church I had to wait a while because most of her children with her many grandchildren came from several different chapels in the area One son was faithfully serving in a bishopric many of her children have been blessed by temple covenants and she is sealed in an eternal family As I parted from this dear sister she put her arms around my waist she was very short so she could just barely get to my waist and said Please tell Mateo to come back to Chile before I die She had been given because of those faithful elders the happy anticipation of the greatest of all the gifts of God There are things an elder as he returns from his mission must do to be true to his commitment to seek eternal life for himself and for those he loves There is no more important commitment in time or in eternity than marriage You have heard wise counsel to make marriage a priority in early post mission plans The faithful priesthood servant will do it wisely In considering marriage he will see that he is choosing the parents of his children and the heritage they will have He will make the choice with earnest searching and prayerful consideration He will ensure that the person he marries shares his ideals for family and his convictions of the Lord s purpose for marriage and that she is a person to whom he would be willing to trust his children s happiness President N Eldon Tanner gave wise counsel The parents that you should honor more than any others are the parents of your children to be Those children are entitled to the best parents that it is possible for you to give them clean parents 3 Purity will be your protection and the protection of your children You owe them that blessing Now there are some husbands and fathers listening tonight What can you do My hope is that your desire has increased to make the changes necessary for you and your family to live in the celestial kingdom someday As a priesthood father with your wife at your side you can touch the hearts of each family member to encourage them to look forward to that day You will attend your sacrament meetings with your family you will hold family meetings in which the Holy Ghost is invited you will pray with your wife and family and you will prepare yourself to take your family to the temple You will move with them along the path to an eternal family home You will treat your wife and children the way Heavenly Father has treated you You will follow the example and direction of the Savior to lead your family in His way No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by long suffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned By kindness and pure knowledge which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy and without guile Reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the Holy Ghost and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy D C 121 41 43 The Lord has told priesthood fathers what kind of husbands they are to be He says Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shalt cleave unto her and none else D C 42 22 When the Lord speaks to both the husband and the wife He commands Thou shalt not commit adultery nor do anything like unto it D C 59 6 For youth the Lord has set the standard Children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord Colossians 3 20 and honour thy father and thy mother Exodus 20 12 When the Lord speaks to all in the family His counsel is to love and support each other He asks us to strive to perfect the lives of each member of the family to strengthen the weak reclaim the straying loved one and rejoice in their renewed spiritual strength 4The Lord also asks that we do all we can to help those of our kindred dead to be with us in our eternal home The high priests group leader who has worked diligently to help people find their ancestors and take names to the temple is rescuing those who have gone before There will be thanks in the world to come to those high priests and to those who offer the ordinances because they did not forget their family waiting in the spirit world Prophets have said The most important of the Lord s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home Home Teaching bishopric s work and other Church duties are all important but the most important work is within the walls of your home 5In our home and in our priesthood service the greatest value will be in the small acts that help us and those we love work toward eternal life Those acts may seem small in this life but they will bring everlasting blessings in eternity As we are faithful in our service to help Heavenly Father s children to go home to Him we will qualify for the greeting we all so much want to hear when we finish our earthly ministry These are the words Well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord Matthew 25 21 Among those many things is the promise of an endless posterity My prayer is that we may all qualify and help others to qualify for that supernal blessing in the home of our Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be with you in this evening of worship reflection and dedication We have prayed together Our loving Heavenly Father has heard us We have remembered our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ as we have been touched by hymns of praise to Him We have been inspired to do more to help our Master in His work to lift up and to succor the children of our Heavenly Father Our desire to serve others is magnified by our gratitude for what the Savior has done for us That is why our hearts swell when we hear the words sung Because I have been given much I too must give 1 King Benjamin in his great sermon recorded in the Book of Mormon promised that feeling of gratitude would come see Mosiah 2 17 19 When our faith in Jesus Christ leads us to qualify for the joy of His forgiveness we feel a desire to serve others for Him King Benjamin taught that forgiveness is not accomplished in a single moment He said it this way And now for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you that is for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day that ye may walk guiltless before God I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor every man according to that which he hath such as feeding the hungry clothing the naked visiting the sick and administering to their relief both spiritually and temporally according to their wants Mosiah 4 26 Alma s great companion Amulek also taught the truth that we must continue in our service to Him to retain forgiveness And now behold my beloved brethren I say unto you do not suppose that this is all for after ye have done all these things if ye turn away the needy and the naked and visit not the sick and afflicted and impart of your substance if ye have to those who stand in need I say unto you if ye do not any of these things behold your prayer is vain and availeth you nothing and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith Alma 34 28 I have thought tonight of the women in my life There are 31 women and girls in our family beginning with my wife and progressing to include our three newest great granddaughters Some are here with us this evening Five are under the age of 12 This may be their first meeting in the Conference Center with their sisters in the Savior s Church Each will take a different set of memories and make her own commitments from this experience tonight There are three memories and three commitments that I pray will stay with them over a lifetime and even beyond The memories are of feelings And the commitments are of things to do The feeling of greatest importance is love You have felt the love of the great sister leaders who have spoken And you have felt by the Spirit that they loved you without even knowing you because they felt Heavenly Father s and the Savior s love for you That is why they want so much to serve you and to have you receive the blessings God wants for you You have felt love for others tonight for friends schoolmates neighbors and even someone who just came into your life a stranger That feeling of love is a gift from God The scriptures call it charity and the pure love of Christ Moroni 7 47 You have felt that love tonight and you can receive it often if you seek it A second feeling you have had tonight was the influence of the Holy Ghost Sisters have promised you this day that the Holy Ghost will guide you to find the service the Lord would have you give to others for Him You have felt by the Spirit that their promise was from the Lord and that it is true The Lord said And now verily verily I say unto thee put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good yea to do justly to walk humbly to judge righteously and this is my Spirit D C 11 12 You may have received that blessing tonight For instance a name or a face of someone in need may have come to your mind during this meeting It could have been only a fleeting thought but because of what you heard tonight you will pray about it trusting that God will lead you to do the good He wants for them As such prayers become a pattern in your life you and others will be changed for the better The third feeling you have had tonight is that you want to be closer to the Savior Even the youngest girl here will have felt the reality of the invitation in the song Come follow me the Savior said Then let us in his footsteps tread 2So with those feelings the first thing you must commit to do is to go and serve knowing that you do not go alone When you go to comfort and serve anyone for the Savior He prepares the way before you Now as the returned missionaries here tonight will tell you that doesn t mean that every person behind every door is prepared to welcome you or that every person you try to serve will thank you But the Lord will go before your face to prepare the way Time and again President Thomas S Monson has said he knows the reality of the Lord s promise And whoso receiveth you there I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up D C 84 88 One of the ways He goes before your face is to prepare the heart of a person He has asked you to serve He will prepare your heart as well You will also find that the Lord puts helpers by your side on your right on your left and all around you You do not go alone to serve others for Him He did that for me tonight The Lord arranged a cloud of witnesses Hebrews 12 1 both in words and music to combine and multiply the power of what He wanted me to say I just had to be sure that I could fit my part into His composition I hope and pray that you will feel gratitude and joy as the Lord puts you together with others to serve for Him As you have that experience often and you will you will smile with recognition just as I do whenever we sing Sweet is the work 3You will also smile as you remember this verse And the King shall answer and say unto them Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me Matthew 25 40 The second thing you must do is remember the Lord as you go in service for Him The Lord not only goes before our faces and sends angels to serve with us but He also feels the comfort we give others as if we had given it to Him Every daughter of God who hears and believes the messages of this meeting will ask What will the Lord have me do to help Him give succor to those in need Each sister s situation is unique That is true for my little band of daughters daughters in law granddaughters and great granddaughters To them and to all of Heavenly Father s daughters I repeat the wise counsel of Sister Linda K Burton She has asked you to pray in faith to know what the Lord would have you do in your circumstances And then she spoke of the promise of the sweet comfort the Lord Himself gave to the woman who was criticized for having anointed His head with expensive oil when it might have been sold to help the poor And Jesus said Let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me For ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not always She hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying Verily I say unto you Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her Mark 14 6 9 That short scripture is sweet and wise counsel for the faithful sisters in the Lord s kingdom in tumultuous times You will pray to know whom the Father would have you serve out of love for Him and for our Savior And you will not expect a public memorial following the example of the woman in Mark s scriptural account whose holy deed to honor the Savior of the world is remembered but not her name My hope is that the sisters in our family will do the best they can out of love for God to serve those in need And the third thing I hope they will do is to be personally modest about their good works Yet I will pray that they will accept the counsel of the Lord when He said which I am confident we all need to hear Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven And then He said But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth That thine alms may be in secret and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly Matthew 6 1 3 4 My prayer for the sisters in the kingdom wherever they may be or in whatever circumstances is that their faith in the Savior and gratitude for His Atonement will lead them to do all they can for those God asks them to serve As they do I promise that they will move up the path to become holy women whom the Savior and our Heavenly Father will welcome warmly and reward openly I testify that this is the Church of the resurrected Jesus Christ He is risen He paid the price for all of our sins I know that because of Him we will be resurrected and can have eternal life President Thomas S Monson is His living prophet Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers I witness that we grow closer to the Savior as we out of pure love serve others for Him I so leave you that sure witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters I welcome you to the 186th Annual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I rejoice to be with you and I welcome you warmly I am grateful that you have come to the conference to feel inspiration from heaven and to feel closer to our Heavenly Father and to the Lord Jesus Christ Gathered in this meeting which stretches across the world are millions of disciples of Jesus Christ who are under covenant to always remember Him and serve Him By the miracle of modern technology the separation of time and of vast distances vanishes We meet as if we are all together in one great hall But even more important than our gathering together is in whose name we do so The Lord promised that even with the great number of His disciples on the earth today He would be close to each of us He said to His little band of disciples in 1829 Verily verily I say unto you where two or three are gathered together in my name behold there will I be in the midst of them even so am I in the midst of you D C 6 32 Now numbering more than one or two a multitude of His disciples are gathered in this conference and as promised the Lord is in our midst Because He is a resurrected and glorified being He is not physically everyplace where Saints gather But by the power of the Spirit we can feel that He is here with us today Where and when we feel the closeness of the Savior depend on each of us He gave this instruction And again verily I say unto you my friends I leave these sayings with you to ponder in your hearts with this commandment which I give unto you that ye shall call upon me while I am near Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you seek me diligently and ye shall find me ask and ye shall receive knock and it shall be opened unto you D C 88 62 63 I know of at least two people listening today who want that blessing with all their hearts They will try earnestly to draw nearer to the Lord during this conference They each wrote to me their letters arriving at my office in the same week pleading for the same kind of help Both of them are converts to the Church and have previously received clear testimonies of the love of God the Father and of His Son Jesus Christ the Savior of the world They knew that the Prophet Joseph Smith organized the Church by direct revelation from God and that the keys of the holy priesthood were restored Each felt a witness that keys are in place in the Church today They bore to me their solemn testimony in writing Yet both lamented that feelings of love for the Lord and His love for them were lessening They both wanted with full heart for me to help them regain the joy and the feeling of being loved that was theirs as they came into the kingdom of God Both expressed a fear that if they could not regain in full those feelings of love for the Savior and His Church the trials and tests they faced would finally overcome their faith They are not alone in their concern nor is their test a new one During His mortal ministry the Savior gave us the parable of the seed and the sower The seed was the word of God The sower was the Lord The survival of the seed and its growth depended on the condition of the soil You remember His words And when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up Some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth And when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away And some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them But other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold Who hath ears to hear let him hear Matthew 13 4 9 Again the seed is the word of God The soil is the heart of the person who receives the seed All of us have much in common with the wonderful people who wrote to me for help and reassurance We all have had seeds or the word of God planted in our hearts at one time For some it was in childhood when our parents invited us to be baptized and confirmed by those in authority Others of us were taught by called servants of God Each felt that the seed was good even felt the swelling in our hearts and experienced joy as our hearts and minds seemed to expand All of us have had our faith tested by precious blessings delayed vicious attacks of those who wanted to destroy our faith temptations to sin and selfish interests that reduced our efforts to cultivate and soften the spiritual depths of our hearts Those who are saddened by the loss of the joy they once had are the blessed ones Some do not see the withering of faith within themselves Satan is clever He tells those he wishes to be miserable that the joy they once felt was childish self delusion Today my message to us all is that there will be a precious opportunity in the next few days to choose to have our hearts softened and to receive and nourish the seed The seed is the word of God and it will be poured out on all of us who listen watch and read the proceedings of this conference The music the talks and the testimonies have been prepared by servants of God who have sought diligently for the Holy Ghost to guide them in their preparation They have prayed longer and more humbly as the days of the conference have approached They have prayed to have the power to encourage you to make the choices that will create in your heart a more fertile ground for the good word of God to grow and be fruitful If you listen with the Spirit you will find your heart softened your faith strengthened and your capacity to love the Lord increased Your choice to pray with full purpose of heart will transform your experience in the conference sessions and in the days and months that follow Many of you have already begun At the start of this session you more than listened to the prayer you added your faith to the petition that we will enjoy the blessing of having the Holy Ghost poured out upon us As you added your silent pleading in the name of Jesus Christ you drew closer to Him This is His conference Only the Holy Ghost can bring the blessings the Lord desires for us In His love for us He has promised we can feel that Whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture shall be the will of the Lord shall be the mind of the Lord shall be the word of the Lord shall be the voice of the Lord and the power of God unto salvation Behold this is the promise of the Lord unto you O ye my servants Wherefore be of good cheer and do not fear for I the Lord am with you and will stand by you and ye shall bear record of me even Jesus Christ that I am the Son of the living God that I was that I am and that I am to come D C 68 4 6 You can pray and add your faith each time a servant of God approaches the pulpit that the promise of the Lord in Doctrine and Covenants section 50 will be fulfilled Verily I say unto you he that is ordained of me and sent forth to preach the word of truth by the Comforter in the Spirit of truth doth he preach it by the Spirit of truth or some other way And if it be by some other way it is not of God And again he that receiveth the word of truth doth he receive it by the Spirit of truth or some other way If it be some other way it is not of God Therefore why is it that ye cannot understand and know that he that receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth Wherefore he that preacheth and he that receiveth understand one another and both are edified and rejoice together D C 50 17 22 You can pray as the choir is about to sing The choir director the organists and the choir members have prayed and practiced with a prayer in their hearts and with faith that the music and the words will soften hearts and magnify their power to build others faith They will perform for the Lord as if they were before Him and they will know that our Heavenly Father hears them as surely as He hears their personal prayers Together they have labored with love to make the promise of the Savior to Emma Smith come true For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart yea the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads D C 25 12 If you not only listen but also pray as they sing your prayer and their prayers will be answered with a blessing upon your head as well as theirs You will feel the blessing of the Savior s love and approval All who join in that praise will feel their love for Him grow You might choose to pray as a speaker seems to be coming to an end of his or her message He or she will be praying inwardly to the Father that the Holy Ghost will give him or her the words of testimony that will lift the listeners hearts hopes and determination to always remember the Savior and keep the commandments that He has given us The testimony will not be a recital of the message It will be an affirmation of some truth that the Spirit can carry into the hearts of those who will be praying for help for divine direction and to receive the pure love of Christ True testimony will be given to the speakers Their words may be few but they will be carried into the heart of the humble listener who has come to the conference hungry for the good word of God I know from experience what the faith of good people can do to bring words from the Spirit at the close of a sermon More than once someone has said to me after my testimony How did you know what I so needed to hear I have learned not to be surprised when I cannot remember saying the words I spoke the words of testimony but the Lord was there giving them to me in the moment The promise that the Lord will give us words in the very moment applies especially to testimony see D C 24 6 Listen carefully to the testimonies borne in this conference you will feel closer to the Lord You can sense that I am coming to the moment when I will cap the message I have tried to convey with a testimony of truth Your prayers will help me to be given words of testimony that may help someone longing for an answer to his or her questions I leave you my sure witness that our Heavenly Father the great Elohim loves and knows us every one Under His direction His Son Jehovah was the Creator I testify that Jesus of Nazareth was born the Son of God He healed the sick gave sight to the blind and raised the dead He paid the price of all the sins of each of Heavenly Father s children born into mortality He broke the bands of death for all as He rose from the tomb that first Easter Sunday He lives today a God resurrected and glorious This is the only true Church and He is its chief cornerstone Thomas S Monson is His prophet to all the world The prophets and apostles you will hear in this conference speak for the Lord They are His servants authorized to act for Him He goes before His servants in the world This I know And I so witness in His name even the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brethren we are grateful that the Lord has called Elder Ronald A Rasband Elder Gary E Stevenson and Elder Dale G Renlund as Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ Our hearts our prayers and our faith sustain them We know of their great capacity Yet they will need reassurance in their calls as we all do that the Lord is with them in His work The newest deacon needs that confidence as does the most experienced high priest who receives a new call That confidence grows as you come to see that He called you through His servants My encouragement is to help you know that when you do your part the Lord adds His power to your efforts Any calling we receive in the Lord s kingdom requires more than our human judgment and our personal powers Those calls require help from the Lord which will come Even the new deacon will learn that is true and he will go on learning over the years One of my grandsons is here tonight in his first priesthood session He was ordained a deacon six days ago He may expect that his first performance of a priesthood duty will be passing the sacrament next Sunday My prayer is that he will see that moment as it really is He may think that his work for the Lord is to pass the sacrament tray to people seated in the sacrament meeting But the Lord s purpose is not simply to have people partake of bread and water It is to have them keep a covenant that will move them along the path to eternal life And for that to happen the Lord must give a spiritual experience to the person to whom the deacon offers the tray I have seen that happen once in a care center when a deacon leaned forward to pass the tray to a white haired lady She looked at the bread as if it were precious I have never forgotten her smile as she partook and then reached up to pat the deacon s head saying quite loudly Oh thank you That deacon was simply performing his priesthood duty Yet the Lord then multiplied the deacon s act It was evident that the sister remembered the Savior as she expressed sincere gratitude for a deacon s service She was reassured as he served the sacrament to her that she would have the Spirit to be with her She was not alone that day in the care center Neither was the deacon alone in his modest service A young teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood may not sense as he goes to teach a family that he is a partner with the Lord in His work I remember still the simple testimony of a young home teaching companion who came into our home The Spirit confirmed his words to me and to my family He may not remember that day but I do The Lord will magnify the efforts of a young man again when he is called to become a priest The first baptism he performs for instance may be of a young person he does not know He may be worried about whether he will say the right words and perform the ordinance correctly But the Lord whose servant he is will magnify his calling The person he baptizes has chosen to move along the path to eternal life The Lord will do His greater part He did it for me once when the boy I baptized tears streaming down his face said in my ear I m clean I m clean As you move from one priesthood service to another you will see the Lord is in the work with you I learned this from meeting an elders quorum president in a stake conference years ago In the conference there were more than 40 names presented of men who were to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood The stake president leaned over to me and whispered Those men were all less active prospective elders In amazement I asked the president what his program was to rescue these men He pointed to a young man in the back of the chapel He said There he is Most of these men have been brought back because of that elders quorum president He was on the back row dressed casually his legs stretched out with his battered boots crossed in front of him I asked the stake president to introduce me to him after the meeting When we met I told the young man I was surprised by what he had done and asked him how he did it He shrugged his shoulders He obviously didn t think he deserved any credit Then he said softly I know every inactive guy in this town Most of them have pickup trucks I have a truck too I wash my pickup where they wash theirs In time they become my friends Then I wait until something goes wrong in their lives It always does They tell me about it I listen and I don t find fault Then when they say There is something wrong in my life There just has to be something better than this I tell them what is missing and where they can find it Sometimes they believe me and when they do I take them with me You can see why he was modest It was because he knew he had done his small part and the Lord was doing the rest It was the Lord who had touched the hearts of those men in their troubles It was the Lord who had given them the feeling that there must be something better for them and a hope that they could find it The young man who like you was a servant of the Lord simply believed that if he did his small part the Lord would help those men along the path to home and to the happiness only He could give them This man also knew the Lord had called him as elders quorum president because he would do his part There will be times in your service when you won t have the remarkable and visible success of that young elders quorum president That is the time when you will need to be confident that the Lord knowing you would do your part in the work called you through His authorized servants Having faith in the call from the Lord s servants was crucial in the missionary service of my great grandfather Henry Eyring He was baptized on March 11 1855 in St Louis Missouri Erastus Snow ordained him to the office of a priest shortly thereafter The president of the St Louis Stake John H Hart called him to serve a mission to the Cherokee Nation on October 6 1 He was ordained an elder on October 11 He left on horseback for the Cherokee Mission on October 24 He was 20 years old and a convert of only seven months If any priesthood holder had a reason to feel unqualified or unprepared it was Henry Eyring The only reason he could have had the courage to go was that he knew in his heart that God had called him through His authorized servants It was the source of his courage That must be the source of our courage to persevere whatever our callings in the priesthood After Elder Eyring had served for three difficult years and upon the death of the mission president Henry was nominated and sustained as president of the mission in a meeting held on October 6 1858 He was surprised and as shocked as a new deacon would be He wrote It was quite unexpected to me to be called to that responsible office but as it was the will of the brethren I cheerfully accepted feeling at the same time my great weakness and lack of experience 2The now President Eyring traveled to the Cherokee Creek and Choctaw Nations in 1859 Through his efforts the Lord added as Henry recorded a number to the church He organized two branches but noted that very few are alive in the cause 3A year later Henry was faced with the difficult reality that the political leaders among the people he was serving no longer permitted the Latter day Saint missionaries to do their work As he pondered what he should do he recalled the instruction from his previous mission president indicating that he should prolong his mission until 1859 4In October of that year Henry wrote to President Brigham Young for direction but he did not receive a reply to his question Henry recorded Not being able to hear anything from the Presidency of the Church I called upon the Lord in prayer asking him to reveal to me his mind and will in regard to my remaining longer or going up to Zion He continued The following dream was given to me in answer to my prayer I dreamt I had arrived in Salt Lake City and immediately went to President Brigham Young s office where I found him I said to him President Young I have left my mission have come of my own accord but if there is anything wrong in this I am willing to return and finish my mission In the dream the prophet replied You have stayed long enough it is all right Henry wrote in his journal Having had dreams before which were literally fulfilled I had faith to believe that this also would be and consequently commenced at once to prepare for a start He arrived in Salt Lake City on August 29 1860 having walked most of the way Two days later he walked into the office of President Brigham Young 5Henry described the experience in these words I called upon President Young who received me very kindly I said to him President Young I have come without being sent for if I have done wrong I am willing to return and finish my mission Brigham Young answered It is all right we have been looking for you Henry described his joy saying Thus my dream was literally fulfilled 6His joy came from a confirmation that the Lord had been working with and watching over him He learned what is true for all of us that the Lord s servants are inspired to know the Lord s will And Henry Eyring had confirmed what I know as well that the prophet as the president of the priesthood is inspired of God to watch over and care for the Lord s servants and to call them Whatever your calling in the priesthood you may have at times felt Heavenly Father was unaware of you You can pray to know His will and with the honest desire to do whatever He asks you to do you will receive an answer Heavenly Father will allow you to feel that He knows you that He appreciates your service and that you are becoming worthy of the greeting from the Lord you want so much to hear Well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord 7It is my prayer that every priesthood holder will reach out in faith to rescue every soul for whom he is responsible God will add His power to His servant s efforts Hearts of people will be touched to make the choices that will bring them along the gospel path toward happiness and away from sorrow It is my prayer as well that every priesthood holder will feel the loving and watchful care of Heavenly Father of the Savior and of the prophet of God in his calling in the priesthood I bear you my special witness that we are in the service of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ I testify that He has called you and me into His service knowing our capacities and the help we will need He will bless our efforts beyond our fondest expectations as we give our all in His service I testify that God s prophet who is the president of all the priesthood in the earth is inspired of God I am grateful for the examples of faithful priesthood holders everywhere Heavenly Father and the Savior are grateful that you do your part They know you They watch over you and They love you In the name of Jesus Christ amen

My dear brothers and sisters I am grateful to be with you on this Sabbath day in the general conference of the Lord s Church I have felt as you have the Spirit the Holy Ghost testifying to the words of truth we have heard spoken and sung My purpose today is to increase your desire and your determination to claim the gift promised to each of us after we were baptized During our confirmation we heard these words Receive the Holy Ghost 1 From that moment our lives changed forever We can if we live worthy of it have the blessing of the Spirit to be with us not only now and then as in such remarkable experiences as we ve had today but always You know from the words of the sacrament prayer how that promise is fulfilled O God the Eternal Father we ask thee in the name of thy Son Jesus Christ to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son and witness unto thee O God the Eternal Father that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them And then comes the glorious promise That they may always have his Spirit to be with them D C 20 77 emphasis added To always have the Spirit with us is to have the guidance and direction of the Holy Ghost in our daily lives We can for instance be warned by the Spirit to resist the temptation to do evil For that reason alone it is easy to see why the Lord s servants have tried to increase our desire to worship God in our sacrament meetings If we partake of the sacrament in faith the Holy Ghost will then be able to protect us and those we love from the temptations that come with increasing intensity and frequency The companionship of the Holy Ghost makes what is good more attractive and temptation less compelling That alone should be enough to make us determined to qualify for the Spirit to be with us always Just as the Holy Ghost strengthens us against evil He also gives us the power to discern truth from falsehood The truth that matters most is verified only by revelation from God Our human reason and the use of our physical senses will not be enough We live in a time when even the wisest will be hard pressed to distinguish truth from clever deception The Lord taught His Apostle Thomas who wanted physical evidence of the Savior s Resurrection by touching His wounds that revelation is safer evidence Jesus saith unto him Thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed John 20 29 The truths that mark the way home to God are verified by the Holy Ghost We cannot go to the grove and see the Father and the Son speak to the young Joseph Smith No physical evidence or any logical argument can establish that Elijah came as promised to confer the priesthood keys now held and exercised by a living prophet Thomas S Monson Confirmation of truth comes to a son or daughter of God who has claimed the right to receive the Holy Ghost Since falsehoods and lies may be presented to us at any time we need a constant influence of the Spirit of Truth to spare us moments of doubt While a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles George Q Cannon urged that we make a constant quest for the Spirit to be with us He promised and I promise it as well that if we pursue that course we will never lack for knowledge of the truth never be in doubt or in darkness and our faith will be strong our joy full 2We need that constant help from the companionship of the Holy Ghost for yet another reason The death of a loved one may come unexpectedly It is the witness from the Holy Ghost of the reality of a loving Heavenly Father and a resurrected Savior that gives us hope and comfort at the loss of a loved one That testimony must be fresh when death occurs So for many reasons we need the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost We desire it yet we know from experience that it is not easy to maintain We each think say and do things in our daily lives that can offend the Spirit The Lord taught us that the Holy Ghost will be our constant companion when our hearts are full of charity and when virtue garnishes our thoughts unceasingly see D C 121 45 For those who are struggling with the high standard needed to qualify for the gift of the Spirit s companionship I offer this encouragement You have had times when you have felt the influence of the Holy Ghost It may have happened for you today You can treat those moments of inspiration like the seed of faith that Alma described see Alma 32 28 Plant each one You can do that by acting on the prompting you felt The most valuable inspiration will be for you to know what God would have you do If it is to pay tithing or to visit a grieving friend you should do it Whatever it is do it When you demonstrate your willingness to obey the Spirit will send you more impressions of what God would have you do for Him As you obey the impressions from the Spirit will come more frequently becoming closer and closer to constant companionship Your power to choose the right will increase You can know when these impressions to act for Him are from the Spirit rather than from your own desires When the impressions square with what the Savior and His living prophets and apostles have said you can choose to obey with confidence Then the Lord will send His Spirit to attend you For example if you receive a spiritual impression to honor the Sabbath day especially when it seems difficult God will send His Spirit to help That help came to my father years ago when his work took him to Australia He was alone on a Sunday and he wanted to take the sacrament He could find no information about Latter day Saint meetings So he started walking He prayed at each intersection to know which way to turn After walking and making turns for an hour he stopped to pray again He felt an impression to turn down a particular street Soon he began to hear singing coming from the ground floor of an apartment building close by He looked in at the window and saw a few people seated near a table covered with a white cloth and sacrament trays Now that may not seem like much to you but it was something wonderful to him He knew the promise of the sacrament prayer had been fulfilled Always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them that they may always have his Spirit to be with them D C 20 77 That was only one example of a time when he prayed and then did what the Spirit told him God wanted him to do He kept at it over the years as you and I will He never talked about his spirituality He just kept on doing little things for the Lord that he was prompted to do Whenever some group of Latter day Saints asked him to speak to them he did it It didn t matter if it was 10 people or 50 or how tired he was He bore his testimony of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and of the prophets whenever the Spirit urged him to do it His highest callings in the Church were to the Bonneville Utah Stake high council where he weeded on the stake farm and he taught a Sunday School class Over the years when he needed it the Holy Ghost was there as his companion I stood next to my father in a hospital room My mother his wife of 41 years lay on the bed We had watched her for hours We began to see the lines of pain disappear from her face The fingers of her hands which had been clenched into fists relaxed Her arms came to rest at her sides The pains of decades of cancer were ending I saw on her face a look of peace She took a few short breaths then a gasp and then lay still We stood there waiting to see if another breath would come Finally Dad said quietly A little girl has gone home He shed no tears That was because the Holy Ghost had long before given him a clear picture of who she was where she came from what she had become and where she was going The Spirit had testified to him many times of a loving Heavenly Father of a Savior who had broken the power of death and of the reality of the temple sealing he shared with his wife and family The Spirit had long before assured him that her goodness and faith had qualified her for the return to a heavenly home where she would be remembered as a wonderful child of promise and be welcomed home with honor For my dad that was more than a hope The Holy Ghost had made it a reality for him Now some might say that his words and the pictures in his mind about a heavenly home were just a sweet sentiment the clouded judgment of a husband at the moment of his loss But he knew eternal truth the only way you can know it He was a scientist who searched for truth about the physical world throughout his entire adult life He used the tools of science well enough to be honored by his peers across the world Much of what he did in chemistry came from seeing in his mind s eye molecules moving about and then confirming his vision by experiments in a laboratory But he had followed a different course to discover the truths that mattered most to him and to each of us Only through the Holy Ghost can we see people and events as God sees them That gift continued in the hospital after his wife died We gathered up my mother s things to take home Dad stopped to thank every nurse and doctor we met on the way out to the car I remember I felt with some irritation that we should leave to be alone with our grief I realize now that he saw things only the Holy Ghost could have shown him He saw those people as angels sent by God to watch over his sweetheart They may have seen themselves as health care professionals but Dad was thanking them for their service on behalf of the Savior The influence of the Holy Ghost continued with him as we arrived at the home of my parents We talked for a few minutes in the living room Dad excused himself to go into his nearby bedroom After a few minutes he walked back into the living room He had a pleasant smile He walked up to us and said quietly I was worried that Mildred would arrive in the spirit world alone I thought she might feel lost in the crowd Then he said brightly I prayed just now I know Mildred is all right My mother was there to meet her I remember smiling as he said that imagining my grandmother her short legs pumping rushing through a crowd to be sure she was there to meet and embrace her daughter in law as she arrived Now one of the reasons my father asked for and received that comfort was because he had always prayed in faith since his childhood He was used to getting answers that came to his heart to give comfort and direction In addition to having a habit of prayer he knew the scriptures and the words of living prophets So he recognized the familiar whisperings of the Spirit which you may have felt today The companionship of the Spirit had more than comforted and guided him It changed him through the Atonement of Jesus Christ When we accept that promise of having the Spirit with us always the Savior can grant us the purification required for eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God see D C 14 7 You remember the Savior s words Now this is the commandment Repent all ye ends of the earth and come unto me and be baptized in my name that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day 3 Nephi 27 20 Those commandments come with this promise from the Lord And now verily verily I say unto thee put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good yea to do justly to walk humbly to judge righteously and this is my Spirit Verily verily I say unto you I will impart unto you of my Spirit which shall enlighten your mind which shall fill your soul with joy D C 11 12 13 I bear you my testimony that God the Father lives that the resurrected Jesus Christ leads His Church that President Thomas S Monson holds all the keys of the priesthood and that revelation through the Holy Ghost guides and sustains The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and its humble members I further testify to you that these wonderful men who have today been speaking to us as witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are called of God I know that the Spirit led President Monson to call them And as you listened to them and their testimonies the Holy Spirit confirmed to you what I now say to you They are called of God I sustain them and love them and know that the Lord loves them and will sustain them in their service And I do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters it is a joy for me to extend my love to you in this general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints That joy comes from the witness of the Spirit that the love of the Savior reaches out to each of you and to all of Heavenly Father s children Our Heavenly Father wishes to bless His children spiritually and temporally He understands each of their needs their pains and their hopes When we offer succor to anyone the Savior feels it as if we reached out to succor Him He told us that was true when He described a future moment we all will have when we see Him after our life in this world is complete A picture in my mind of that day has grown more vivid in the days that I have prayed and fasted to know what to say this morning The Lord s description of that future interview was given to His disciples and it describes what we want with all our hearts to be true for us as well Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world For I was an hungred and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye took me in Naked and ye clothed me I was sick and ye visited me I was in prison and ye came unto me Then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee Or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee And the King shall answer and say unto them Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me 1You and I want that warm welcome from the Savior But how can we deserve it There are more hungry homeless and lonely children of Heavenly Father than we can possibly reach And the numbers grow ever farther from our reach So the Lord has given us something that we each can do It is a commandment so simple that a child can understand it It is a commandment with a wonderful promise for those in need and for us It is the law of the fast The words in the book of Isaiah are the Lord s description of the commandment and the blessing available to those of us in His Church Is not this the fast that I have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday And the Lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not 2So the Lord has given us a simple commandment with a marvelous promise In the Church today we are offered the opportunity to fast once a month and give a generous fast offering through our bishop or branch president for the benefit of the poor and the needy Some of what you give will be used to help those around you perhaps someone in your own family The Lord s servants will pray and fast for the revelation to know whom to help and what help to give That which is not needed to help people in your local Church unit will become available to bless other Church members across the world who are in need The commandment to fast for the poor has many blessings attached to it President Spencer W Kimball called failing to follow that law a sin of omission with a heavy cost He wrote Rich promises are made by the Lord to those who fast and assist the needy Inspiration and spiritual guidance will come with righteousness and closeness to our Heavenly Father To omit to do this righteous act of fasting would deprive us of these blessings 3I received one of those blessings just a few weeks ago Since general conference falls on a weekend that would normally include the fast and testimony meeting I fasted and prayed to know how I should still obey the commandment to care for those in need On a Saturday still fasting I woke at 6 00 and prayed again I felt impressed to look at the world news There I read this report Tropical Cyclone Pam destroyed many homes as it made a direct hit on Port Vila the capital of Vanuatu It killed at least six people in Vanuatu the first confirmed from one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall Hardly a tree stood straight as the cyclone bellowed across the Pacific island nation 4World Vision s emergency assessment team planned to view damage after the storm died down They advised residents to seek shelter in sturdy buildings such as universities and schools And then they said The strongest thing they ve got is cement churches said Inga Mepham from CARE International Some of them don t have that It s hard to find a structure that you d think would be able to withstand a Category 5 storm 5When I read that I remembered visiting little homes on Vanuatu I could picture in my mind the people huddled in homes being destroyed by winds And then I remembered the warm welcome to me of the people of Vanuatu I thought of them and their neighbors fleeing to the safety of our cement chapel Then I pictured the bishop and the Relief Society president walking among them giving comfort blankets food to eat and water to drink I could picture the frightened children huddled together They are so far away from the home where I read that report and yet I knew what the Lord would be doing through His servants I knew that what made it possible for them to succor those children of Heavenly Father was fast offerings given freely by the Lord s disciples who were far away from them but close to the Lord So I didn t wait for Sunday I took a fast offering to my bishop that morning I know that my offering may be used by the bishop and Relief Society president to help someone in my neighborhood My small offering may not be needed near where my family and I live but the local surplus could reach even as far as Vanuatu Other storms and tragedies will come across the world to people the Lord loves and whose sorrows He feels Part of your fast offering and mine this month will be used to help someone somewhere whose relief the Lord will feel as if it were His own Your fast offering will do more than help feed and clothe bodies It will heal and change hearts The fruit of a free will offering may be the desire in the heart of the recipient to reach out to others in need That happens across the world It happened in the life of Sister Abie Turay who lives in Sierra Leone A civil war began in 1991 It ravaged the country for years Sierra Leone was already one of the poorest countries in the world During the war it was unclear who controlled the country banks closed government offices were shuttered police forces were ineffective against rebel forces and there was chaos killing and sorrow Tens of thousands of people lost their lives and more than two million people were forced from their homes to avoid the slaughter 6Even in such times The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints grew One of the first branches was organized in the city where Sister Turay lived Her husband was the first branch president He served as a district president during the civil war When guests visit Sister Turay s home now she loves to show them two treasures from the war a blue and white striped shirt she got from a bale of used clothing given by members of the Church and a blanket now worn and riddled with holes 7She says This shirt is the first clothing I received I used to wear it to go to work it was so good It made me feel so beautiful I didn t have other clothes During the war this blanket kept us warm me and my children When the rebels would come to attack us this is the only thing I could lay my hands on as we fled to the bush to hide So we would take the blanket with us It would keep us warm and keep the mosquitos away from us 8 Sister Turay speaks of her gratitude for a mission president who would make his way into the war torn country with money in his pocket Those funds from the fast offering donations of people like you allowed the Saints to buy food that most Sierra Leoneans could not afford 9Sister Turay speaking of those who were generous enough to donate for them to survive says When I think of the people who did this I feel that they were sent by God because ordinary human beings made this kind gesture for us 10A visitor from the United States sat with Abie not long ago During his time with her he found his eyes drawn to a set of scriptures that were on the table He could tell that they were a treasure well marked with notes in the columns The pages were worn some were torn The cover was detached from the binding He held the scriptures in his hand and gently turned the pages As he did he found a yellow copy of a tithing donation slip He could see that in a country where a dollar was worth its weight in gold Abie Turay had paid one dollar as her tithing one dollar to the missionary fund and one dollar as a fast offering for those who in her words were truly poor The visitor closed Sister Turay s scriptures and thought as he stood with this faithful African mother that he was on sacred ground 11Just as the receipt of the blessing of your fast offering and mine can change hearts so does fasting for the good of another Even a child can feel it Many children and some adults may for personal reasons find a 24 hour fast difficult It can be in the words of Isaiah felt that the fast has afflicted their soul Wise parents recognize that possibility and so are careful to follow the counsel of President Joseph F Smith Better to teach them the principle and let them observe it when they are old enough to choose intelligently 12I saw the blessing in that counsel recently One of my grandsons had found a 24 hour fast beyond his powers of endurance But his wise parents still placed the principle in his heart One of his school friends recently lost a young cousin to accidental death My grandson asked his mother on fast day at about the time he had always felt the fast was too hard to continue whether it would make his grieving friend feel better if he continued his fast His question was the confirmation of President Joseph F Smith s counsel My grandson had come to the point where he not only understood the principle of the fast but it had also been planted in his heart He had come to feel that his fasting and prayers would lead to a blessing from God for someone in need If he lives the principle often enough it will bring the wonderful effects in his own life as promised by the Lord He will have the spiritual blessing of power to receive inspiration and greater capacity to resist temptation We do not know all the reasons why Jesus Christ went into the wilderness to fast and to pray But we know at least one of the effects the Savior completely resisted Satan s temptations to misuse His divine power The brief time we fast every month and the small amount we offer for the poor may give us only a small part of the change in our natures to have no more desire to do evil But there is a great promise even as we do all that we reasonably can to pray to fast and to donate for those in need Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am 13I pray that we will claim those great blessings for ourselves and for our families I bear my witness that Jesus is the Christ that in His Church we are invited to help Him as He cares for the poor in His way and that He promises everlasting blessings will come from our helping Him In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful for the trust to speak to holders of the priesthood of God in all the earth I feel the weight of that opportunity because I know something of the trust that the Lord has placed in you With your acceptance of the priesthood you have received the right to speak and to act in the name of God That right will become a reality only as you receive inspiration from God Only then will you be able to speak in His name And only then can you act in His name You might have made the mistake of thinking Oh that isn t so difficult I could get inspiration if I am ever asked to give a talk or if I ever need to give a priesthood blessing Or the young deacon or teacher might take comfort in the thought When I am older or when I am called as a missionary then I will know what God would say and what God would do But think of the day when you must know what God would say and what He would do It has already come for us all wherever you are in your calling in the priesthood I grew up in the mission field in the eastern United States during World War II The members of the Church lived far apart and there was strict gas rationing I was the only deacon in the branch The members gave their fast offering envelopes to the branch president when they came to fast and testimony meeting in our home When I was 13 years old we moved to Utah to live in a large ward I remember my first assignment to walk to homes to collect fast offerings I looked at the name on one of the envelopes I was given and noticed the last name was the same as one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon So I knocked on the door with confidence The man opened the door looked at me scowled and then barked at me to go away I went away with my head down That was nearly 70 years ago but I still remember the feeling I had that day on the doorstep that there was something I was supposed to have said or done If only I had prayed in faith as I went out that day I might have been inspired to stand a moment longer on that doorstep smile and say something like It is good to meet you Thank you for what you and your family have given in the past I look forward to seeing you next month Had I said and done that he might have been even more irritated and even offended But I know now how I might have felt Rather than feeling sadness or failure as I walked away I might have felt the soft commendation in my mind and heart Well done All of us must speak and act in the name of God in moments when our unaided judgment will not be enough without inspiration Those moments can come upon us when there is not time to make preparation That has happened to me often It did many years ago in a hospital when a father told me and my companion that the doctors had told him that his critically injured three year old daughter would die within minutes As I placed my hands on the one spot on her head not covered with bandages I had to know as God s servant what He would do and say The words came to my mind and my lips that she would live The doctor standing by me snorted in disgust and asked me to get out of the way I walked out of that hospital room with a feeling of peace and love The little girl lived and walked down the aisle into a sacrament meeting on my last day in that city I still remember the joy and satisfaction I felt from what I had said and done in the Lord s service for that little girl and her family The difference in my feelings at the hospital and the sadness I felt as I walked away from that door as a deacon came from what I had learned about the connection of prayer to priesthood power As a deacon I had not yet learned that the power to speak and act in God s name requires revelation and that to have it when we need it requires praying and working in faith for the companionship of the Holy Ghost On the evening before I went to that door for fast offerings I had said my prayers at bedtime But for weeks and months before that phone call came from the hospital I had followed a pattern of prayer and made the effort that President Joseph F Smith taught will allow God to give us the inspiration necessary for us to have power in the priesthood He put it simply We do not have to cry unto him with many words We do not have to weary him with long prayers What we do need and what we should do as Latter day Saints for our own good is to go before him often to witness unto him that we remember him and that we are willing to take upon us his name keep his commandments work righteousness and that we desire his Spirit to help us 1And then President Smith told us what we should pray for as his servants pledged to speak and act for God He said What do you pray for You pray that God may recognize you that he may hear your prayers and that he may bless you with his Spirit 2It is not a matter so much of which words to use but it will take some patience It is an approach to your Heavenly Father with the intent to be recognized by Him personally He is the God above all the Father of all and yet willing to give undivided attention to one of His children That may be why the Savior used the words Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name 3It is easier to get the proper feeling of reverence when you are kneeling or bowing your head but it is possible to feel that you are approaching your Heavenly Father in less formal and even in silent prayer as you will often need to do in your priesthood service There will be noise and people around you most of your waking day God hears your silent prayers but you may have to learn to shut out the distractions because the moment you need the connection with God may not come in quiet times President Smith suggested that you will need to pray that God will recognize your call to serve Him He already knows about your call in complete detail He called you and by praying to Him about your call He will reveal more for you to know 4I will give you an example of what a home teacher might do as he prays You may already know that you are to Visit the house of each member exhorting them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties Watch over the church always and be with and strengthen them And see that there is no iniquity in the church neither hardness with each other neither lying backbiting nor evil speaking And see that the church meet together often and also see that all the members do their duty 5Now even for the experienced home teacher and his junior companion that is clearly impossible without the help of the Holy Ghost Think of the families or even individuals you have been called to serve Human judgment and good intentions will not be enough So you will pray for the way to know their hearts to know what things are amiss in the lives and the hearts of people whom you don t know well and who are not anxious to have you know them You will need to know what God would have you do to help them and to do it all as nearly as you can feeling God s love for them It is because you have such important and difficult priesthood calls that President Smith suggests that when you pray you always plead with God that He will bless you with His Spirit You will need the Holy Ghost not once but as much as God will grant it to you for your constant companion That is why we must always pray that God will guide us in our service to His children Because you cannot rise to your priesthood potential without the Spirit going with you you are a personal target for the enemy of all happiness If he can tempt you to sin he can lessen your power to be led by the Spirit and so reduce your power in the priesthood That is why President Smith said that you should always pray that God will warn and protect you from evil 6He warns us in many ways Warnings are part of the plan of salvation Prophets apostles stake presidents bishops and missionaries all raise the warning voice to escape calamity through faith in Jesus Christ repentance and making and keeping sacred covenants As a priesthood holder you are to be part of the warning voice of the Lord But you need to heed the warning yourself You will not survive spiritually without the protection of the companionship of the Holy Ghost in your daily life You must pray for it and work to have it Only with that guide will you be able to find your way along the strait and narrow path through the mists of evil The Holy Ghost will be your guide as He reveals truth when you study the words of prophets Getting that guidance will take more than casual listening and reading You will need to pray and work in faith to put the words of truth down into your heart You must pray that God will bless you with His Spirit that He will lead you into all truth and show you the right way That is how He will warn and guide you into the right path in your life and in your priesthood service General conference provides a great opportunity to let the Lord strengthen your power to serve in the priesthood of God You can prepare yourself as I m sure you have for this conference with prayer You can join your faith with those who will pray in the conference They will pray for many blessings on many people They will pray for the Spirit to come upon the prophet as the Lord s mouthpiece They will pray for the Apostles and all of the servants called by God That includes you from the newest deacon to the seasoned high priest and some both old and young who may soon go to the spirit world where they will hear Well done thou good and faithful servant 7That salutation will go to some who will be surprised by it They may never have held high office in the kingdom of God on the earth Some may have felt that they saw little result from their labors or that some opportunities to serve were never given to them Others may feel that their time of service was cut shorter in this life than they had hoped It will not be the offices held or the time served that will be weighed in the balance with the Lord We know this from the Lord s parable of the laborers in the vineyard where the pay was the same regardless of how long they served or where They will be rewarded for how they served 8I know a man a dear friend whose mortal service in the vineyard ended last night at 11 00 He had been treated for cancer for years During those years of treatment and of terrible pain and difficulty he accepted a call to hold meetings with and be responsible for members in his ward whose children were gone from their homes some were widows His calling was to help them find comfort in sociality and gospel learning When he got the final sobering prognosis that he had only a short time to live his bishop was away for a business trip Two days later he sent a message to his bishop through his high priests group leader He said this about his assignment I understand the bishop is out of town so I m in action I m thinking of a meeting for our group next Monday Two members can take us for a tour of the Conference Center We could use some members to drive them and some Scouts to push wheelchairs Depending upon who signs up we may have enough oldsters to do it ourselves but it would be good to know we have backup if needed It could also be a good family night for the helpers to bring their families as well Anyway let me know before I post the plan Thanks And then he surprised the bishop with a phone call Without reference to his own condition or his valiant efforts in his assignment he asked Bishop is there anything I could do for you Only the Holy Ghost could have allowed him to feel the bishop s load when his own load was so crushing And only the Spirit could have made it possible for him to create a plan to serve his brothers and sisters with the same precision he used in planning Scouting events when he was young With a prayer of faith God can grant us power in the priesthood for whatever circumstance we may be in It simply requires that we ask in humility for the Spirit to show us what God would have us say and do do it and continue to live worthy of that gift I bear you my testimony that God the Father lives loves us and hears our every prayer I bear testimony that Jesus is the living Christ whose Atonement makes it possible for us to be purified and so be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost I testify that with our faith and diligence we can one day hear the words that will bring us joy Well done thou good and faithful servant 9 I pray that we will receive that wonderful benediction from the Master we serve In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved sisters it has been a joy for me to be with you I ve thought of my mother my wife my daughters my daughters in law my granddaughters a number of whom are here This wonderful program has made me appreciate them more I recognize that having had such a family and such a wonderful family life comes from their having the Savior at the center of each of their lives We have remembered Him tonight in music in prayers and through inspired sermons One of the attributes of the Savior we most appreciate is His infinite compassion Tonight you have felt He knows you and loves you You have felt His love for those seated around you They are your sisters spirit daughters of our Heavenly Father He cares for them as He cares for you He understands all their sorrows He wants to succor them My message to you tonight is that you can and must be an important part of His giving comfort to those who need comfort You can play your part best if you know more of how He answers those prayers for help Many are praying to Heavenly Father for relief for help in carrying their burdens of grief loneliness and fear Heavenly Father hears those prayers and understands their needs He and His Beloved Son the resurrected Jesus Christ have promised help Jesus Christ gave this sweet promise Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls For my yoke is easy and my burden is light 1The burdens His faithful servants must carry in life are made lighter by His Atonement The burden of sin can be taken away but the trials of mortal life for good people can still be heavy burdens You have seen such tests in the lives of good people you love You have felt a desire to help them There is a reason for your feeling of compassion for them You are a covenant member of the Church of Jesus Christ A great change began in your heart when you came into the Church You made a covenant and you received a promise that began changing your very nature Alma described in his words at the Waters of Mormon what you promised at your baptism and what it will mean to you and everyone around you especially in your families He was speaking to those who were about to make the covenants you have made and they also received the promise that the Lord made to you Behold here are the waters of Mormon for thus were they called and now as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God and to be called his people and are willing to bear one another s burdens that they may be light Yea and are willing to mourn with those that mourn yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places that ye may be in even until death that ye may be redeemed of God and be numbered with those of the first resurrection that ye may have eternal life 2That is why you have a feeling to want to help a person struggling to move forward under a load of grief and difficulty You promised that you would help the Lord make their burdens light and be comforted You were given the power to help lighten those loads when you received the gift of the Holy Ghost When He was about to be crucified the Savior described the way He helps lighten loads and gives strength to carry them He knew that His disciples would grieve He knew that they would fear for their future He knew they would feel uncertain of their capacity to move forward So He gave them the promise that He makes to us and to all His true disciples And I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever Even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you 3Then He promised But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid 4In just the past few weeks I have seen that promise of sending the Holy Ghost fulfilled in the lives of children of God who were pleading in prayer that their burdens would be lightened The miracle of the loads being lightened came in a way the Lord promised He and Heavenly Father sent the Holy Ghost as the Comforter to His disciples to help Recently three generations of a family were grieving at the death of a five year old boy He died accidentally while with his family on a vacation I was granted the opportunity to watch once again how the Lord blesses the faithful with relief and the strength to endure I watched the way the Lord made their great burden lighter I was with them as the Lord s covenant servant as you will be often in your life to mourn with those that mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort 5Because I knew that was true I was pleased and at peace when the grandparents invited me to meet with them and the parents of the little boy before the funeral I prayed to know how I could help the Lord comfort them They sat down with me in our living room I had warmed the room on a cold night with a small fire in the fireplace I had felt to tell them that I loved them I told them that I had felt the Lord s love for them In just a few words I tried to tell them that I mourned for them but that only the Lord knew and could experience perfectly their pain and grief After saying those few words I felt impressed to listen with love while they talked about their feelings In the hour we sat together they spoke far more than I did I could feel in their voices and see in their eyes that the Holy Ghost was touching them In words of simple testimony they spoke of what happened and how they felt The Holy Ghost had already given them the peace that comes with the hope of eternal life when their son who died without sin could be theirs forever When I gave them each a priesthood blessing I gave thanks for the influence of the Holy Ghost that was there The Comforter had come bringing hope courage and increased strength for all of us That night I saw demonstrated how the Lord works with us to lighten the loads of His people You remember in the Book of Mormon when His people were nearly crushed by the burdens placed upon their backs by fierce taskmasters The people pleaded for relief as many of those we love and serve do Here is the record which I know is true And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders that even you cannot feel them upon your backs even while you are in bondage and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter and that ye may know of a surety that I the Lord God do visit my people in their afflictions And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light yea the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord 6I have seen that miracle time and time again We lighten the loads of others best by helping the Lord strengthen them That is why the Lord included in our charge to comfort others the command to be His witnesses at all times and in all places The father and the mother of the little boy bore witness of the Savior that evening in my living room The Holy Ghost came and all were comforted The parents were strengthened The burden of grief did not disappear but they were made able to bear the sorrow Their faith increased And their strength will continue to grow as they ask for it and live for it The Spirit s witness of the Atonement that came that night also strengthened Job to carry his load For I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth And though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God 7It was that witness of the Spirit that gave him strength to endure He would pass through mourning and the lack of comfort from people around him to see the joy that would come to the faithful after passing faithfully through their trials It was true for Job Blessings came to him in this life The story of Job ends with this miracle So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren After this lived Job an hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generations So Job died being old and full of days 8It was the witness of the Spirit of the coming Atonement which saw Job through the tests life is intended to include for all of us That is part of the great plan of happiness the Father gave us He allowed His Son to provide by His atoning sacrifice the hope that comforts us no matter how hard the way home to Him may be The Father and the Son send the Holy Ghost to comfort and strengthen disciples of the Master in their journey I saw this miracle of comfort as I arrived outside the chapel where the funeral of the little boy was to be held I was stopped by a lovely young woman I did not recognize She said that she was coming to the funeral to mourn and to give comfort if she could She said that she had come to the funeral in part for comfort for herself She told me that her first child had died recently She was carrying in her arms a beautiful little girl I leaned toward her to look into the little girl s smiling face I asked the baby s mother What is her name Her quick and cheerful answer was Her name is Joy Joy always comes after sorrow She was bearing her witness to me I could see that the peace and comfort had come to her from the only sure source Only God knows hearts and so only He can say in truth I know how you feel So I can only imagine both her joy and the sorrow that preceded it but the Lord who loves her knows I can know only partially how much He feels joy each time you as His disciple help Him bring a moment of peace and joy to a child of our Heavenly Father I bear my witness that the Lord has asked each of us His disciples to help bear one another s burdens We have promised to do it I bear my testimony that the Lord through His Atonement and Resurrection has broken the power of death I give my witness that the living Christ sends the Holy Ghost the Comforter to those we are pledged to help Him comfort You are all witnesses as I am of the truth of the inscription on the pin my mother wore for more than 20 years as a member of the Relief Society general board It read Charity Never Faileth 9 I still do not know the full meaning of those words But I have caught a glimpse as I saw her reach out to those in need The scripture tells us this truth Charity is the pure love of Christ 10His love never fails and we never will cease to feel in our hearts the urge to mourn with those that mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort 11 Nor will the peace He promises ever leave us as we serve others for Him As His witness I extend gratitude for what you do so well to help the living Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost the Comforter strengthen feeble knees and lift up hands that hang down 12 I am grateful with all my heart for the women in my life who have helped me and blessed me as true disciples of Jesus Christ In the name of Jesus Christ amen

My hope for us today is that we may all feel love and light from God There are many listening today who feel a pressing need for that blessing of personal revelation from our loving Heavenly Father For mission presidents it may be a pleading prayer to know how to encourage a struggling missionary For a father or a mother in a war ravaged place in the world it will be a desperate need to know whether to move their family to safety or whether to stay where they are Hundreds of stake presidents and bishops are praying today to know how to help the Lord rescue a lost sheep And for a prophet it will be to know what the Lord would have him speak to the Church and to a world in turmoil We all know that human judgment and logical thinking will not be enough to get answers to the questions that matter most in life We need revelation from God And we will need not just one revelation in a time of stress but we need a constantly renewed stream We need not just one flash of light and comfort but we need the continuing blessing of communication with God The very existence of the Church stems from a young boy knowing that was true Young Joseph Smith knew that he could not of himself know which church to join So he asked of God as the book of James told him he could God the Father and His Beloved Son appeared in a grove of trees They answered the question that was beyond Joseph s power to resolve Not only was he then called of God to establish the true Church of Jesus Christ but with it was restored the power to invoke the Holy Ghost so that revelation from God could be continuous President Boyd K Packer described that identifying mark of the true Church this way Revelation continues in the Church the prophet receiving it for the Church the president for his stake his mission or his quorum the bishop for his ward the father for his family the individual for himself 1That wonderful process of revelation begins ends and continues as we receive personal revelation Let s take the great Nephi son of Lehi as our example His father had a dream Others in Nephi s family viewed Lehi s dream as evidence of mental confusion The dream included a command from God for Lehi s sons to run the terrible risk of returning to Jerusalem for the plates which contained the word of God so that they could take them on their journey to the promised land We often quote Nephi s brave declaration when his father asked them to go back to Jerusalem You know the words I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded 2When Lehi heard Nephi speak those words the scripture says that he was exceedingly glad 3 He was glad because he knew that Nephi had been blessed with confirming revelation that his father s dream was a true communication from God Nephi did not say I will go and do what my father told me to do Rather he said I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded From your experience in your own families you also know why Lehi was exceedingly glad His joy came from knowing that Nephi had received confirming revelation Many parents have set family rules for when a teenage child is to return home at night But think of the joy when the parent learns as one did just a few weeks ago that a child who had recently left home not only set a curfew for herself but also kept the Sabbath just as she had been taught at home The revelation of a parent has its lasting effect in the personal revelation that continues in the child My mother must have understood that principle of revelation As a young man I would close the back door very quietly when I came home late in the evening I had to pass my mother s bedroom on the way to mine However quietly I tiptoed just as I got to her half opened door I would hear my name ever so quietly Hal come in for a moment I would go in and sit on the edge of her bed The room would be dark If you had listened you would have thought it was only friendly talk about life But to this day what she said comes back to my mind with the same power I feel when I read the transcript of my patriarchal blessing I don t know what she was asking for in prayer as she waited for me those nights I suppose it would have been in part for my safety But I am sure that she prayed as a patriarch does before he gives a blessing He prays that his words will come to the recipient as the words of God not his My mother s prayers for that blessing were answered on my head She is in the spirit world and has been for more than 40 years I am sure she has been exceedingly glad that I was blessed as she asked to hear in her counsel the commands of God And I have tried to go and do as she hoped I would I have seen that same miracle of continuing revelation in stake presidents and bishops in the Church And as is true in the revelation to family leaders the value of the revelation depends on those who are being led receiving confirming revelation I saw that miracle of revelation in the aftermath of the breaking of the Teton Dam in Idaho in 1976 Many of you know the story of what happened But the example of continuing revelation that was passed through a stake president could bless all of us in the days ahead Thousands of people were evacuated as their homes were destroyed Directing the relief efforts fell to a local stake president a farmer I was in a classroom at Ricks College just a few days after the disaster A leader from the federal disaster agency had arrived He and his chief assistants came to the large room where the stake president had assembled bishops and even some ministers of other local religions I was there because many of the survivors were being cared for and housed on the campus of the college where I was the president As the meeting began the representative from the federal disaster agency stood and began to say with the voice of authority what needed to be done After he listed each of the five or six tasks he said were essential the stake president responded quietly We ve already done that After a few minutes the man from the federal disaster agency said I think that I will just sit down and watch for a while He and his deputies then listened as bishops and elders quorum presidents reported what they had done They described what direction they had received and followed from their leaders They talked as well about what they had been inspired to do as they carried out the instructions to find families and to help them It was late that day They were all too tired to show much emotion except their love of the people The stake president gave a few final directions to the bishops and then he announced a time for the next report meeting early the following morning The next morning the leader of the federal team arrived 20 minutes before the report and assignment meeting was scheduled to begin I stood nearby I heard him say quietly to the stake president President what would you like me and the members of my team to do What that man saw I have seen in times of distress and testing all over the world President Packer was right Continuing revelation comes to stake presidents to lift them above their own wisdom and capacities And beyond that the Lord gives to those whom the president leads a confirming witness that his commands come from God through the Holy Ghost to an imperfect human being I have been blessed to be called to follow inspired leaders much of my life As a very young man I was called to be counselor to an elders quorum president I have in turn been counselor to two district presidents and to a Presiding Bishop of the Church a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and a counselor to two Presidents of the Church I have seen the revelation given to them and then confirmed to their followers That personal revelation of acceptance for which we all long does not come easily nor does it come simply for the asking The Lord gave this standard for the capacity to receive such witnesses from God It is a guide for anyone seeking personal revelation as we all must Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men and to the household of faith and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion 4From that I draw counsel for us all Don t take lightly the feeling you get of love for the prophet of God Wherever I go in the Church whoever the prophet is at the time members will ask When you get back to Church headquarters will you please tell the prophet how much we love him That is far more than hero worship or the feelings we sometimes have of admiring heroic figures It is a gift from God With it you will receive more easily the gift of confirming revelation when he speaks in his office as the Lord s prophet The love you feel is the love the Lord has for whoever is His spokesman That is not easy to feel continually because the Lord often asks His prophets to give counsel that is hard for people to accept The enemy of our souls will try to lead us to take offense and to doubt the prophet s calling from God I have seen how the Holy Ghost can touch a softened heart to protect a humble disciple of Jesus Christ with confirming revelation The prophet sent me to confer the sacred sealing power on a man in a small city far away Only the prophet of God has the keys to decide who is to receive the sacred power which was given by the Lord to Peter the senior Apostle I had received that same sealing power but only by direction of the President of the Church could I confer it on another So in a room in a chapel far from Salt Lake I laid my hands on the head of a man chosen by the prophet to receive the sealing power His hands showed the signs of a lifetime of tilling the soil for a meager living His tiny wife sat near him She also showed signs of years of hard labor alongside her husband I spoke the words given by the prophet Under delegation of authority and responsibility from and then the name of the prophet who holds all the keys of the priesthood on earth at this time I confer the sealing power on and I gave the name of the man and then the name of the temple where he would serve as a sealer Tears flowed down his cheeks I saw that his wife was also weeping I waited for them to compose themselves She stood up and stepped toward me She looked up and then said timidly that she was happy but also sad She said that she had so loved going to the temple with her husband but that now she felt that she should not go with him because God had chosen him for so glorious and sacred a trust Then she said that her feeling of being inadequate to be his temple companion came because she could neither read nor write I assured her that her husband would be honored by her company in the temple because of her great spiritual power As well as I could with my small grasp of her language I told her that God had revealed things to her beyond all earthly education She knew by the gift of the Spirit that God had given through His prophet a supernal trust to the husband she loved She knew for herself that the keys to give that sealing power were held by a man she had never seen and yet knew for herself was the living prophet of God She knew without having to be told by any living witness that the prophet had prayed over the name of her husband She knew for herself that God had made the call She also knew that the ordinances her husband would perform would bind people for eternity in the celestial kingdom She had confirmed to her mind and heart that the promise the Lord made to Peter still continued in the Church Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven 5 She knew that for herself by revelation from God Let us go back to our starting point Revelation continues in the Church the prophet receiving it for the Church the president for his stake his mission or his quorum the bishop for his ward the father for his family the individual for himself 6I bear you my witness that is true Heavenly Father hears your prayers He loves you He knows your name Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and our Redeemer He loves you beyond your ability to comprehend God pours out revelation through the Holy Ghost on His children He speaks to His prophet on the earth who today is Thomas S Monson I witness that he holds and exercises all the keys of the priesthood on earth As you listen in this conference to the words of those God has called to speak for Him I pray that you will receive the confirming revelation you need to find your way on the journey home again to dwell with Him in a sealed family forever In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be gathered with the priesthood of God which stretches across the world I appreciate your faith your service and your prayers My message tonight is about the Aaronic Priesthood It is also to all of us who help in the realization of the Lord s promises for those who hold what is described in scripture as the lesser priesthood 1 It is also called the preparatory priesthood It is that glorious preparation about which I will speak tonight The Lord s plan for His work is filled with preparation He prepared the earth for us to experience the tests and the opportunities of mortality While we are here we are in what the scriptures call a preparatory state 2The prophet Alma described the crucial importance of that preparation for eternal life where we may live forever in families with God the Father and Jesus Christ He explained the need for preparation this way And we see that death comes upon mankind yea the death which has been spoken of by Amulek which is the temporal death nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent therefore this life became a probationary state a time to prepare to meet God a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us which is after the resurrection of the dead 3Just as the time we have been given to live in mortality is to prepare to meet God the time we are given to serve in the Aaronic Priesthood is an opportunity to prepare us to learn how to give crucial help to others Just as the Lord gives the help we require to pass the tests of mortal life He also sends us help in our priesthood preparation My message is to those whom the Lord sends to help prepare Aaronic Priesthood holders as much as it is to those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood I speak to fathers I speak to bishops And I speak to those of the Melchizedek Priesthood who are trusted to be companions and teachers of young men who are in priesthood preparation I speak in praise and in gratitude for many of you across the world and across time I would be remiss if I did not speak of a branch president and a bishop of my youth I became a deacon at the age of 12 in a little branch in the eastern part of the United States The branch was so tiny that my older brother and I were its only Aaronic Priesthood holders until my father who was the branch president invited a middle aged man to join the Church The new convert received the Aaronic Priesthood and with it a call to watch over the Aaronic Priesthood I still remember as if it were yesterday I can recall the beautiful fall leaves as that new convert accompanied my brother and me to do something for a widow I don t remember what the project was but I do remember feeling that the priesthood power joined in doing what I later learned the Lord had said we must all do to have our sins forgiven and so be prepared to see Him As I look back now I feel gratitude for a branch president who called a new convert to help the Lord prepare two boys who would in turn someday be bishops charged to care for the poor and the needy and also to preside over the preparatory priesthood I was still a deacon when our family moved to a large ward in Utah It was the first time I had felt the power of a full quorum in the Aaronic Priesthood In fact it was the first time I saw one And later it was the first time I felt the power and the blessing of a bishop presiding in a priests quorum The bishop called me to be his first assistant in the priests quorum I remember that he taught the quorum himself busy as he was with other gifted men whom he could have called to teach us He had the chairs in the classroom arranged in a circle He had me sit in the chair next to him to his right I could look over his shoulder as he taught He looked down occasionally at the carefully typed notes in the little leather binder on one knee and at the well worn and marked scriptures he had open on the other knee I can remember the thrill as he recounted the stories of bravery from the book of Daniel and his testimony of the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ I will always remember how the Lord calls companions carefully chosen for his priesthood holders in preparation My bishop had powerful counselors and for reasons I did not understand then more than once he called me on the phone at home and said Hal I need you to go with me as a companion to make some visits Once it was to take me with him to the home of a widow living alone and without any food in the house On the way home he stopped his car opened his scriptures and told me why he had treated that widow as if she had the power not only to care for herself but would at some time in the future be able to help others Another visit was to a man long absent from the Church My bishop invited him back to be with the Saints I felt my bishop s love for someone who seemed to me an unlovable and rebellious enemy On yet another occasion we visited a home where two little girls were sent to meet us at the door by their alcoholic parents The little girls said through the screen door that their mother and father were asleep The bishop kept talking to them smiling and praising their goodness and their bravery for what seemed to me 10 minutes or more As I walked away at his side he said quietly That was a good visit Those little girls will never forget that we came Two of the blessings that a senior priesthood companion can give are trust and an example of caring I saw that when my son was given a home teaching companion who had vastly more priesthood experience than he did His senior companion had been a mission president twice and had served in other leadership positions Before they were to visit one of their assigned families that seasoned priesthood leader asked to visit my son in our home beforehand They allowed me to listen The senior companion opened with prayer asking for help Then he said something like this to my son I think we should teach a lesson that will sound to this family like a call to repentance I think they won t take it very well from me I think they would take the message better from you How do you feel about that I remember the terror in my son s eyes I can still feel the happiness of that moment when my son accepted the trust It was not by accident that the bishop put that companionship together It was by careful preparation that the senior companion had learned about the feelings of that family they were about to teach It was by inspiration that he felt to step back to trust an inexperienced youth to call older children of God to repentance and to safety I don t know the outcome of their visit but I do know that a bishop a Melchizedek Priesthood holder and the Lord were preparing a boy to be a priesthood man and someday a bishop Now such stories of success in priesthood preparation are familiar to you from what you have seen and what you have experienced in your own lives You have known and have been such bishops companions and parents You have seen the hand of the Lord in your preparation for the priesthood duties which He knew would lie ahead of you All of us in the priesthood have an obligation to help the Lord prepare others There are some things we can do that could matter most Even more powerful than using words in our teaching the doctrine will be our examples of living the doctrine Paramount in our priesthood service is inviting people to come unto Christ by faith repentance baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost President Thomas S Monson for instance has given sermons to stir the heart on all those doctrines But what I know of what he did with people and missionaries and friends of the Church when presiding over the mission in Toronto motivates me to action In priesthood preparation show me counts more than tell me That is why the scriptures are so important to prepare us in the priesthood They are filled with examples I feel as if I can see Alma following the angel s command and then hurrying back to teach the wicked people in Ammonihah who had rejected him 4 I can feel the cold in the jail cell when the Prophet Joseph was told by God to take courage and that he was watched over 5 With those scripture pictures in mind we can be prepared to endure in our service when it seems hard A father or a bishop or a senior home teaching companion who shows that he trusts a young priesthood holder can change his life My father was once asked by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to write a short paper on science and religion My father was a famous scientist and a faithful priesthood holder But I can still remember the moment he handed me the paper he had written and said Here before I send this to the Twelve I want you to read it You will know if it is right He was 32 years older than me and immeasurably more wise and intelligent I still am strengthened by that trust from a great father and priesthood man I knew that his trust was not in me but that God could and would tell me what was true You seasoned companions can bless a young priesthood holder in preparation whenever you can show him that kind of trust It will help him trust the gentle feeling of inspiration for himself when it comes as he someday places his hands to seal the blessing to heal a child the doctors say will die That trust has helped me more than once Our success in preparing others in the priesthood will come in proportion to how much we love them That will be especially true when we must correct them Think of the moment when an Aaronic Priesthood holder perhaps at the sacrament table makes a mistake in performing an ordinance That is a serious matter Sometimes the error requires public correction with a possibility of resentment a feeling of humiliation or even of being rejected You will remember the Lord s counsel Reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the Holy Ghost and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy 6The word increase has special meaning in preparing priesthood holders when they need correction The word suggests an increase of a love that was already there The showing forth is about the increase Those of you who are preparing priesthood holders will certainly see them make mistakes Before they receive your correction they must have felt of your love early and steadily They must have felt your genuine praise before they will accept your correction The Lord Himself held those of the lesser priesthood with a regard that honors their potential and their value to Him Listen to these words spoken by John the Baptist when the Aaronic Priesthood was restored Upon you my fellow servants in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron which holds the keys of the ministering of angels and of the gospel of repentance and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness 7The Aaronic Priesthood is an appendage to the greater Melchizedek Priesthood 8 As the president of all the priesthood the President of the Church presides over the preparatory priesthood as well His messages over the years of going to the rescue fit perfectly the mandate to take the gospel of repentance and baptism into the lives of others Quorums of deacons teachers and priests counsel regularly to draw every member of the quorum to the Lord Presidencies assign members to reach out in faith and love Deacons pass the sacrament with reverence and with faith that members will feel the effect of the Atonement and resolve to keep commandments as they partake of those sacred emblems Teachers and priests pray with their companions to fulfill the charge to watch over the Church person by person And those companionships pray together as they learn the needs and the hopes of heads of families As they do they are being prepared for the great day when they will preside as a father in faith in a family of their own I testify that all who serve together in the priesthood are preparing a people for the coming of the Lord to His Church God the Father lives I know I know that Jesus is the Christ and that He loves us President Thomas S Monson is the Lord s living prophet I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters some of you were invited to this meeting by missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Those missionaries may have already invited you to make the choice of covenanting with God by being baptized Others of you are listening because you accepted the invitation of a parent a wife or perhaps a child extended to you in the hopes that you will choose to put the covenants you have already made with God back into the center of your lives Some of you who are listening have already made the choice to return to follow the Savior and are feeling today the joy of His welcome Whoever you are and wherever you may be you hold in your hands the happiness of more people than you can now imagine Every day and every hour you can choose to make or keep a covenant with God Wherever you are on the path to inherit the gift of eternal life you have the opportunity to show many people the way to greater happiness When you choose whether to make or keep a covenant with God you choose whether you will leave an inheritance of hope to those who might follow your example You and I have been blessed with the promise of such an inheritance I owe much of my happiness in life to a man I never met in mortal life He was an orphan who became one of my great grandparents He left me a priceless heritage of hope Let me tell you some of the part he played in creating that inheritance for me His name was Heinrich Eyring He was born into great wealth His father Edward had a large estate in Coburg in what is now Germany His mother was Viscountess Charlotte Von Blomberg Her father was the keeper of the lands of the king of Prussia Heinrich was Charlotte and Edward s first son Charlotte died at the age of 31 after the birth of her third child Edward died soon thereafter having lost all his property and wealth in a failed investment He was only 40 years of age He left three orphaned children Heinrich my great grandfather had lost both of his parents and a great worldly inheritance He was penniless He recorded in his history that he felt his best hope lay in going to America Although he had neither family nor friends there he had a feeling of hope about going to America He first went to New York City Later he moved to St Louis Missouri In St Louis one of his co workers was a Latter day Saint From him he obtained a copy of a pamphlet written by Elder Parley P Pratt He read it and then studied every word he could obtain about the Latter day Saints He prayed to know if there really were angels that appeared to men whether there was a living prophet and whether he had found a true and revealed religion After two months of careful study and prayer Heinrich had a dream in which he was told he was to be baptized A man whose name and priesthood I hold in sacred memory Elder William Brown was to perform the ordinance Heinrich was baptized in a pool of rainwater on March 11 1855 at 7 30 in the morning I believe that Heinrich Eyring knew then that what I am teaching you today is true He knew that the happiness of eternal life comes through family bonds which continue forever Even when he had so recently found the Lord s plan of happiness he knew that his hope for eternal joy depended on the free choices of others to follow his example His hope of eternal happiness depended on people not yet born As a part of our family s inheritance of hope he left a history to his descendants In that history I can feel his love for those of us who would follow him In his words I feel his hope that his descendants might choose to follow him on the path back to our heavenly home He knew it would not be one great choice to make to do so but many small choices I quote from his history From the time I first heard Elder Andrus speak I have always attended the meeting of the Latter day Saints and the instances are very rare indeed when I have failed to go to meeting it being at the same time my duty to do so I name this in my history that my children may imitate my example and never neglect this important duty to assemble with the Saints 1Heinrich knew that in sacrament meetings we could renew our promise to always remember the Savior and have His Spirit to be with us It was that Spirit that sustained him on the mission to which he was called only a few months after accepting the baptismal covenant He left as his heritage his example of staying faithful to his mission for six years in what was then called the Indian Territories To receive his release from his mission he walked and joined a wagon train from Oklahoma to Salt Lake City a distance of approximately 1 100 miles 1 770 km Soon thereafter he was called by the prophet of God to move to southern Utah From there he answered another call to serve a mission in his native Germany He then accepted the invitation of an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ to help build up the Latter day Saint colonies in northern Mexico From there he was called to Mexico City as a full time missionary again He honored those calls He lies buried in a small cemetery in Colonia Ju rez Chihuahua Mexico I recite these facts not to claim greatness for him or for what he did or for his descendants I recite those facts to honor him for the example of faith and hope that was in his heart He accepted those calls because of his faith that the resurrected Christ and our Heavenly Father had appeared to Joseph Smith in a grove of trees in the state of New York He accepted them because he had faith that the priesthood keys in the Lord s Church had been restored with the power to seal families forever if only they had sufficient faith to keep their covenants Like Heinrich Eyring my ancestor you may be the first in your family to lead the way to eternal life along the path of sacred covenants made and kept with diligence and faith Each covenant brings with it duties and promises For all of us as they were for Heinrich those duties are sometimes simple but are often difficult But remember the duties must sometimes be difficult because their purpose is to move us along the path to live forever with Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ in families You remember the words from the book of Abraham And there stood one among them that was like unto God and he said unto those who were with him We will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell And we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever 2Keeping our second estate depends on our making covenants with God and faithfully performing the duties they require of us It takes faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior to keep sacred covenants for a lifetime Because Adam and Eve did fall we have temptation trials and death as our universal inheritance However our loving Heavenly Father gave us the gift of His Beloved Son Jesus Christ as our Savior That great gift and blessing of the Atonement of Jesus Christ brings a universal inheritance the promise of the Resurrection and the possibility of eternal life to all who are born The greatest of all the blessings of God eternal life will come to us only as we make covenants offered in the true Church of Jesus Christ by His authorized servants Because of the Fall we all need the cleansing effects of baptism and the laying on of hands to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost These ordinances must be performed by those who possess the proper priesthood authority Then with the help of the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost we can keep all the covenants we make with God especially those offered in His temples Only in that way and with that help can anyone claim his or her rightful inheritance as a child of God in a family forever To some listening to me that may seem a nearly hopeless dream You have seen faithful parents sorrow over children who have rejected or who have chosen to break their covenants with God But those parents can take heart and hope from other parental experiences Alma s son and King Mosiah s sons returned from fierce rebellion against the covenants and the commandments of God Alma the Younger saw his son Corianton turn from gross sin to faithful service The Book of Mormon also records the miracle of the Lamanites putting aside traditions of hating righteousness to covenanting to die to maintain peace An angel was sent to the young Alma and the sons of Mosiah The angel came because of the faith and prayers of their fathers and of God s people From those examples of the power of the Atonement working in human hearts you can receive courage and comfort The Lord has given us all the source of hope as we struggle to help those we love accept their eternal inheritance He has made promises to us as we keep trying to gather people to Him even when they resist His invitation to do so Their resistance saddens Him but He does not quit nor should we He sets the perfect example for us with His persistent love And again how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings yea O ye people of the house of Israel who have fallen yea O ye people of the house of Israel ye that dwell at Jerusalem as ye that have fallen yea how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens and ye would not 3We can depend on that unfailing desire of the Savior to bring all of Heavenly Father s spirit children back to their home with Him Every faithful parent grandparent and great grandparent shares in that desire Heavenly Father and the Savior are our perfect examples of what we can and must do They never force righteousness because righteousness must be chosen They make righteousness discernible to us and They let us see that its fruits are delicious Every person born into the world receives the Light of Christ which helps us see and feel what is right and what is wrong God has sent mortal servants who can by the Holy Ghost help us recognize what He would have us do and what He forbids God makes it attractive to choose the right by letting us feel the effects of our choices If we choose the right we will find happiness in time If we choose evil there comes sorrow and regret in time Those effects are sure Yet they are often delayed for a purpose If the blessings were immediate choosing the right would not build faith And since sorrow is also sometimes greatly delayed it takes faith to feel the need to seek forgiveness for sin early rather than after we feel its sorrowful and painful effects Father Lehi sorrowed over the choices made by some of his sons and their families He was a great and good man a prophet of God He often testified of our Savior Jesus Christ to them He was an example of obedience and service when the Lord called him to leave all his worldly possessions to spare his family from destruction At the very end of his life he was still testifying to his children Like the Savior and despite his power to discern their hearts and to see the future both sad and wonderful Lehi kept his arms outstretched to draw his family toward salvation Today millions of the descendants of Father Lehi are justifying his hope for them What can you and I do to draw from Lehi s example We can draw from his example by studying scripture prayerfully and by observation I suggest that you take both the short and the long view as you try to give the inheritance of hope to your family In the short run there will be troubles and Satan will roar And there are things to wait for patiently in faith knowing that the Lord acts in His own time and in His own way There are things you can do early when those you love are young Remember that daily family prayer family scripture study and sharing our testimony in sacrament meeting are easier and more effective when children are young Young children are often more sensitive to the Spirit than we realize When they are older they will remember the hymns they sang with you Even more than recalling music they will remember the words of scripture and testimony The Holy Ghost can bring all things to their remembrance but the words of scriptures and hymns will last the longest Those memories will exert a pull that may bring them back when they wander for a time possibly for years from the pathway home to eternal life We will need the long view when those we love feel the pull of the world and the cloud of doubt seems to overwhelm their faith We have faith hope and charity to guide us and to strengthen them I have seen that as a counselor to two living prophets of God They are individuals with unique personalities Yet they seem to share a consistent optimism When someone raises an alarm about something in the Church their most frequent response is Oh things will work out They generally know more about the problem than the people sounding the alarm They also know the way of the Lord and so they are always hopeful about His kingdom They know He is at its head He is all powerful and He cares If you let Him be the leader of your family things will work out Some of Heinrich Eyring s descendants have seemed to wander But many of his great great grandchildren go to temples of God at 6 00 in the morning to perform ordinances for ancestors they have never met They go out of the heritage of hope he left He left an inheritance that is being claimed by many of his descendants After all we can do in faith the Lord will justify our hopes for greater blessings for our families than we can imagine He wants the best for them and for us as His children We are all children of a living God Jesus of Nazareth is His Beloved Son and our resurrected Savior This is His Church In it are the keys of the priesthood and so families can be forever This is our priceless heritage of hope I testify that it is true in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
We have been taught with spiritual power tonight I pray that the words spoken by these great sister leaders will go down into your heart as they have into mine This is an historic meeting All the women of the Church eight years of age and older have been invited to join with us tonight Many of us have prayed that the Holy Ghost would be with us That blessing was granted as we heard these sisters speak and listened to the uplifting music I pray that the Spirit will continue to be with us as I offer some words of encouragement and testimony in addition to what has already been said and particularly to testify that what we have been told is what the Lord would have us hear I will speak tonight about the path which in such beautiful ways has been described today that we must take on our journey back to our Heavenly Father That path is marked by sacred covenants with God I will talk with you about the joy of making and keeping those covenants and helping others keep them A number of you were baptized recently and received the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands To you that memory is fresh Others were baptized long ago so the memory of your feelings of that covenant experience may be less clear but some of those feelings come back whenever you listen to the sacramental prayers No two of us will have the same memories of the day when we made that sacred baptismal covenant and received the gift of the Holy Ghost But we each felt God s approval And we felt a desire to forgive and to be forgiven and an increased determination to do right How deeply those feelings went down into your heart was determined largely by the way you were prepared by loving people I hope that those of you who came into the kingdom recently are blessed to be sitting near your mother If you are you might send her a smile of thanks right now I can remember the feeling of joy and gratitude as I sat behind my mother on the drive home from my baptism in Philadelphia Pennsylvania My mother was the one who had carefully prepared me for making that covenant and all the others that would follow She had been faithful to this charge from the Lord And again inasmuch as parents have children in Zion or in any of her stakes which are organized that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in Christ the Son of the living God and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands when eight years old the sin be upon the heads of the parents For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion or in any of her stakes which are organized And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when eight years old and receive the Holy Ghost 1My mother had done her part She had prepared her children with words much like those of Alma as recorded in the Book of Mormon And it came to pass that he said unto them Behold here are the waters of Mormon for thus were they called and now as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God and to be called his people and are willing to bear one another s burdens that they may be light Yea and are willing to mourn with those that mourn yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places that ye may be in even until death that ye may be redeemed of God and be numbered with those of the first resurrection that ye may have eternal life Now I say unto you if this be the desire of your hearts what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him that ye will serve him and keep his commandments that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you And now when the people had heard these words they clapped their hands for joy and exclaimed This is the desire of our hearts 2You may not have clapped your hands when you first heard that invitation to covenant by baptism but you surely felt the love of the Savior and a greater commitment to nurture others for Him I can say surely because those feelings are placed deep in the hearts of all of Heavenly Father s daughters That is part of your divine heritage from Him You were tutored by Him before you came into this life He helped you understand and accept that you would have trials tests and opportunities perfectly chosen just for you You learned that our Father had a plan of happiness to get you safely through those trials and that you would help bring others safely through theirs This plan is marked by covenants with God It is our free choice whether we make and keep those covenants Only a few of His daughters have the opportunity in this life to even learn of those covenants You are one of the favored few You dear sisters each of you is a daughter in the covenant Heavenly Father taught you before you were born about the experiences you would have as you left Him and came to earth You were taught that the way back home to Him would not be easy He knew that it would be too hard for you to make the journey without help You have been blessed not only to find the way to make those covenants in this life but also to be surrounded by others who will help who like you are covenant daughters of Heavenly Father You all have felt the blessing of being in the company tonight of daughters of God who are also under covenant to help and direct you as they promised to do I have seen what you have seen as covenant sisters keep that commitment to comfort and help and do it with a smile I remember the smile of Sister Ruby Haight She was the wife of Elder David B Haight who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles As a young man he served as the president of the Palo Alto stake in California He prayed over and worried about the girls in the Mia Maid class in his own ward So President Haight was inspired to ask the bishop to call Ruby Haight to teach those young girls He knew she would be a witness of God who would lift comfort and love the girls in that class Sister Haight was at least 30 years older than the girls she taught Yet 40 years after she taught them each time she would meet my wife who had been one of the girls in her class she would put out her hand smile and say to Kathy Oh My Mia Maid I saw more than her smile I felt her deep love for a sister she still cared for as if she were her own daughter Her smile and warm greeting came from seeing that a sister and daughter of God was still on the covenant path home Heavenly Father smiles on you as well whenever He sees you help a daughter of His move along the covenant path toward eternal life And He is pleased every time you try to choose the right He sees not only what you are but also what you may become You may have had an earthly parent who thought that you could be better than you thought you could be I had such a mother What I didn t know when I was young was that my Heavenly Father your Heavenly Father sees greater potential in His children than we or even our earthly mothers see in us And whenever you move upward on that path toward your potential it brings Him happiness And you can feel His approval He sees that glorious potential in all of His daughters wherever they are Now that puts a great responsibility on each of you He expects you to treat every person you meet as a child of God That is the reason He commands us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves and to forgive them Your feelings of kindness and forgiveness toward others come as your divine inheritance from Him as His daughter Each person you meet is His loved spiritual child As you feel of that great sisterhood what we thought divides us falls away For instance younger and older sisters share their feelings with the expectation of being understood and accepted You are more alike as daughters of God than you are different With that view young women should look forward to their entry into Relief Society as an opportunity to enlarge their circle of sisters whom they will come to know admire and love That same capacity to see what we can be is increasing in families and in Primary It is happening in family home evenings and in Primary programs Little children are being inspired to say great and marvelous things as they did when the Savior loosed their tongues when He taught them after He was resurrected 3While Satan may be attacking sisters at earlier ages the Lord is lifting sisters to higher and higher levels of spirituality For example young women are teaching their mothers how to use FamilySearch to find and save ancestors Some young sisters that I know are choosing to go early in the morning to perform proxy baptisms in temples without any urging beyond the spirit of Elijah In missions across the earth sisters are being called to serve as leaders The Lord created the need for their service by touching the hearts of sisters in greater numbers to serve More than a few mission presidents have seen the sister missionaries become ever more powerful as proselyters and particularly as nurturing leaders Whether or not you serve as a full time missionary you can gain the same ability to enrich your marriage and the capacity to raise noble children by following the examples of great women Consider Eve the mother of all living Elder Russell M Nelson said this of Eve We and all mankind are forever blessed because of Eve s great courage and wisdom By partaking of the fruit first she did what needed to be done Adam was wise enough to do likewise 4Every daughter of Eve has the potential to bring the same blessing to her family that Eve brought to hers She was so important in the establishment of families that we have this report of her creation And the Gods said Let us make an help meet for the man for it is not good that the man should be alone therefore we will form an help meet for him 5We don t know all the help Eve was to Adam and to their family But we do know of one great gift that she gave which each of you can also give she helped her family see the path home when the way ahead seemed hard And Eve his wife heard all these things and was glad saying Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed and never should have known good and evil and the joy of our redemption and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient 6You have her example to follow By revelation Eve recognized the way home to God She knew that the Atonement of Jesus Christ made eternal life possible in families She was sure as you can be that as she kept her covenants with her Heavenly Father the Redeemer and the Holy Ghost would see her and her family through whatever sorrows and disappointments would come She knew she could trust in Them Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding In all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths 7I know that Eve faced sorrows and disappointments but I also know that she found joy in the knowledge that she and her family could return to live with God I know that many of you who are here face sorrows and disappointments I leave you my blessing that like Eve you may feel the same joy that she felt as you journey back home I have a sure witness that God the Father watches over you in love He loves each of you You are His daughters in the covenant Because He loves you He will provide the help that you need to move yourself and others upward along the way back to His presence I know that the Savior paid the price of all of our sins and that the Holy Ghost testifies of truth You have felt that comfort in this meeting I have a testimony that all the keys which bind sacred covenants have been restored They are held and exercised today by our living prophet President Thomas S Monson I leave these words of comfort and hope with you His beloved covenant daughters in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
We all have heroes particularly when we are young I was born and grew up in Princeton New Jersey in the United States The most famous sports teams near where we lived were headquartered in New York City It was the home of three professional baseball teams in those faraway days the Brooklyn Dodgers the New York Giants and the New York Yankees Philadelphia was even closer to our home and was the home of the Athletics and the Phillies baseball teams There were many potential baseball heroes for me on those teams Joe DiMaggio who played for the New York Yankees became my baseball hero When my brothers and my friends played baseball on the school grounds next to our house I tried to swing the bat the way I thought Joe DiMaggio did it That was before the days of television this is ancient history so I only had pictures from newspapers to use to copy his swing When I was growing up my father drove me to Yankee Stadium That was the only time I saw Joe DiMaggio play As if I am still there in my mind I can see him swing the bat and see the white baseball fly straight into the stands at center field Now my baseball skills never came close to those of my childhood hero But the few times I hit a baseball well I copied the level of his powerful swing as closely as I could When we choose heroes we begin to copy consciously or unconsciously what we admire most in them Happily my wise parents put great heroes in my path as a boy My dad took me to Yankee Stadium only once to observe my baseball hero play but every Sunday he let me observe a priesthood man who became a hero That hero shaped my life My father was the branch president of the little branch which met in our home By the way if you came down to the first floor on Sunday morning you were in church Our branch never had more than 30 people in attendance There was a young man who drove his mother to our house for meetings but he never came into the house He was not a member It was my father who succeeded by going out to him where he parked the car and inviting him into our home He was baptized and became my first and only Aaronic Priesthood leader He became my priesthood hero I still remember the wooden statue he gave me as a reward after we had completed a project to cut firewood for a widow I have tried to be like him whenever I give justified praise to a servant of God I chose another hero in that little branch of the Church He was a United States Marine who came to our meetings wearing his green marine uniform It was wartime so that alone made him my hero He had been sent to Princeton University by the marines to further his education But far more than admiring his military uniform I watched him play in Palmer Stadium as captain of the Princeton University football team I saw him play on the university basketball team and also watched him play as the star catcher on their baseball team But even more he came to my home during the week to show me how to shoot a basketball with both my left and my right hand He told me that I would need that skill because I would someday play basketball on good teams I did not realize it then but for years he was for me a model of a true priesthood man Each of you will be a model of a priesthood man whether you want to be or not You became a lighted candle when you accepted the priesthood The Lord put you on the candlestick to light the way for everyone who surrounds you That is especially true for those in your priesthood quorum You can be a great model an average one or a bad model You may think it doesn t matter to you but it does to the Lord He said it this way Ye are the light of the world A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven 1I have been blessed by examples of great priesthood holders in quorums where I was fortunate to serve You can do what they have done for me by being an example for others to follow I have observed three common characteristics of the priesthood holders who are my heroes One is a pattern of prayer the second is a habit of service and the third is a rock hard decision to be honest We all pray but the priesthood holder you want to be prays often and with real intent In the evening you will get on your knees and thank God for the blessings of the day You will thank Him for parents for teachers and for great examples to follow You will describe in your prayers specifically who has blessed your life and how during that day That will take more than a few minutes and more than a little thought It will surprise you and change you As you pray for forgiveness you will find yourself forgiving others As you thank God for His kindness you will think of others by name who need your kindness Again that experience will surprise you every day and over time it will change you One way you will be changed by such fervent prayer is I promise you that you will feel truly that you are a child of God When you know that you are a child of God you will also know that He expects much of you Because you are His child He will expect you to follow His teachings and the teachings of His dear Son Jesus Christ He will expect you to be generous and kind to others He will be disappointed if you are proud and self centered He will bless you to have the desire to put the interests of others above your own Some of you are already models of unselfish priesthood service In temples across the world priesthood holders arrive before sunrise And some serve long after sunset There is no recognition or public acclaim in this world for that sacrifice of time and effort I have gone with young people as they serve those in the spirit world who are not able to claim temple blessings for themselves As I see happiness rather than fatigue in the faces of those who serve there early and late I know there are great rewards in this life for that type of unselfish priesthood service but it is only a token of the joy they will share with those whom they served in the spirit world I have seen that same happiness in the faces of those who speak to others about the blessings which come from belonging to the kingdom of God I know of a branch president who almost every day brings people to the missionaries for them to teach Just a few months ago he was not yet a member of the Church Now there are missionaries teaching and a branch growing in numbers and strength because of him But more than that he is a light to others who will open their mouths and so hasten the Lord s gathering of the children of Heavenly Father As you pray and serve others your knowledge that you are a child of God and your feelings about Him will grow You will become more aware that He is saddened if you are dishonest in any way You will be more determined to keep your word to God and to others You will be more aware of taking anything that does not belong to you You will be more honest with your employers You will be more determined to be on time and to complete every task you are given by the Lord that you have accepted to do Rather than wondering if their home teachers will come children in the families you are called to teach will look forward with anticipation to your visit My children have received that blessing As they grew they had priesthood heroes help them set their own courses in serving the Lord That blessed example is now passing into the third generation My message is also one of thanks I thank you for your prayers I thank you for getting on your knees in recognition of the fact that you don t have all the answers You pray to the God of heaven to express your gratitude and to invoke His blessings upon your lives and your families I thank you for your service to others and for the times you felt no need for acknowledgment of your service We have accepted the Lord s warning that if we seek credit in this world for our service we may forfeit greater blessings You will remember these words Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven Therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men Verily I say unto you They have their reward But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth That thine alms may be in secret and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly 2Those who have been my models of great priesthood holders do not easily recognize that they possess heroic qualities In fact they seem to have difficulty seeing those things that I so much admire in them I mentioned my father was a faithful president of a tiny branch of the Church in New Jersey He later was a member of the Sunday School general board for the Church Yet I am careful today to speak modestly about his priesthood service because he was modest The same is true for the marine who was my childhood hero He never spoke to me of his priesthood service or of his accomplishments He just gave service I learned about his faithfulness from others If he even saw the characteristics in himself that I admired I could not tell So my counsel to you who want to bless others with your priesthood has to do with your life which is private to all but God Pray to Him Thank Him for all that is good in your life Ask Him to know what individuals He has placed in your way for you to serve Plead that He will help you give that service Pray so that you can forgive and so that you can be forgiven Then serve them love them and forgive them Above all remember that of all the service you give none is greater than to help people choose to qualify for eternal life God has given that overarching direction to us on how to use our priesthood He is the perfect example of it This is the example we see in small part in the best of His mortal servants And the Lord God spake unto Moses saying The heavens they are many and they cannot be numbered unto man but they are numbered unto me for they are mine And as one earth shall pass away and the heavens thereof even so shall another come and there is no end to my works neither to my words For behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 3We are to help in that work Each of us can make a difference We have been prepared for our time and place in the last days of that sacred work Each of us has been blessed with examples of those who have made that work the overriding purpose of their time on earth I pray that we may help each other rise to that opportunity God the Father lives and will answer your prayers for the help you need to serve Him well Jesus Christ is the risen Lord This is His Church The priesthood you hold is the power to act in His name in His work to serve the children of God As you give your whole heart to this work He will magnify you I so promise in the name of Jesus Christ our Savior amen

This year our first two grandchildren will be married Within a few years as many as 10 of their cousins are likely to reach a point in their lives where they will follow into the wonderful world of family creation That happy prospect has caused me deep contemplation as they have asked me for advice Essentially they have asked What choices could I make that will lead me to happiness And on the other hand What choices are likely to lead me to unhappiness Heavenly Father has made each of us unique No two of us have exactly the same experiences No two families are alike So it is not surprising that advice about how to choose happiness in family life is hard to give Yet a loving Heavenly Father has set the same path to happiness for all of His children Whatever our personal characteristics or whatever will be our experiences there is but one plan of happiness That plan is to follow all the commandments of God For all of us including my grandchildren contemplating marriage there is one overarching commandment that will help us to meet the challenges and lead to the heart of a happy family life It applies to all relationships regardless of circumstances It is repeated throughout the scriptures and in the teachings of the prophets in our day Here is the Bible wording of the Lord s advice to all who want to live together forever in loving happiness Then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind This is the first and great commandment And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets 1From that simple statement it is not hard to summarize all I have learned about what choices lead to happiness in families I start with the question What choices have led me toward loving the Lord with all my heart and soul and with all my mind For me it has been to choose to put myself where I felt the joy of forgiveness through the Lord s Atonement Years ago I baptized a young man in Albuquerque New Mexico whom my missionary companion and I had taught I put the young man down into the water and brought him up He must have been nearly as tall as me because he spoke directly into my ear With water from the font and tears running down his face and with joy in his voice he said I m clean I m clean I have seen those same tears of happiness in the eyes of someone who recounted the words of an Apostle of God He had said to her after a searching and tender interview I forgive you in the name of the Lord He will give you the assurance of His forgiveness in His own time and in His own way And He did I have seen why the Lord can say that when sins are forgiven He can remember them no more By the power of the Atonement people I know well and love became new and the effects of sin were wiped away My heart has been filled with love for the Savior and the loving Father who sent Him That great blessing has come by encouraging people I care for to go to the Savior for relief from pain a relief only He can give That is why I urge those I love to accept and to magnify every calling offered them in the Church That choice is one of the great keys to family happiness The pressures at every stage of life can tempt us to reject or neglect calls to serve the Savior That can put us in spiritual peril for ourselves our spouse and our families Some of those calls may seem unimportant but my life and my family was changed for the better by my accepting a call to teach a deacons quorum I felt the love of those deacons for the Savior and His love for them I have seen that happen in the life of a former stake and mission president in his call to him to advise a teachers quorum I know of another who has been a bishop and then an Area Seventy who was used by the Lord to succor a boy in a teachers quorum who was hurt in an accident The miracles from that service touched many lives including mine and increased their love for the Savior While serving others we are most likely to plead for the companionship of the Holy Ghost Success in the Lord s service always produces miracles beyond our own powers The parent facing a child in serious rebellion knows that is true as does the visiting teacher approached by a woman seeking comfort when her husband told her he was leaving her Both servants are grateful they prayed that morning for the Lord to send the Holy Ghost as a companion It is only with the companionship of the Holy Ghost that we can hope to be equally yoked in a marriage free from discord I have seen how that companionship is crucial for felicity in a marriage The miracle of becoming one requires the help of heaven and it takes time Our goal is to live together forever in the presence of Heavenly Father and our Savior My father and my mother were very different from each other My mother was a singer and an artist My father loved chemistry Once at a symphony concert my mother was surprised when my father stood up and began to leave before the applause began My mother asked him where he was going His response was in all innocence Well it s over isn t it Only the gentle influence of the Holy Ghost got him there with her in the first place and brought him back to concerts time and time again My mother lived in New Jersey for 16 years so that my father could support the family by doing research and teaching chemistry To her it was a sacrifice being separated from her widowed mother and her unmarried sister who had cared for her in the old family farmhouse They both died while Mother was far away in New Jersey Those were the only times I ever saw my mother cry Years later my father was offered a job in Utah He asked my mother again in all innocence Mildred what do you think I should do She said Henry do whatever you think is best He turned down the offer The next morning she wrote him a letter that I wish I still had I remember that she told him Don t open it here Go to the office and open it there It began with a rebuke He had promised her years before that if he ever could he would take her to be near her family He was surprised by her expression of irritation He had not remembered the desire of her heart He immediately sent a message accepting the job offer He said Mildred why didn t you tell me She said You were supposed to remember He always spoke of that choice to move to Utah as his own never as a sacrifice of his professional career They had received the miracle of becoming one It would have been better if Dad had been reminded by the Holy Ghost of the promise he had made years earlier But he did allow the Holy Ghost to soften his heart so that her choice became his Heavenly Father has perfect foresight knows each of us and knows our future He knows what difficulties we will pass through He sent His Son to suffer so that He would know how to succor us in all our trials We know that Heavenly Father has spirit children in this world who sometimes choose sin and great unhappiness That is why He sent His Firstborn to be our Redeemer the greatest act of love in all creation That is why we must expect that it will take the help of God and time to polish us for eternal life to live with our Father Life in families will test us That is one of God s purposes in giving us the gift of mortality to strengthen us by passing through tests That will be especially true in family life where we will find great joy and great sorrow and challenges which may at times seem beyond our power to endure them President George Q Cannon said this about how God has prepared you and me and our children for the tests we will face There is not one of us but what God s love has been expended upon There is not one of us that He has not cared for and caressed There is not one of us that He has not desired to save and that He has not devised means to save There is not one of us that He has not given His angels charge concerning We may be insignificant and contemptible in our own eyes and in the eyes of others but the truth remains that we are the children of God and that He has actually given His angels invisible beings of power and might charge concerning us and they watch over us and have us in their keeping 2What President Cannon taught is true You will need that assurance as I have needed it and depended on it I have prayed with faith that someone I loved would seek and feel the power of the Atonement I have prayed with faith that human angels would come to their aid and they came God has devised means to save each of His children For many that involves being placed with a brother or a sister or a grandparent who loves them no matter what they do Years ago a friend of mine spoke of his grandmother She had lived a full life always faithful to the Lord and to His Church Yet one of her grandsons chose a life of crime He was finally sentenced to prison My friend recalled that his grandmother as she drove along a highway to visit her grandson in prison had tears in her eyes as she prayed with anguish I ve tried to live a good life Why why do I have this tragedy of a grandson who seems to have destroyed his life The answer came to her mind in these words I gave him to you because I knew you could and would love him no matter what he did There is a wonderful lesson for us all The way for loving parents and grandparents and all of God s servants will not be easy in a decaying world We cannot force God s children to choose the way to happiness God cannot do that because of the agency He has given us Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son love all of God s children no matter what they choose to do or what they become The Savior paid the price of all sins no matter how heinous Even though there must be justice the opportunity for mercy is extended which will not rob justice Alma expressed that hope to his son Corianton in these words Therefore according to justice the plan of redemption could not be brought about only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state yea this preparatory state for except it were for these conditions mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice Now the work of justice could not be destroyed if so God would cease to be God 3My message then to my grandchildren and to all of us trying to forge eternal families is that there is joy guaranteed for the faithful From before the world was a loving Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son loved and worked with those who They knew would wander God will love them forever You have the advantage of knowing that they learned the plan of salvation from the teachings they received in the spirit world They and you were faithful enough to be allowed to come into the world when many others were not With the help of the Holy Ghost all truths will be brought to our remembrance We cannot force that on others but we can let them see it in our lives We can always take courage from the assurance that we all once felt the joy of being together as a member of the beloved family of our Heavenly Father With God s help we can all feel that hope and that joy again I pray that may be so for all of us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
All of us are blessed with responsibility for others To hold the priesthood of God is to be held responsible by God for the eternal lives of His children That is real that is wonderful and at times that can feel overwhelming There are elders quorum presidents listening tonight who know what I mean Here is what happened to one of you It has likely happened to many of you and more than once The details may vary but the situation is the same An elder you do not know well asked for your help He had just found out that he had to move his wife and young baby boy today from the apartment where they have been living to another one nearby He and his wife had already asked a friend if they could borrow a truck for the day to move their household and personal belongings The friend loaned them the truck The young father began to load all they owned into the truck but in the first few minutes he hurt his back The friend who loaned the truck was too busy to help The young father felt desperate He thought of you his elders quorum president By the time he asked for help it was early afternoon It was the day of an evening Church meeting You had already promised to help your wife with household projects that day Your children had asked you to do something with them but you hadn t gotten to it yet You also knew that the members of your quorum particularly the most faithful the ones you usually called on to help were likely to be in the same time bind that you were in The Lord knew you would have such days when He called you to this position so He gave you a story to encourage you It is a parable for overloaded priesthood holders We sometimes call it the story of the good Samaritan But it is really the story for a great priesthood bearer in these busy difficult last days The story is a perfect fit for the overtaxed priesthood servant Just remember that you are the Samaritan and not the priest or the Levite who passed by the wounded man You may not have thought of that story when you faced such challenges But I pray you will when such days come again as they surely will We are not told in the scriptures why the Samaritan was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho It is not likely that he was taking a stroll alone since he must have known that robbers waited for the unwary He was on a serious journey and as was customary he had with him a beast of burden as well as oil and wine In the Lord s words the Samaritan when he saw the wounded man stopped because he had compassion More than only feeling compassion he acted Always remember the specifics of the account And he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him And on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him Take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee 1You and the priesthood bearers you are called to lead can have at least three assurances First the Lord will give you if you ask the feelings of compassion He feels for those in need Second He will provide others like the innkeeper to join with you in your service And third the Lord like the good Samaritan will more than recompense all who join in giving help to those in need You quorum presidents likely have acted on those assurances more than once You asked others of the Lord s priesthood to help with confidence that they would respond with compassion You were not afraid to ask those who have responded most often in the past because you knew that they feel compassion easily You asked them knowing that in the past they have felt the Lord s generosity when they chose to help You asked some already heavily burdened knowing that the greater the sacrifice the greater the compensation they will receive from the Lord Those who have helped in the past have felt the overflowing gratitude of the Savior You may well have been inspired not to ask someone to help load and then unload that truck As a leader you know your quorum members and their families well The Lord knows them perfectly He knows whose wife was near the breaking point because her husband was unable to find time to do what she needed done to care for her needs He knows which children would be blessed by seeing their father go one more time to help others or if the children needed the feeling that they matter to their father enough for him to spend time with them that day But He also knows who needs the invitation to serve but might not appear to be a likely or willing candidate You cannot know all your quorum members perfectly well but God does So as you have done so many times you prayed to know whom to ask to help serve others The Lord knows who will be blessed by being asked to help and whose family will be blessed by not being asked That is the revelation you can expect to come to you as you lead in the priesthood I saw that happen when I was a young man I was the first assistant in a priests quorum The bishop called me one day at my home He said that he wanted me to go with him to visit a widow in great need He said he needed me As I waited for him to pick me up at my home I was troubled I knew the bishop had strong and wise counselors One was a famous judge The other ran a large company and would later become a General Authority The bishop himself would someday serve as a General Authority Why was the bishop saying to an inexperienced priest I need your help Well I know better now what he might have said to me The Lord needs to bless you At the home of the widow I saw him to my amazement tell the woman that she could get no help from the Church until she filled out the budget form he had left with her earlier On the way home as he saw how shocked I was he chuckled at my surprise and said Hal when she gets control of her spending she will be able to help others On another occasion my bishop took me with him to the home of alcoholic parents who sent two frightened little girls to meet us at the door After he visited with the two little girls we turned away and he said to me We can t change the tragedy in their lives yet but they can feel that the Lord loves them On another evening he took me to the home of a man who hadn t come to church in years The bishop told him how much he loved him and how much the ward needed him It didn t seem to have much effect on the man But that time and every time the bishop took me with him it had a great effect on me There is no way that I can find out whether the bishop prayed to know which priest would be blessed by going with him on those visits He may well have taken other priests with him many times But the Lord knew I would someday be a bishop inviting those whose faith had grown cold to come back to the warmth of the gospel The Lord knew I would someday be charged with the priesthood responsibility for hundreds and even thousands of Heavenly Father s children who were in desperate temporal need You young men cannot know what acts of priesthood service the Lord is preparing you to give But the greater challenge for every priesthood holder is to give spiritual help All of us have that charge It comes with being a member of a quorum It comes with being a member of a family If the faith of anyone in your quorum or your family is attacked by Satan you will feel compassion Much like the service and mercy given by the Samaritan you will also minister to them with healing balm for their wounds in their time of need In your service as a full time missionary you will go to thousands of people in great spiritual need Many until you teach them will not even know that they have spiritual wounds that left untreated will bring endless misery You will go on the Lord s errand to rescue them Only the Lord can bind up their spiritual wounds as they accept the ordinances that lead to eternal life As a quorum member as a home teacher and as a missionary you cannot help people repair spiritual damage unless your own faith is vibrant That means far more than reading the scriptures regularly and praying over them The prayer in the moment and quick glances in the scriptures are not preparation enough The reassurance of what you will need comes with this counsel from the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man 2That promise can be claimed only if we treasure up the words of life and do it continually The treasuring part of that scripture has meant for me a matter of feeling something about the words For instance when I have gone to try to help someone wavering in his or her faith about the Prophet Joseph Smith s divine calling feelings come back to me It is not only the words from the Book of Mormon It is a feeling of assurance of truth that comes whenever I read even a few lines from the Book of Mormon I cannot promise that it will come to every person infected with doubt about the Prophet Joseph or the Book of Mormon But I know Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration I know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God because I have treasured it I know from experience that you can get the assurance of truth from the Spirit because it has come to me You and I must have that assurance before the Lord puts us in the way of a traveler we love who has been wounded by the enemies of truth There is another preparation we must make It is a human characteristic to become hardened to the pains of others That is one of the reasons why the Savior went to such lengths to tell of His Atonement and of His taking upon Himself the pains and sorrows of all of our Heavenly Father s children that He might know how to succor them Even the best of Heavenly Father s mortal priesthood holders do not rise to that standard of compassion easily Our human tendency is to be impatient with the person who cannot see the truth that is so plain to us We must be careful that our impatience is not interpreted as condemnation or rejection As we prepare to give succor for the Lord as His priesthood servants there is a scripture to guide us It contains a gift we will need for our journey wherever the Lord will send us The good Samaritan had that gift We will need it and the Lord has told us how we can find it Wherefore my beloved brethren if ye have not charity ye are nothing for charity never faileth Wherefore cleave unto charity which is the greatest of all for all things must fail But charity is the pure love of Christ and it endureth forever and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day it shall be well with him Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure 3I pray that we may prepare ourselves to give whatever priesthood service the Lord may set before us on our mortal journey In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be with you in this conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints This is His Church We take His name upon us as we enter His kingdom He is God the Creator and perfect We are mortals subject to death and sin Yet in His love for us and our families He invites us to be close to Him Here are His words Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you seek me diligently and ye shall find me ask and ye shall receive knock and it shall be opened unto you 1At this Easter season we are reminded of why we love Him and of the promise He makes to His faithful disciples to become His beloved friends The Savior made that promise and told us how in our service to Him He comes to us One example is in a revelation to Oliver Cowdery as he served the Lord with the Prophet Joseph Smith in the translation of the Book of Mormon Behold thou art Oliver and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires therefore treasure up these words in thy heart Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love 2I experienced the joy of coming closer to the Savior and of His coming closer to me most often through simple acts of obedience to the commandments You have had such experiences It may have been when you chose to attend a sacrament meeting It was for me on a Sabbath when I was very young In those days we received the sacrament during an evening meeting The memory of one day more than 65 years ago when I kept the commandment to gather with my family and with the Saints still draws me closer to the Savior It was dark and cold outside I remember feeling light and warmth in the chapel that evening with my parents We partook of the sacrament administered by Aaronic Priesthood holders covenanting with our Heavenly Father to always remember His Son and keep His commandments At the end of the meeting we sang the hymn Abide with Me Tis Eventide with the words in it O Savior stay this night with me 3I felt the Savior s love and closeness that evening And I felt the comfort of the Holy Ghost I wanted to rekindle once again the feelings of the love of the Savior and His closeness I felt during that sacrament meeting in my youth So recently I kept another commandment I searched in the scriptures In them I knew I could go back again to have the Holy Ghost let me feel what two disciples of the risen Lord had felt when He accepted their invitation to come into their home and to abide with them I read of the third day after His Crucifixion and burial Faithful women and others found the stone rolled away from the tomb and saw that His body was not there They had come out of love for Him to anoint His body Two angels stood by and asked why they were afraid saying Why seek ye the living among the dead He is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee Saying The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again 4The Gospel of Mark adds the direction from one of the angels But go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you 5The Apostles and disciples had gathered in Jerusalem As we might have been they were afraid and wondered as they spoke together about what death and reports of His being resurrected meant for them Two of the disciples walked that afternoon from Jerusalem on the road to Emmaus The resurrected Christ appeared on the road and walked with them The Lord had come to them The book of Luke allows us to walk with them And it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and went with them But their eyes were holden that they should not know him And he said unto them What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad And the one of them whose name was Cleopas answering said unto him Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days 6They told Him of their sadness that Jesus had died when they had trusted He would be the Redeemer of Israel There must have been affection in the risen Lord s voice as He spoke to these two sorrowful and mourning disciples Then he said unto them O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory And beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself 7Then came a moment that has warmed my heart since I was a little boy And they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further But they constrained him saying Abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent And he went in to tarry with them 8The Savior accepted that night the invitation to enter the house of His disciples near the village of Emmaus He sat at meat with them He took bread blessed it broke it and gave it to them Their eyes were opened so that they knew Him Then He vanished out of their sight Luke recorded for us the feelings of those blessed disciples And they said one to another Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures 9At that same hour the two disciples rushed back to Jerusalem to tell the eleven Apostles what had happened to them In that moment the Savior appeared again He reviewed the prophecies of His mission to atone for the sins of all His Father s children and to break the bands of death And said unto them Thus it is written and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem And ye are witnesses of these things 10The Savior s words are true as well for us as they were for His disciples then We are witnesses of these things And the glorious charge we accepted as we were baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints was made plain for us by the prophet Alma centuries ago at the waters of Mormon And it came to pass that he said unto them Behold here are the waters of Mormon for thus were they called and now as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God and to be called his people and are willing to bear one another s burdens that they may be light Yea and are willing to mourn with those that mourn yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places that ye may be in even until death that ye may be redeemed of God and be numbered with those of the first resurrection that ye may have eternal life Now I say unto you if this be the desire of your hearts what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him that ye will serve him and keep his commandments that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you And now when the people had heard these words they clapped their hands for joy and exclaimed This is the desire of our hearts 11We are under covenant both to lift up those in need and to be witnesses of the Savior as long as we live We will be able to do it without fail only as we feel love for the Savior and His love for us As we are faithful to the promises we have made we will feel our love for Him It will increase because we will feel His power and His drawing near to us in His service President Thomas S Monson has reminded us often of the promise of the Lord to His faithful disciples And whoso receiveth you there I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 12There is another way you and I have felt Him grow closer to us As we give devoted service to Him He draws closer to those we love in our families Every time I have been called in the Lord s service to move or to leave my family I have come to see that the Lord was blessing my wife and my children He prepared loving servants of His and opportunities to draw my family closer to Him You have felt that same blessing in your lives Many of you have loved ones who are wandering off the path to eternal life You wonder what more you can do to bring them back You can depend on the Lord to draw closer to them as you serve Him in faith You remember the Lord s promise to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon when they were away from their families on His errands My friends Sidney and Joseph your families are well they are in mine hands and I will do with them as seemeth me good for in me there is all power 13Like Alma and King Mosiah some faithful parents have served the Lord long and well yet have had children who wandered despite their parents sacrifice for the Lord They have done all they could to no apparent avail even with help from loving and faithful friends Alma and the Saints of his day prayed for his son and the sons of King Mosiah An angel came Your prayers and the prayers of those who exercise their faith will bring the Lord s servants to help your family members They will help them choose the way home to God even as they are attacked by Satan and his followers whose purpose it is to destroy families in this life and in eternity You remember the words spoken by the angel to Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah in their rebellion And again the angel said Behold the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people and also the prayers of his servant Alma who is thy father for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth therefore for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith 14My promise to you who pray and serve the Lord cannot be that you will have every blessing you may wish for yourself and your family But I can promise you that the Savior will draw close to you and bless you and your family with what is best You will have the comfort of His love and feel the answer of His drawing closer as you reach out your arms in giving service to others As you bind up the wounds of those in need and offer the cleansing of His Atonement to those who sorrow in sin the Lord s power will sustain you His arms are outstretched with yours to succor and bless the children of our Heavenly Father including those in your family There is a glorious homecoming prepared for us We will then see fulfilled the promise of the Lord we have loved It is He who welcomes us into eternal life with Him and our Heavenly Father Jesus Christ described it this way Seek to bring forth and establish my Zion Keep my commandments in all things And if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God 15 For those that live shall inherit the earth and those that die shall rest from all their labors and their works shall follow them and they shall receive a crown in the mansions of my Father which I have prepared for them 16I testify that we can by the Spirit follow the invitation of Heavenly Father This is My Beloved Son Hear Him 17By His words and His example Christ has shown us how to draw closer to Him Every child of Heavenly Father who has chosen to enter through the gate of baptism into His Church will have the opportunity in this life to be taught His gospel and to hear from His called servants His invitation Come unto me 18Every covenant servant of His within His kingdom on earth and in the spirit world will receive His guidance by the Spirit as they bless and serve others for Him And they will feel His love and find joy in being drawn closer to Him I am a witness of the Resurrection of the Lord as surely as if I had been there in the evening with the two disciples in the house on Emmaus road I know that He lives as surely as did Joseph Smith when he saw the Father and the Son in the light of a brilliant morning in a grove of trees in Palmyra This is the true Church of Jesus Christ Only in the priesthood keys held by President Thomas S Monson is the power for us to be sealed in families to live forever with our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ We will on the Day of Judgment stand before the Savior face to face It will be a time of joy for those who have drawn close to Him in His service in this life It will be a joy to hear the words Well done thou good and faithful servant 19 I so testify as a witness of the risen Savior and our Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Lord made it clear at the very start of this last dispensation that we were to take the gospel to all the world What He said to the few priesthood holders in 1831 He says to the many now Whatever our age capacity Church calling or location we are as one called to the work to help Him in His harvest of souls until He comes again He said to those first laborers in the vineyard And again I say unto you I give unto you a commandment that every man both elder priest teacher and also member go to with his might with the labor of his hands to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded And let your preaching be the warning voice every man to his neighbor in mildness and in meekness And go ye out from among the wicked Save yourselves Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord 1Now you members of the Aaronic Priesthood can see that the Lord s command includes you Since you know that the Lord always prepares a way to keep His commandments you can expect that He will do that for each of you Let me tell you of how He did it for one boy who now holds the office of priest in the Aaronic Priesthood He is 16 years old He lives in a country where the missionaries first arrived just a year ago They were assigned to two cities but not to the city where the boy lives When he was very young his parents brought him to Utah for safety The family was taught and baptized by the missionaries He was not baptized into the Church because he was not yet eight years of age His parents were killed in an accident So his grandmother had him return to his home across the ocean back to the city where he had been born He was walking on the street in March just a year ago when he felt that he should speak to a woman he did not know He spoke with her in the English he still remembered She was a nurse sent by the mission president to his city to look for housing and medical care for the missionaries who would be assigned there soon He and she became friends as they talked When she got back to the mission headquarters she told the missionaries about him The first two elders arrived in September of 2012 The orphan boy was their first baptism into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints By March of this year he had been a member for four months He had been ordained a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood and so could baptize the second convert to the Church He was the first priesthood pioneer to gather other children of Heavenly Father with him to establish the Church in a city of approximately 130 000 people On Easter Sunday March 31 2013 the Church membership there had grown to the huge number of six members in that city He was the only local member who attended the meeting that Sunday His knee had been injured the day before but he was determined to be there He had prayed that he would be able to walk to church And so he was there He shared the sacrament with four young elders and a missionary couple the total congregation That story does not seem remarkable unless you recognize in it the pattern of God s hand in building His kingdom I have seen it many times I saw it in New Mexico as a young man For generations the prophets have told us that we must help the missionaries find and teach the honest in heart and then love those who come into the kingdom I have seen for myself what faithful priesthood leaders and members can do In 1955 I became an officer in the United States Air Force My bishop at home gave me a blessing just before I left for my first station which was in Albuquerque New Mexico In his blessing he said that my time in the air force would be missionary service I arrived in church on my first Sunday at the Albuquerque First Branch A man walked up to me introduced himself as the district president and told me that he was going to call me to serve as a district missionary I told him that I would be there for training for only a few weeks and then I would be assigned somewhere else in the world He said I don t know about that but we are to call you to serve In the middle of my military training by what appeared to be chance I was chosen from hundreds of officers being trained to take the place in headquarters of an officer who had died suddenly So for the two years I was there I worked in my office On most evenings and every weekend I taught the gospel of Jesus Christ to people the members brought to us My companions and I averaged more than 40 hours a month in our missionary service without once having to knock on doors to find someone to teach The members filled our plates so full that we often taught two families in an evening I saw for myself the power and the blessing in the repeated call of prophets for every member to be a missionary On the last Sunday before I left Albuquerque the first stake was organized in that city There is now a sacred temple there a house of the Lord in a city where we once met in a single chapel with Saints who brought friends to us to be taught and to feel the witness of the Spirit Those friends felt a welcoming home in the Lord s true Church I saw it next in New England as I went to school I was called as the counselor to a great district president who had been brought from disinterest in the Church to a man of great spiritual power His home teacher loved him enough to ignore his cigar and see what God could see in him The district president and I drove over the hills and along the shores to visit tiny branches that dotted Massachusetts and Rhode Island to build and bless the kingdom of God In the years I served with that great leader we watched people draw friends to the Church by their example and by their invitation to listen to the missionaries To me the growth of those branches seemed slow and faltering But on the Sunday I left five years later two Apostles came to organize our district into a stake in the Longfellow Park chapel in Cambridge Years later I returned to conduct a stake conference there The stake president took me to see a rocky hill in Belmont He told me it would be a perfect place for a temple of God One stands there now When I gaze on it I remember the humble members I sat with in tiny branches the neighbors they invited and the missionaries who were teaching them There is a new deacon in this meeting here tonight I was with him on the same Easter Sunday that the priest whom I spoke of previously walked to his one member meeting The deacon beamed as his father said that he would be in this priesthood meeting with him tonight This father was a great missionary in the same mission where his father had been the president I have seen the 1937 Missionary Handbook of his great grandfather His heritage in bringing people to the Church runs deep So I spoke with that deacon s bishop to learn what experiences the boy might expect in meeting the charge of the priesthood to work in the gathering of souls for the Lord The bishop was enthusiastic as he described how the ward mission leader tracked the progress of investigators He gets that information from regular contact with the missionaries The bishop and his ward council discuss every progressing investigator They decide what they can do for each person and their families to help them become friends before baptism to include them in activities and to nurture those who are baptized He said the missionaries on occasion have enough appointments to teach that they take Aaronic Priesthood holders as companions The ward mission plan includes the goals of the quorums to invite those they know to meet with the missionaries Even the deacons quorum presidency is invited to set goals and plan for their quorum members to help bring those they know into the kingdom of God Now the deacon in the strong ward and the new priest the convert in the tiny member group may seem to have little in common with each other or with you And you may not see much similarity with your experiences in building up the Church with what I saw as miracles in New Mexico and in New England But there is one way in which we are one in our charge in the priesthood We sanctify ourselves and fulfill our individual duties to the commandment to take the gospel to all of our Heavenly Father s children We share experiences in the way in which the Lord builds His kingdom on earth In His Church with all the wonderful tools and organization we have been given there is still a fundamental truth taught by prophets of how we are to fulfill our priesthood mandate of missionary work In the 1959 April general conference President David O McKay taught this principle as have the prophets since his day including President Thomas S Monson President McKay related in his closing comments that in 1923 in the British Mission there was a general instruction sent out to the members of the Church They were told not to spend money on advertising to combat the bad feelings of the people against the Church President McKay said the decision was Throw the responsibility upon every member of the Church that in the coming year of 1923 every member will be a missionary Every member a missionary You may bring your mother into the Church or it may be your father perhaps your fellow companion in the workshop Somebody will hear the good message of the truth through you And President McKay continued And that is the message today Every member a million and a half a missionary 2When it was announced in 2002 that missionary work would become the responsibility of the bishops I marveled I d been one It seemed to me they were already carrying a load close to their limits in ministering to the members and directing the organizations in the ward One bishop I knew saw it not as an added duty but as an opportunity to draw the ward together in a great cause where every member became a missionary He called a ward mission leader He met with the missionaries himself every Saturday to learn about their work to encourage them and to learn about the progress of their investigators The ward council found ways for organizations and quorums to use service experiences as missionary preparation And as a judge in Israel he helped young people feel the blessings of the Atonement to keep them pure Recently I asked how he explained the surge of convert baptisms in his ward and the increase in the number of young people ready and eager to take the gospel of Jesus Christ out to the world He said it seemed to him that it was not so much the duty anyone performed but the way they all became one in their enthusiasm to bring people into the community of Saints that had brought them such happiness For some it was that and more Like the sons of Mosiah they had felt the effects of sin in their own lives and the marvelous healing of the Atonement within the Church of God Out of love and gratitude for the Savior s gift to them they wanted to help everyone they could to escape the sadness of sin feel the joy of forgiveness and gather with them to safety in the kingdom of God It was the love of God and the love for their friends and neighbors that unified them to serve the people They desired to take the gospel to everyone in their part of the world And they prepared their children to be worthy to be called by the Lord to teach to testify and to serve in other parts of His vineyard Whether it is in the large ward where the new deacon will perform his duty to share the gospel and build up the kingdom or in the tiny group far away where the new priest serves they will be one in purpose The deacon will be inspired by the love of God to reach out to a friend not yet a member He will include his friend in some service or activity in the Church and then invite him and his family to be taught by the missionaries To those who are baptized he will be the friend they will need The priest will invite others to join with him in the tiny group of Saints where he has felt the love of God and the blessed peace of the Atonement If he continues faithful in his priesthood duty he will see the group become a branch and then a stake of Zion will come to his city There will be a ward with a caring bishop It could be one of his sons or grandsons who will someday take a servant of God to a nearby hill and say This would be a wonderful place for a temple I pray that wherever we are and whatever duties we have in the priesthood of God we will be united in the cause to bring the gospel to all the world and that we will encourage people we love to be cleansed from sin and to be happy with us in the kingdom of God In the name of Jesus Christ whose Church this is amen

I m so grateful for this opportunity to be in this great priesthood meeting to have heard such wonderful teaching and testimony It made me think of my own experience Almost everything that I ve been able to accomplish as a priesthood bearer is because individuals who knew me saw things in me that I couldn t see As a young father I prayed to know what contributions my children might make in the Lord s kingdom For the boys I knew they could have priesthood opportunities For the girls I knew they would give service representing the Lord All would be doing His work I knew each was an individual and therefore the Lord would have given them specific gifts for each to use in His service Now I cannot tell every father and every leader of youth the details of what is best for you to do But I can promise you that you will bless them to help them recognize the spiritual gifts with which they were born Every person is different and has a different contribution to make No one is destined to fail As you seek revelation to see gifts God sees in those you lead in the priesthood particularly the young you will be blessed to lift their sights to the service they can perform With your guidance those you lead will be able to see want and believe they can achieve their full potential for service in God s kingdom With my own children I prayed for revelation to know how I could help each of them individually prepare for specific opportunities to serve God And then I tried to help them visualize hope and work for this future I carved a board for each son with a quotation from scripture that described his special gifts and an image that represented this gift Beneath the picture and the legend I carved the dates of each boy s baptism and ordination into priesthood offices with his height marked at the date of each milestone I will describe the boards I carved for each son to help him see his spiritual gifts and what he might contribute in the Lord s work You can be inspired to recognize as I did specific gifts and unique opportunities for each of the youth you love and lead When my oldest son became a deacon and an Eagle Scout a picture of an eagle came to my mind as I thought of him and his future We were living in Idaho near the base of the South Teton mountain where we hiked together and watched the eagles soar That picture in my mind gave me the feeling of Isaiah s words He giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength Even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint 1In fact with that oldest son we had stopped hiking below the peak of the South Teton because my son grew weary He wanted to stop He said Will I always be sorry that we didn t make it to the top Dad you go on I don t want you to be disappointed I replied I ll never be disappointed and you ll never be sorry We ll always remember that we climbed here together At the top of his height board I carved an eagle and the inscription On Eagles Wings Over the years my son soared higher as a missionary than I had imagined in my fondest hopes In the challenges of the mission field some of what he faced seemed to be above his reach For the boy you lift it may be as it was for my son that the Lord lifted him higher in preaching the gospel in a difficult language than I had thought possible If you will try with any young man to sense his priesthood possibilities I promise you the Lord will tell you as much as you need The boy may have potential even beyond what the Lord will reveal to you Help him aim high The boy you are encouraging may seem too timid to be a powerful priesthood servant Another one of my sons was so shy as a little boy that he wouldn t walk into a store and talk to a clerk He was too afraid I worried as I prayed over his priesthood future I thought of him in the mission field that didn t sound promising I was led to a scripture in Proverbs The wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion 2I carved Bold as a Lion on his board beneath an image of a large lion s head roaring On his mission and in the years that followed he fulfilled the hope in my carving My once shy son preached the gospel with great conviction and faced dangers with bravery He was magnified in his responsibilities to represent the Lord That can happen for the young man you are leading You need to build his faith that the Lord can transform him into a servant braver than the timid boy you now see We know the Lord makes His servants bold The young boy Joseph who saw God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ in a grove of trees was transformed into a spiritual giant Parley P Pratt saw that when the Prophet Joseph Smith rebuked the vile guards who held them captive Elder Pratt recorded On a sudden he arose to his feet and spoke in a voice of thunder or as the roaring lion uttering as near as I can recollect the following words SILENCE ye fiends of the infernal pit In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you and command you to be still I will not live another minute and hear such language Cease such talk or you or I die THIS INSTANT Of that experience Elder Pratt wrote Dignity and majesty have I seen but once as it stood in chains at midnight in a dungeon in an obscure village of Missouri 3The Lord will give His righteous servants opportunities to be bold as lions when they speak in His name and as witnesses in His priesthood Another son even as a boy had a large circle of friends who often sought his company He forged bonds easily among people As I prayed and tried to foresee his contribution in God s kingdom I felt that he would have the power to draw people together in love and unity That led me to the account in the Doctrine and Covenants that describes the efforts of priesthood elders to build Zion in Missouri to the acclaim of angels who saw their efforts and their contributions That required great sacrifice The revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants says Nevertheless ye are blessed for the testimony which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon and they rejoice over you and your sins are forgiven you 4On my son s height board I carved Angels Rejoice over You This son s great ability to gather and influence people extended well beyond his school years With fellow priesthood holders he organized stake activities that gave the youth in his area faith to endure and even triumph in difficult situations As he built faith in these young men and women he helped build outposts of Zion in the urban centers of America In the carving I had the angels blowing trumpets which may not be exactly how they do it but it was easier to carve a trumpet than a shout Angels rejoice as priesthood leaders across the world build Zion in their wards stakes and missions And they will rejoice over the young men and women you help to build Zion wherever they are and in whatever circumstances they may be Zion is the result of people bound by covenant and love I invite you to help your youth to join For one of my sons I was prompted to carve a sun that is the sun in the sky and the words from the Savior s Intercessory Prayer This Is Life Eternal Near the end of His mortal ministry the Savior prayed to His Father And this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do 5My son has given priesthood service across three continents but most importantly in his home and within his family He has built his life around them He works close to home and he often returns to join his wife and younger children at the lunch hour His family lives very near Sister Eyring and me They care for our yard as though it were their own This son is living not only to qualify for eternal life but also to live surrounded eternally by grateful family members whom he is gathering around him Life eternal is to live in unity in families with the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost Eternal life is only possible through the keys of the priesthood of God which were restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith Holding that eternal goal before the youth you lead is as great a gift as you could give them You will do it primarily by example in your own family Those you lead may not have a family in the Church but I challenge you to help them feel and want the love of family on both sides of the veil The height boards I have described are only one way to help young people glimpse the grandeur God sees in them and their futures and the unique service He has prepared them to give He will help you see how to do it for your children or for other youth you lead But as you prayerfully seek to glimpse this future for yourself and to communicate it to the young person one on one you will come to know that God loves each of His children as individuals and sees great and unique gifts in each of them As a father I was blessed to see great futures in God s kingdom for my daughters as well as my sons When I prayerfully sought guidance I was shown a way to help my daughters recognize the trust God had placed in them as servants who could build His kingdom When my daughters were young I saw that we could help others feel the love of those beyond the veil throughout the generations I knew that love comes from service and inspires hope of life eternal So we carved breadboards on which we placed a loaf of homemade bread and went together to deliver our offering to widows widowers and families The legend I carved on each of those breadboards read J aime et J espere French for I love and I hope The evidence of their unique spiritual gifts appeared not just on the boards I carved but more clearly as we distributed them to those who needed in the midst of pain or loss reassurance that the love of the Savior and His Atonement could produce a perfect brightness of hope This is life eternal for my daughters and for each of us Now you may be thinking Brother Eyring are you saying that I have to learn how to carve The answer is no I learned to carve only with the help of a kind and gifted mentor then Elder Boyd K Packer What little skill I achieved can be attributed to his great gift as a carver and his patience as a teacher Only heaven can provide such a mentor as President Packer But there are many ways you can shape children s hearts without carving wooden boards or height boards for them For example new communication technologies allow sharing messages of faith and hope across the miles that separate us instantaneously and at little or no cost My wife helps me do this We begin by talking by telephone with grandchildren or children we can reach We ask them to share stories of their personal successes and their service rendered We also invite them to send photos of those activities We use those photos to illustrate a few paragraphs of text We add one or two verses from the Book of Mormon Perhaps Nephi and Mormon wouldn t be very impressed by the spiritual quality of our content or the limited effort required to create what we call The Family Journal The Small Plates But Sister Eyring and I are blessed by the effort We feel inspired in selecting the passages of scripture and the brief messages of testimony we write And we see evidence in their lives of their hearts being turned toward us and to the Savior and upward There are other ways to reach out you are already engaged in many of them Your habits of family prayer and scripture reading will create more lasting memories and greater changes of heart than you may realize now Even apparently temporal activities such as attending an athletic event or watching a movie can shape a child s heart What matters is not the activity but the feelings that come as you do it I have discovered a good test for identifying activities with the potential to make a great difference in a young person s life It is that they suggest the activity out of an interest they feel has come to them as a gift from God I know that is possible from my own experience When I became a deacon at the age of 12 I lived in New Jersey 50 miles 80 km from New York City I dreamed of being a great baseball player My father agreed to take me to see a game played in the old and storied Yankee Stadium in the Bronx I can still see the swing of the bat as Joe DiMaggio hit a home run into the center field stands with my father sitting beside me the only time we ever went to a major league baseball game together But another day with my father shaped my life forever He took me from New Jersey to the home of an ordained patriarch in Salt Lake City I had never seen the man before My father left me at the doorstep The patriarch led me to a chair placed his hands on my head and pronounced a blessing as a gift from God that included a declaration of the great desire of my heart He said that I was one of those of whom it had been said Blessed are the peacemakers 6 I was so surprised that a perfect stranger could know my heart that I opened my eyes to see the room where such a miracle was happening That blessing of my possibilities has shaped my life my marriage and my priesthood service From that experience and what has followed it I can testify For all have not every gift given unto them for there are many gifts and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God 7By the Lord revealing to me a gift I have been able to recognize and prepare for opportunities to exercise it to the blessing of those I love and serve God knows our gifts My challenge to you and to me is to pray to know the gifts we have been given to know how to develop them and to recognize the opportunities to serve others that God provides us But most of all I pray that you will be inspired to help others discover their special gifts from God to serve I promise you that if you ask you will be blessed to help and lift others to their full potential in the service of those they lead and love I testify to you that God lives Jesus is the Christ this is the priesthood of God which we hold and God has prepared us with special gifts to serve Him beyond our fondest hopes In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be in your company tonight The women of the Church of Jesus Christ have been moving toward becoming the society of sisters that the Prophet Joseph Smith s mother Lucy Mack Smith described in these words We must cherish one another watch over one another comfort one another and gain instruction that we may all sit down in heaven together 1There are three parts to that remarkable description of the qualifications to associate in a state of happiness with God One is to care for each other Another is to teach each other and be taught And the third is to sit down together with God My purpose tonight is to help you feel the commendation and appreciation of God for what you have already done to help each other reach that lofty goal And second it is to describe some of what is yet to come in your unified service Like the sisters of an earlier time you have responded to the Lord s call to go to the relief of others In 1856 the prophet Brigham Young asked the Saints to go to the aid of handcart pioneers stranded in the mountain snows He said in that time of need to the members in general conference Your faith religion and profession of religion will never save one soul of you in the celestial kingdom of our God unless you carry out just such principles as I am now teaching you Go and bring in those people now on the plains and attend strictly to those things which we call temporal otherwise your faith will be in vain 2Women in Utah responded by the hundreds In their poverty they filled wagons with all they could spare and all they could gather from others to comfort those in distress One of those valiant sisters recorded I never took more satisfaction and I might say pleasure in any labor I ever performed in my life such a unanimity of feeling prevailed 3When the rescue was complete and the snows melted that same sister recorded the question of her faithful heart What comes next for willing hands to do 4In our time bands of valiant sisters across the earth have turned their faith into action in hundreds of places And they ask in their hearts and prayers the same question about the future of their lives of service Each of you is in a unique place in your journey to eternal life Some have years of experience and others are early in their mortal discipleship Each is unique in her personal history and her challenges But all of you are sisters and beloved daughters of our Heavenly Father who knows and watches over each of you What you have done remarkably well together is to cherish watch over and comfort each other I was a witness of that threefold miracle just one month ago in your service to one sister As her father I thank you and I want to extend my thanks to God who guided one visiting teacher Our daughter Elizabeth who lives in another state and time zone from us was at home with her three year old daughter Her other child was in her first week of kindergarten Elizabeth was six months pregnant and looking forward to the birth of her third child which the doctors said would be another girl Her husband Joshua was away at his work When she saw that she was passing blood and that the flow was increasing she called her husband on the phone He told her to call for an ambulance and that he would meet her at the hospital which was 20 minutes from her home Before she could place the call she heard a knock at the front door At the door she was surprised to see her Relief Society visiting teaching companion They had no appointment for that morning Her companion had simply felt she ought to come by to see Elizabeth She helped her into the car They arrived at the hospital minutes before Joshua arrived from his work The doctors decided in less than 20 minutes to take the baby by surgery to save Elizabeth and her baby So a tiny girl came into the world crying loudly 15 weeks ahead of schedule She weighed one pound eleven ounces 765 g But she was alive and so was Elizabeth The words of Lucy Mack Smith were in part fulfilled that day A faithful member of the Relief Society prompted by the Holy Ghost watched over cherished and comforted her sister in God s kingdom She and the tens of thousands of others who have given such inspired service over the generations have not only the thanks of those they helped and their loved ones but also of the Lord You remember His words of appreciation to those who receive little recognition for their benevolence And the King shall answer and say unto them Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me 5But the miracle of one Relief Society sister arriving to help just in time is multiplied through the power of a unified society of sisters Here is just a part of the message Elizabeth s bishop sent to Elizabeth and to Joshua at the hospital hours after the baby was born The Relief Society president has everything under control We are already building a future plan to assist with your girls at home so Elizabeth can travel back and forth to the hospital while the unnamed cute baby remains there We ve done it before long term and our people jump at the chance The bishop went on to say speaking for himself and the ward We ve even come to the hospital and sat with kids in the playroom when moms didn t want to leave them somewhere else And then We won t execute our plan without coordination and concurrence from you of course Just wanted to let you know not to worry about the things we can and will do What they did for my daughter made it possible for her to have a precious moment when she held for the first time her tiny daughter And then the bishop closed his message to Joshua and Elizabeth with one that sisters send out of their commitment across the earth to serve others for the Master Keep the faith With all your differences in personal circumstances and past experiences I can tell you something of what lies ahead for you As you keep the faith you will find yourself invited by the Lord often to serve someone in need when it will not seem convenient It may appear to be an unpleasant and perhaps even impossible task When the call comes it may seem you are not needed or that someone else could easily give the succor Remember that when the Lord lets us encounter someone in distress we honor the good Samaritan for what he did not do as much as for what he did He did not pass by on the other side even though the beaten traveler on the road was a stranger and perhaps an enemy He did what he could for the beaten man and then put in place a specific plan for others to do more He did that because he understood that helping may require more than what one person can do Lessons in that story can guide you in whatever your future holds Those same lessons were available in your own childhood and recent experiences At least once and perhaps often you have been surprised when you encountered someone in need of care It may have been a parent a grandparent a sister or a child struck by illness or disability Your feelings of compassion prevailed over your human desires So you began to offer help Like the traveler in the scripture story of the good Samaritan it is likely that the help needed turned into longer term care than you could give alone The Samaritan needed to pass the traveler to the care of the innkeeper The Lord s plan for serving others in need provides teams Bishops and Relief Society presidents always invite family members to help each other when there is a need There are many reasons for that principle Foremost is to provide to more people the blessing of increased love that comes from serving each other You have observed and felt that blessing Whenever you have cared for someone for even a short time you have felt love for the person you served As the time to provide needed care grew longer the feelings of love increased Since we are mortal that increase in love may be interrupted by feelings of frustration and fatigue That is another reason why the Lord lets us have the help of others in our service to those in need That is why the Lord has created societies of caregivers A few weeks ago I was present as a young woman rose to be sustained in a sacrament meeting as the assistant coordinator of visiting teaching a position I did not know existed I wondered if she knew what a tribute the Lord had paid her Because of a restless child she had to leave the meeting before I could tell her how much the Lord would love and appreciate her for her help coordinating the efforts of His disciples Caring for those in need takes a team a loving and unified society That is what the Lord is building among you He loves you for any part you play One evidence of His appreciation is that God allows you to feel increasing love for those you serve That is a reason why you weep at the death of someone you have served for a long time Losing the chance to care for them can feel like an even greater loss than does the temporary separation I heard a woman whom I have known a long time recently the week her husband died bear a testimony of gratitude for the chance to serve him to the very end of his life No tears were visible but her happy smile was Even though extended and loving service to people is richly rewarded you have learned that there are physical emotional and financial limits to what is possible The person giving care long enough can become the one who needs care The Lord who is the Master Nurturer of people in need gave inspired counsel to weary caregivers in these words delivered by King Benjamin and recorded in the Book of Mormon For the sake of retaining a remission of your sins I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor every man according to that which he hath such as feeding the hungry clothing the naked visiting the sick and administering to their relief both spiritually and temporally according to their wants 6But then He goes on to warn those of you who might fail to respond to the evidence that you are pushing on too far and too long in your loving service And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order for it is not requisite that a man or any caregiver should run faster than he has strength And again it is expedient that he should be diligent that thereby he might win the prize therefore all things must be done in order 7That counsel can be hard to apply when the choice seems to be balancing a desire to do all you can to help others with the wisdom to be prudent in meeting your own needs to retain your power to serve You may have seen others struggle with such hard choices One example is the choice to care for a person approaching the end of life at home or in a care facility when you may be close to exhaustion What you know of the plan of salvation can be your guide in such heartrending choices That is one of the reasons why Lucy Mack Smith wisely said that the sisters were to gain instruction It helps to have a sure conviction of the purpose of the Lord for every child of God in the crucible of mortal life He taught the essence of the plan of salvation to the Prophet Joseph this way as he struggled to understand his seemingly endless trials And then if thou endure it well God shall exalt thee on high 8Our choice to best help someone through hard trials then becomes What course should I follow that will best help the person I love to endure well It is for us to make it more likely that he or she can exercise faith in Christ keep a bright hope of eternal life and practice charity the pure love of Christ to the end of his or her life I have seen sisters in the kingdom put that focus on the Savior and His purpose Think of the times you have gone into the room where the Relief Society or the Primary or the Young Women have met A picture of the Savior or His words may not be evident but you know a testimony of the reality and value of His Atonement has been felt in that hour as it has been this evening There may not be a picture of a holy temple or the words Families Can Be Forever but you can see hope in their smiles And you have seen as I have a wise visiting teacher build the confidence in a struggling sister that her service to someone else even as she is failing is still needed and valuable Great Relief Society presidents find ways to let those who need care help in the care of others They create opportunities for sisters to endure trials well as they care for each other in the pure love of Christ That may include gentle urging of the tired giver of care to rest and accept the help of others The sisters make that possible by being slow to judge those going through trials Most people carrying heavy loads begin to doubt themselves and their own worth We lighten their loads as we are patient with their weaknesses and celebrate whatever goodness we can see in them The Lord does that And we could follow His example He the greatest nurturer of all We speak often of the strength of the circle of sisters in the Church of Jesus Christ We must learn to recognize that the Savior is always in the circle as we invite Him More and more we will see daughters of God invite sisters into the circle with them As sisters come into a meeting and look for a seat they will hear the softly spoken words Please come sit here with me We will hear those words in that future day Lucy Mack Smith foresaw when the sisters will sit down in heaven together We do not prepare for that day in a moment It will come from days and years of caring for each other and taking the words of eternal life down deep into our hearts My prayer is that many of us will be together in the glorious future that lies before us I bear you my testimony that your hope for those days will be justified The Lord Jesus Christ through His infinite Atonement made it possible for each of you Heavenly Father hears and answers your prayers of faith for guidance and for help to endure in your service for Him The Holy Ghost is sent to you and to those you care for You will be strengthened and yet inspired to know the limits and extent of your ability to serve The Spirit will comfort you when you may wonder Did I do enough I testify that the Lord will be with you and that your way will be prepared and marked for you by Him in your service to those He loves in their needs and trials In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
In the depths of his anguish in Liberty Jail the Prophet Joseph Smith cried out O God where art thou And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place 1 Many of us in moments of personal anguish feel that God is far from us The pavilion that seems to intercept divine aid does not cover God but occasionally covers us God is never hidden yet sometimes we are covered by a pavilion of motivations that draw us away from God and make Him seem distant and inaccessible Our own desires rather than a feeling of Thy will be done 2 create the feeling of a pavilion blocking God God is not unable to see us or communicate with us but we may be unwilling to listen or submit to His will and His time Our feelings of separation from God will diminish as we become more childlike before Him That is not easy in a world where the opinions of other human beings can have such an effect on our motives But it will help us recognize this truth God is close to us and aware of us and never hides from His faithful children My three year old granddaughter illustrated the power of innocence and humility to connect us with God She went with her family to the open house of the Brigham City Temple in Utah In one of the rooms of that beautiful building she looked around and asked Mommy where is Jesus Her mother explained that she would not see Jesus in the temple but she would be able to feel His influence in her heart Eliza carefully considered her mother s response and then seemed satisfied and said Oh Jesus is gone helping someone she concluded No pavilion obscured Eliza s understanding or obstructed her view of reality God is close to her and she feels close to Him She knew that the temple is the house of the Lord but also understood that the resurrected and glorified Jesus Christ has a body and can only be in one place at a time 3 If He was not at His house she recognized that He must be in another place And from what she knows of the Savior she knew that He would be somewhere doing good for His Father s children It was clear that she had hoped to see Jesus not for a confirming miracle of His existence but simply because she loved Him The Spirit could reveal to her childlike mind and heart the comfort all of us need and want Jesus Christ lives knows us watches over us and cares for us In moments of pain loneliness or confusion we do not need to see Jesus Christ to know that He is aware of our circumstances and that His mission is to bless I know from my own life that Eliza s experience can be our own long after we leave childhood In the early years of my career I worked hard to secure a tenured professorship at Stanford University I thought I had made a good life for myself and for my family We lived close to my wife s parents in very comfortable surroundings By the world s standards I had achieved success But I was given by the Church the chance to leave California and go to Ricks College in Rexburg Idaho My lifetime professional objectives might have been a pavilion dividing me from a loving Father who knew better than I did what my future could hold But I was blessed to know that whatever success I had in my career and family life to that point was a gift from God And so like a child I knelt in prayer to ask what I should do I was able to hear a quiet voice in my mind that said It s my school There was no pavilion shielding me from God In faith and humility I submitted my will to His and felt His care and closeness My years at Ricks College during which I tried to seek God s will and do it kept the pavilion from covering me or obscuring God s active role in my life As I sought to do His work I felt close to Him and felt assurance that He knew of my affairs and cared deeply for my happiness But as they had at Stanford worldly motivations began to present themselves to me One was an attractive job offer extended just as I was finishing my fifth year as president of Ricks College I considered the offer and prayed about it and even discussed it with the First Presidency They responded with warmth and a little humor but certainly not with any direction President Spencer W Kimball listened to me describe the offer I had received from a large corporation and said Well Hal that sounds like a wonderful opportunity And if we ever needed you we d know where to find you They would have known where to find me but my desires for professional success might have created a pavilion that would make it hard for me to find God and harder for me to listen to and follow His invitations My wife sensing this had a strong impression that we were not to leave Ricks College I said That s good enough for me But she insisted wisely that I must get my own revelation And so I prayed again This time I did receive direction in the form of a voice in my mind that said I ll let you stay at Ricks College a little longer My personal ambitions might have clouded my view of reality and made it hard for me to receive revelation Thirty days after I was blessed with the inspired decision to turn down the job offer and stay at Ricks College the Teton Dam burst nearby God knew that dam would burst and that hundreds of people would need help He let me seek counsel and gain His permission to stay at Ricks College He knew all the reasons that my service might still be valuable at the college and in Rexburg So I was there to ask Heavenly Father frequently in prayer that He would have me do those things that would help the people whose property and lives had been damaged I spent hours working with other people to clear mud and water from homes My desire to know and do His will gave me a soul stretching opportunity That incident illustrates another way we can create a barrier to knowing God s will or feeling His love for us we can t insist on our timetable when the Lord has His own I thought I had spent enough time in my service in Rexburg and was in a hurry to move on Sometimes our insistence on acting according to our own timetable can obscure His will for us In Liberty Jail the Prophet Joseph asked the Lord to punish those who persecuted the members of the Church in Missouri His prayer was for sure and swift retribution But the Lord responded that in not many years hence 4 He would deal with those enemies of the Church In the 24th and 25th verses of the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants He says Behold mine eyes see and know all their works and I have in reserve a swift judgment in the season thereof for them all For there is a time appointed for every man according as his works shall be 5We remove the pavilion when we feel and pray Thy will be done and in Thine own time His time should be soon enough for us since we know that He wants only what is best One of my daughters in law spent many years feeling that God had placed a pavilion over her She was a young mother of three who longed for more children After two miscarriages her prayers of pleading grew anguished As more barren years passed she felt tempted to anger When her youngest went off to school the emptiness of her house seemed to mock her focus on motherhood so did the unplanned and even unwanted pregnancies of acquaintances She felt as committed and consecrated as Mary who declared Behold the handmaid of the Lord 6 But although she spoke these words in her heart she could hear nothing in reply Hoping to lift her spirits her husband invited her to join him on a business trip to California While he attended meetings she walked along the beautiful empty beach Her heart ready to burst she prayed aloud For the first time she asked not for another child but for a divine errand Heavenly Father she cried I will give you all of my time please show me how to fill it She expressed her willingness to take her family wherever they might be required to go That prayer produced an unexpected feeling of peace It did not satisfy her mind s craving for certainty but for the first time in years it calmed her heart The prayer removed the pavilion and opened the windows of heaven Within two weeks she learned that she was expecting a child The new baby was just one year old when a mission call came to my son and my daughter in law Having promised to go and do anything anywhere she put fear aside and took her children overseas In the mission field she had another child on a missionary transfer day Submitting fully to heaven s will as this young mother did is essential to removing the spiritual pavilions we sometimes put over our heads But it does not guarantee immediate answers to our prayers Abraham s heart seems to have been right long before Sarah conceived Isaac and before they received their promised land Heaven had other purposes to fulfill first Those purposes included not only building Abraham and Sarah s faith but also teaching them eternal truths that they shared with others on their long circuitous route to the land prepared for them The Lord s delays often seem long some last a lifetime But they are always calculated to bless They need never be times of loneliness or sorrow or impatience Although His time is not always our time we can be sure that the Lord keeps His promises For any of you who now feel that He is hard to reach I testify that the day will come that we all will see Him face to face Just as there is nothing now to obscure His view of us there will be nothing to obscure our view of Him We will all stand before Him in person Like my granddaughter we want to see Jesus Christ now but our certain reunion with Him at the judgment bar will be more pleasing if we first do the things that make Him as familiar to us as we are to Him As we serve Him we become like Him and we feel closer to Him as we approach that day when nothing will hide our view The movement toward God can be ongoing Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world 7 the Savior teaches And then He tells us how For I was an hungred and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye took me in Naked and ye clothed me I was sick and ye visited me I was in prison and ye came unto me Then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee Or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee And the King shall answer and say unto them Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me 8As we do what He would have us do for His Father s children the Lord considers it kindness to Him and we will feel closer to Him as we feel His love and His approval In time we will become like Him and will think of the Judgment Day with happy anticipation The pavilion that seems to be hiding you from God may be fear of man rather than this desire to serve others The Savior s only motivation was to help people Many of you as I have have felt fear in approaching someone you have offended or who has hurt you And yet I have seen the Lord melt hearts time after time including my own And so I challenge you to go for the Lord to someone despite any fear you may have to extend love and forgiveness I promise you that as you do you will feel the love of the Savior for that person and His love for you and it will not seem to come from a great distance For you that challenge may be in a family it may be in a community or it may be across a nation But if you go for the Lord to bless others He will see and reward it If you do this often enough and long enough you will feel a change in your very nature through the Atonement of Jesus Christ Not only will you feel closer to Him but you will also feel more and more that you are becoming like Him Then when you do see Him as we all will it will be for you as it was for Moroni when he said And now I bid unto all farewell I soon go to rest in the paradise of God until my spirit and body shall again reunite and I am brought forth triumphant through the air to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead Amen 9If we serve with faith humility and a desire to do God s will I testify that the judgment bar of the great Jehovah will be pleasing We will see our loving Father and His Son as They see us now with perfect clarity and with perfect love In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I appreciate being gathered with you in this meeting to which all the holders of the priesthood of God in the earth are invited We are blessed to be presided over by President Thomas S Monson As the President of the Church he is the one man alive who is responsible for the keys that seal families and all those priesthood ordinances necessary to attain eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God There is a father listening tonight who has come back from inactivity because he wants the assurance of that gift with all his heart He and his wife love their two small children a boy and a girl Like other parents he can foresee heavenly happiness when he reads these words And that same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there only it will be coupled with eternal glory which glory we do not now enjoy 1That father listening with us tonight knows the path to that glorious destination It is not easy He already knows that It took faith in Jesus Christ deep repentance and a change in his heart that came with a kind bishop helping him feel the Lord s loving forgiveness Wonderful changes continued as he went to the holy temple for an endowment that the Lord described to those whom He empowered in the first temple in this dispensation It was in Kirtland Ohio The Lord said of that Wherefore for this cause I gave unto you the commandment that ye should go to the Ohio and there I will give unto you my law and there you shall be endowed with power from on high And from thence for I have a great work laid up in store for Israel shall be saved and I will lead them whithersoever I will and no power shall stay my hand 2For my recently activated friend and for all the priesthood a great work ahead is to lead in saving the part of Israel for which we are or will be responsible our families My friend and his wife knew that requires being sealed by the power of the Melchizedek Priesthood in a holy temple of God He asked that I perform the sealing He and his wife wanted it done as soon as possible But with the busy time of general conference approaching I left it to the couple and their bishop to work with my secretary to find the best date Imagine my surprise and delight when the father told me in church that the sealing is set for April 3 That was the day in 1836 when Elijah the translated prophet was sent to the Kirtland Temple to give the sealing power to Joseph Smith and to Oliver Cowdery Those keys reside in the Church today and will continue to the end of time 3It is the same divine authorization given by the Lord to Peter as He had promised And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven 4The return of Elijah blessed all who hold the priesthood Elder Harold B Lee made that clear as he spoke in general conference quoting President Joseph Fielding Smith Listen carefully I hold the priesthood you brethren here hold the priesthood we have received the Melchizedek Priesthood which was held by Elijah and by other prophets and by Peter James and John But while we have authority to baptize while we have authority to lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and to ordain others and do all these things without the sealing power we could do nothing for there would be no validity to that which we did President Smith went on The higher ordinances the greater blessings which are essential to exaltation in the kingdom of God and which can only be obtained in certain places no man has a right to perform except as he receives the authority to do it from the one who holds the keys There is no man upon the face of this earth who has the right to go forth and administer in any of the ordinances of this gospel unless the President of the Church who holds the keys sanctions it He has given us authority he has put the sealing power in our priesthood because he holds those keys 5That same assurance came from President Boyd K Packer as he wrote of the sealing power Knowing these words are true is a comfort to me as it will be to the family I will seal on April 3 Peter was to hold the keys Peter was to hold the sealing power to bind or seal on earth or to loose on earth and it would be so in the heavens Those keys belong to the President of the Church to the prophet seer and revelator That sacred sealing power is with the Church now Nothing is regarded with more sacred contemplation by those who know the significance of this authority Nothing is more closely held There are relatively few men who hold this sealing power upon the earth at any given time in each temple are brethren who have been given the sealing power No one can get it except from the prophet seer and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 6At the coming of Elijah not only was power given to the priesthood but also hearts were to be turned The spirit power and calling of Elijah is that ye have power to hold the key of the revelation ordinances oracles powers and endowments of the fullness of the Melchizedek Priesthood and of the kingdom of God on the earth and to receive obtain and perform all the ordinances belonging to the kingdom of God even unto the turning of the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are in heaven 7That feeling of his heart turning has already come to my friend and to his family It may have come to you in this meeting You may have seen in your mind as I have the face of your father or your mother It may have been a sister or a brother It may have been a daughter or a son They may be in the spirit world or continents away from you But joy came from a feeling that connections with them are sure because you are or can be bound to them by priesthood ordinances that God will honor Melchizedek Priesthood holders who are fathers in sealed families have been taught what they must do There is nothing that has come or will come into your family as important as the sealing blessings There is nothing more important than honoring the marriage and family covenants you have made or will make in the temples of God The way to do that is clear The Holy Spirit of Promise through our obedience and sacrifice must seal our temple covenants in order to be realized in the world to come President Harold B Lee explained what it means to be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise by quoting Elder Melvin J Ballard We may deceive men but we cannot deceive the Holy Ghost and our blessings will not be eternal unless they are also sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise The Holy Ghost is one who reads the thoughts and hearts of men and gives his sealing approval to the blessings pronounced upon their heads Then it is binding efficacious and of full force 8When Sister Eyring and I were sealed in the Logan Utah Temple I did not understand then the full significance of that promise I am still trying to understand all that it means but my wife and I decided at the start of our nearly 50 years of marriage to invite the Holy Ghost as much as we could into our lives and into our family As a young father sealed in the temple and with my heart turned to my wife and a young family I met President Joseph Fielding Smith for the first time In the First Presidency council room where I had been invited came an absolutely sure witness to me as President Harold B Lee asked me indicating President Smith who was sitting next to him Do you believe that this man could be the prophet of God President Smith had just entered the room and had not yet spoken a word I am eternally grateful that I was able to answer because of what came down into my heart I know he is and I knew it as surely as I knew the sun was shining that he held the priesthood sealing power for all the earth That experience gave his words great power for me and my wife when in a conference session on April 6 1972 President Joseph Fielding Smith gave the following counsel It is the will of the Lord to strengthen and preserve the family unit We plead with fathers to take their rightful place as the head of the house We ask mothers to sustain and support their husbands and to be lights to their children 9Let me suggest four things you can do as a priesthood father to lift and lead your family home again to be with Heavenly Father and the Savior First gain and keep a sure witness that the keys of the priesthood are with us and held by the President of the Church Pray for that every day The answer will come with an increase in determination to lead your family in your feelings of hope and with greater happiness in your service You will be more cheerful and optimistic a great blessing for your wife and family The second imperative is to love your wife It will take faith and humility to put her interests above your own in the struggles of life You have the responsibility to provide for and to nurture the family with her while serving others That can at times consume all the energy and strength you have Age and illness may increase your wife s needs If you choose even then to put her happiness above your own I promise you that your love for her will increase Third enlist the entire family to love each other President Ezra Taft Benson taught In an eternal sense salvation is a family affair Above all else children need to know and feel they are loved wanted and appreciated They need to be assured of that often Obviously this is a role parents should fill and most often the mother can do it best 10But another crucial source for that feeling of being loved is love from other children in the family Consistent care of brothers and sisters for each other will come only with persistent effort by parents and the help of God You know that is true from experience in your own families And it is confirmed each time you read of the family conflicts faced by righteous Lehi and his wife Sariah in the Book of Mormon record The successes they won provide a guide for us They taught the gospel of Jesus Christ so well and so persistently that children and even some descendants over generations had hearts softened toward God and toward each other For instance Nephi and others wrote and reached out to family members who had been their enemies The Spirit at times softened the hearts of thousands and replaced hatred with love One way for you to reproduce the successes of Father Lehi is by the way you lead family prayers and family time such as family home evenings Give children opportunities to pray when they can pray for each other in the circle who need blessings Discern quickly the beginnings of discord and recognize acts of unselfish service especially to each other When they pray for each other and serve each other hearts will be softened and turned to each other and to their parents The fourth opportunity to lead your family in the Lord s way comes when discipline is needed We can meet our obligation to correct in the Lord s way and then lead our children toward eternal life You will remember the words but you may not have seen their power for a Melchizedek Priesthood holder preparing his family for living in the same sociality that they will have in the celestial kingdom You remember the words They are so familiar No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by long suffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned By kindness and pure knowledge which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy and without guile Reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the Holy Ghost and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death 11And later the promise comes of great worth for us as fathers in Zion The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever 12That is a high standard for us but when we with faith control our tempers and subdue our pride the Holy Ghost gives His approval and sacred promises and covenants become sure You will succeed through your faith that the Lord sent back the keys of the priesthood which are still with us with a sure bond of love with your wife with the Lord s help in turning the hearts of your children to each other and to their parents and with love guiding you to correct and exhort in a way that invites the Spirit I know that Jesus is the Christ and is our Savior I testify that President Thomas S Monson holds and exercises all the keys of the priesthood on the earth today I love and sustain him I love and pray for you In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I heard President Spencer W Kimball in a session of conference ask that God would give him mountains to climb He said There are great challenges ahead of us giant opportunities to be met I welcome that exciting prospect and feel to say to the Lord humbly Give me this mountain give me these challenges 1My heart was stirred knowing as I did some of the challenges and adversity he had already faced I felt a desire to be more like him a valiant servant of God So one night I prayed for a test to prove my courage I can remember it vividly In the evening I knelt in my bedroom with a faith that seemed almost to fill my heart to bursting Within a day or two my prayer was answered The hardest trial of my life surprised and humbled me It provided me a twofold lesson First I had clear proof that God heard and answered my prayer of faith But second I began a tutorial that still goes on to learn about why I felt with such confidence that night that a great blessing could come from adversity to more than compensate for any cost The adversity that hit me in that faraway day now seems tiny compared to what has come since to me and to those I love Many of you are now passing through physical mental and emotional trials that could cause you to cry out as did one great and faithful servant of God I knew well His nurse heard him exclaim from his bed of pain When I have tried all my life to be good why has this happened to me You know how the Lord answered that question for the Prophet Joseph Smith in his prison cell And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit or into the hands of murderers and the sentence of death passed upon thee if thou be cast into the deep if the billowing surge conspire against thee if fierce winds become thine enemy if the heavens gather blackness and all the elements combine to hedge up the way and above all if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee know thou my son that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good The Son of Man hath descended below them all Art thou greater than he Therefore hold on thy way and the priesthood shall remain with thee for their bounds are set they cannot pass Thy days are known and thy years shall not be numbered less therefore fear not what man can do for God shall be with you forever and ever 2There seems to me no better answer to the question of why trials come and what we are to do than the words of the Lord Himself who passed through trials for us more terrible than we can imagine You remember His words when He counseled that we should out of faith in Him repent Therefore I command you to repent repent lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth and by my wrath and by my anger and your sufferings be sore how sore you know not how exquisite you know not yea how hard to bear you know not For behold I God have suffered these things for all that they might not suffer if they would repent But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I Which suffering caused myself even God the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore and to suffer both body and spirit and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink Nevertheless glory be to the Father and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men 3You and I have faith that the way to rise through and above trials is to believe that there is a balm in Gilead 4 and that the Lord has promised I will not forsake thee 5 That is what President Thomas S Monson has taught us to help us and those we serve in what seem lonely and overwhelming trials 6But President Monson has also wisely taught that a foundation of faith in the reality of those promises takes time to build You may have seen the need for that foundation as I have at the bedside of someone ready to give up the fight to endure to the end If the foundation of faith is not embedded in our hearts the power to endure will crumble My purpose today is to describe what I know of how we can lay that unshakable foundation I do it with great humility for two reasons First what I say could discourage some who are struggling in the midst of great adversity and feel their foundation of faith is crumbling And second I know that ever greater tests lie before me before the end of life Therefore the prescription I offer you has yet to be proven in my own life through enduring to the end As a young man I worked with a contractor building footings and foundations for new houses In the summer heat it was hard work to prepare the ground for the form into which we poured the cement for the footing There were no machines We used a pick and a shovel Building lasting foundations for buildings was hard work in those days It also required patience After we poured the footing we waited for it to cure Much as we wanted to keep the jobs moving we also waited after the pour of the foundation before we took away the forms And even more impressive to a novice builder was what seemed to be a tedious and time consuming process to put metal bars carefully inside the forms to give the finished foundation strength In a similar way the ground must be carefully prepared for our foundation of faith to withstand the storms that will come into every life That solid basis for a foundation of faith is personal integrity Our choosing the right consistently whenever the choice is placed before us creates the solid ground under our faith It can begin in childhood since every soul is born with the free gift of the Spirit of Christ With that Spirit we can know when we have done what is right before God and when we have done wrong in His sight Those choices hundreds in most days prepare the solid ground on which our edifice of faith is built The metal framework around which the substance of our faith is poured is the gospel of Jesus Christ with all its covenants ordinances and principles One of the keys to an enduring faith is to judge correctly the curing time required That is why I was unwise to pray so soon in my life for higher mountains to climb and greater tests That curing does not come automatically through the passage of time but it does take time Getting older does not do it alone It is serving God and others persistently with full heart and soul that turns testimony of truth into unbreakable spiritual strength Now I wish to encourage those who are in the midst of hard trials who feel their faith may be fading under the onslaught of troubles Trouble itself can be your way to strengthen and finally gain unshakable faith Moroni the son of Mormon in the Book of Mormon told us how that blessing could come to pass He teaches the simple and sweet truth that acting on even a twig of faith allows God to grow it And now I Moroni would speak somewhat concerning these things I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen wherefore dispute not because ye see not for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers after he had risen from the dead and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him wherefore it must needs be that some had faith in him for he showed himself not unto the world But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world and glorified the name of the Father and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift that they might hope for those things which they have not seen Wherefore ye may also have hope and be partakers of the gift if ye will but have faith 7That particle of faith most precious and which you should protect and use to whatever extent you can is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ Moroni taught the power of that faith this way And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith wherefore they first believed in the Son of God 8I have visited with a woman who received the miracle of sufficient strength to endure unimaginable losses with just the simple capacity to repeat endlessly the words I know that my Redeemer lives 9 That faith and those words of testimony were still there in the mist that obscured but did not erase memories of her childhood I was stunned to learn that another woman had forgiven a person who had wronged her for years I was surprised and asked her why she had chosen to forgive and forget so many years of spiteful abuse She said quietly It was the hardest thing I have ever done but I just knew I had to do it So I did Her faith that the Savior would forgive her if she forgave others prepared her with a feeling of peace and hope as she faced death just months after she had forgiven her unrepentant adversary She asked me When I get there how will it be in heaven And I said I know just from what I have seen of your capacity to exercise faith and to forgive that it will be a wonderful homecoming for you I have another encouragement to those who now wonder if their faith in Jesus Christ will be sufficient for them to endure well to the end I was blessed to have known others of you who are listening now when you were younger vibrant gifted beyond most of those around you yet you chose to do what the Savior would have done Out of your abundance you found ways to help and care for those you might have ignored or looked down upon from your place in life When hard trials come the faith to endure them well will be there built as you may now notice but may have not at the time that you acted on the pure love of Christ serving and forgiving others as the Savior would have done You built a foundation of faith from loving as the Savior loved and serving for Him Your faith in Him led to acts of charity that will bring you hope It is never too late to strengthen the foundation of faith There is always time With faith in the Savior you can repent and plead for forgiveness There is someone you can forgive There is someone you can thank There is someone you can serve and lift You can do it wherever you are and however alone and deserted you may feel I cannot promise an end to your adversity in this life I cannot assure you that your trials will seem to you to be only for a moment One of the characteristics of trials in life is that they seem to make clocks slow down and then appear almost to stop There are reasons for that Knowing those reasons may not give much comfort but it can give you a feeling of patience Those reasons come from this one fact in Their perfect love for you Heavenly Father and the Savior want you fitted to be with Them to live in families forever Only those washed perfectly clean through the Atonement of Jesus Christ can be there My mother fought cancer for nearly 10 years Treatments and surgeries and finally confinement to her bed were some of her trials I remember my father saying as he watched her take her last breath A little girl has gone home to rest One of the speakers at her funeral was President Spencer W Kimball Among the tributes he paid I remember one that went something like this Some of you may have thought that Mildred suffered so long and so much because of something she had done wrong that required the trials He then said No it was that God just wanted her to be polished a little more I remember at the time thinking If a woman that good needed that much polishing what is ahead for me If we have faith in Jesus Christ the hardest as well as the easiest times in life can be a blessing In all conditions we can choose the right with the guidance of the Spirit We have the gospel of Jesus Christ to shape and guide our lives if we choose it And with prophets revealing to us our place in the plan of salvation we can live with perfect hope and a feeling of peace We never need to feel that we are alone or unloved in the Lord s service because we never are We can feel the love of God The Savior has promised angels on our left and our right to bear us up 10 And He always keeps His word I testify that God the Father lives and that His Beloved Son is our Redeemer The Holy Ghost has confirmed truth in this conference and will again as you seek it as you listen and as you later study the messages of the Lord s authorized servants who are here President Thomas S Monson is the Lord s prophet to the entire world The Lord watches over you God the Father lives His Beloved Son Jesus Christ is our Redeemer His love is unfailing I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen

My dear brethren it is a joy for me to be with you in this worldwide meeting of the priesthood of God Tonight I will speak of priesthood preparation both our own and that which we help provide for others Most of us must wonder to ourselves at times Am I prepared for this assignment in the priesthood My answer is Yes you have been prepared My purpose today is to help you recognize that preparation and draw courage from it As you know the Aaronic Priesthood is designated as a preparatory priesthood The great majority of Aaronic Priesthood holders are young deacons teachers and priests between 12 and 19 years of age We may come to think of priesthood preparation as occurring in the Aaronic Priesthood years But our Heavenly Father has been preparing us since we were taught at His knee in His kingdom before we were born He is preparing us tonight And He will continue to prepare us as long as we will let Him The purpose of all priesthood preparation in the premortal life and in this life is to fit us and those we serve for Him for eternal life Some of the first lessons in the premortal life surely included the plan of salvation with Jesus Christ and His Atonement at its center We were not only taught the plan but were in councils where we chose it Because a veil of forgetfulness was placed over our minds at birth we have had to find a way to relearn in this life what we once knew and defended Part of our preparation in this life has been to find that precious truth so that we can then recommit to it by covenant That has required faith humility and courage on our part as well as help from people who had found the truth and then shared it with us It may have been parents missionaries or friends But that help was part of our preparation Our priesthood preparation always includes others who have already been prepared to offer us the opportunity to accept the gospel and then choose to act by keeping covenants to get them down into our hearts For us to qualify for eternal life our service in this life must include working with all our heart might mind and strength to prepare others to return to God with us So part of the priesthood preparation we will have in this life will be opportunities to serve and teach others It may include being teachers in the Church wise and loving fathers members of a quorum and missionaries for the Lord Jesus Christ The Lord will offer the opportunities but whether we are prepared will depend on us My intent tonight is to point out some of the crucial choices necessary for priesthood preparation to succeed Good choices both by the person training and the one being trained depend on some understanding of how the Lord prepares His priesthood servants First He calls people young and old who may appear to worldly eyes and even to themselves to be weak and simple The Lord can turn those apparent shortcomings into strengths That will change the way the wise leader chooses whom to train and how to train And it can change how the priesthood holder responds to the development opportunities he is offered Let s consider some examples I was an inexperienced priest in a large ward My bishop called me on the phone one Sunday afternoon When I answered he said Do you have time to go with me I need your help He explained only that he wanted me to go as his companion to visit a woman I did not know who was without food and who needed to learn how to manage her finances better Now I knew that he had two seasoned counselors in his bishopric Both were mature men of great experience One counselor was the owner of a large business who later became a mission president and a General Authority The other counselor was a prominent judge in the city I was the bishop s newly called first assistant in the priests quorum He knew that I understood little about welfare principles I knew even less about financial management I had not yet written a check I had no bank account I hadn t even seen a personal budget Yet despite my inexperience I sensed that he was deadly serious when he said I need your help I have come to understand what that inspired bishop meant He saw in me a golden opportunity to prepare a priesthood holder I am sure that he did not foresee in that untrained boy a future member of the Presiding Bishopric But he treated me that day and all the days I knew him over the years as a preparation project of great promise He seemed to enjoy it but it was work for him On our return to my home after we visited the widow in need he parked the car He opened his well worn and heavily marked scriptures And he gave me kindly correction He told me that I needed to study the scriptures and learn more But he must have seen that I was weak and simple enough to be teachable To this day I remember what he taught that afternoon But even more I remember how confident he was that I could learn and be better and that I would He saw beyond the reality of who I was to the possibilities that lie inside someone who feels weak and simple enough to want the Lord s help and to believe that it will come Bishops mission presidents and fathers can choose to act on those possibilities I saw it happen recently in a fast meeting as a deacons quorum president bore his testimony He was about to become a teacher and leave his quorum members behind him He testified with great feeling in his voice of the growth in goodness and power in the members of his quorum I ve never heard a person praise an organization more wonderfully than he did He praised their service And then he said that he knew that he had been able to help the new deacons when they felt overwhelmed because he had felt overwhelmed when he came into the priesthood His feelings of weakness had made him more patient more sympathetic and therefore better able to strengthen and serve others In those two years in the Aaronic Priesthood it seemed to me he had become seasoned and wise He had learned that he was helped as a quorum president by a clear and vivid memory of his own needs when he was two years younger His challenge in the future in his leadership and ours will come when such memories fade and grow dim through time and our success Paul must have seen that danger in counsel to his younger companion in the priesthood Timothy He encouraged and instructed him in his own priesthood preparation and in helping the Lord prepare others Listen to what Paul said to Timothy his younger companion Let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity Till I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine Neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine 1 continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee 2Paul gave good counsel for all of us Don t worry about how inexperienced you are or think you are but think about what with the Lord s help you can become The doctrine that Paul urges us to feast upon in our priesthood preparation is the words of Christ and so to qualify for the receipt of the Holy Ghost Then we can know what the Lord would have us do in our service and receive the courage to do it whatever difficulty we face in the future We are being prepared for priesthood service that will become more challenging with time For instance our muscles and our brains age as we do Our capacity to learn and remember what we have read will diminish To give the priesthood service the Lord expects of us will take more and more self discipline every day of our lives We can be prepared for that test by building faith through service as we go The Lord has given us the opportunity to prepare by something He has called the oath and covenant of the priesthood 3It is a covenant we make with God to keep all His commandments and give service as He would give it if He were personally present Living up to that standard as best we can builds the strength we will need to endure to the end Great priesthood trainers have shown me how to build that strength it is to form a habit of pushing on through the fatigue and fear that might make you think of quitting The Lord s great mentors have shown me that spiritual staying power comes from working past the point when others would have taken a rest You great priesthood leaders who have built that spiritual strength in your youth still possess it when physical strength weakens My younger brother was in a small Utah city on business He got a phone call at his hotel from President Spencer W Kimball It was late at night after what was a hard day of work for my brother and surely for President Kimball who began the conversation this way He said I heard that you were in town I know it s late and that you may be in bed but could you help me I need you as my companion to see the condition of all our chapels in this city My brother went with him that night lacking knowledge of chapel maintenance or anything about chapels and not knowing why President Kimball would be doing such a thing after his long day or why he needed any help Years later I received a similar call late at night in a hotel in Japan I was then the new commissioner of education for the Church I knew that President Gordon B Hinckley was staying somewhere in that same hotel on his separate assignment to Japan I answered the ringing phone just after I had lain down on the bed to sleep exhausted by having done all I thought I had the strength to do President Hinckley asked in his pleasant voice Why are you sleeping when I am here reading a manuscript that we have been asked to review So I got up and went to work even though I knew that President Hinckley could give a better review of a manuscript than I could possibly do But somehow he made me feel that he needed my help President Thomas S Monson at the end of almost every meeting asks the secretary to the First Presidency Am I up to date on my work And he always smiles when the answer comes back Oh yes President you are President Monson s pleased smile sends me a message It makes me think Is there something more I could do on my assignments And then I go back to my office to work Great teachers have shown me how to prepare to keep the oath and covenant when time and age will make it harder They have shown and taught me how to discipline myself to work harder than I thought I could while I still have health and strength I can t be a perfect servant every hour but I can try to give more effort than I thought I could With that habit formed early on I will be prepared for trials later You and I can be prepared with the strength to keep our oath and covenant through the tests that will surely come as we approach the end of life I saw evidence of that in a Church Board of Education meeting President Spencer W Kimball by then had given years of service while enduring a series of health challenges only Job would understand He was chairing the meeting that morning Suddenly he stopped speaking He slumped in his chair His eyes closed His head fell on his chest I was seated near him Elder Holland was next to us The two of us rose to help him Inexperienced as we were in emergencies we decided to carry him still seated in his chair to his nearby office He became our teacher in that moment of his extremity With one of us lifting each side of his chair we went out of the meeting room into the hallway of the Church Administration Building He half opened his eyes still dazed and said Oh please be careful Don t hurt your backs As we got near his office door he said Oh I feel terrible that I interrupted the meeting Minutes after we got him into his office still not knowing what his problems were he looked up at us and said Don t you think you ought to go back to the meeting We left and hurried back knowing that somehow our being there must matter to the Lord President Kimball had since his childhood pushed himself beyond his limits of endurance to serve and to love the Lord It was a habit so ingrained that it was there when he needed it He was prepared And so he was able to teach and show us how to be prepared to keep the oath and covenant by steady preparation over the years through all our strength in what might appear to be little tasks with small consequences My prayer is that we may keep our priesthood covenants to qualify ourselves for eternal life and those we are called to train I promise you if you do all that you can God will magnify your strength and your wisdom He will season you I promise you that those whom you train and set an example for will praise your name as I have this day the great trainers I have known I testify that God the Father lives and loves you He knows you He and His resurrected and glorified Son Jesus Christ appeared to an inexperienced boy Joseph Smith They trusted him with the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel and of the true Church They encouraged him when he needed it They let him feel loving chastening when it would bring him down to lift him up They prepared him and They are preparing us for the strength to keep working toward the celestial glory that is the aim and the reason of all priesthood service I leave you my blessing that you will be able to recognize the glorious opportunities God has given you in calling and preparing you to His service and the service of others In the name of our loving leader and teacher Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to you on this Sabbath in a general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Every member of the Church has the same sacred charge We accepted it and promised to rise to it as we were baptized We learn from the words of Alma the great Book of Mormon prophet what we promised God that we would become Willing to mourn with those that mourn yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places that ye may be in even until death that ye may be redeemed of God and be numbered with those of the first resurrection that ye may have eternal life 1That is a lofty charge and a glorious promise from God My message today is of encouragement Just as the Book of Mormon makes the charge plain to us it also directs us upward on the path to eternal life First we promised to become charitable Second we promised to become witnesses of God And third we promised to endure The Book of Mormon is the best guide to learn how well we are doing and how to do better Let s begin with becoming charitable I will remind you of recent experiences Many of you participated in a day of service There were thousands of them organized across the world A council of your fellow Saints prayed to know what service to plan They asked God to know whom we should serve what service to give and whom to invite to participate They may even have prayed not to forget shovels or drinking water Above all they prayed that all who gave service and all who received it would feel the love of God I know those prayers were answered in at least one ward More than 120 members volunteered to help In three hours they transformed the grounds of a church in our community It was hard and happy work The ministers of the church expressed gratitude All who worked together that day felt unity and greater love Some even said that they felt joy as they pulled weeds and trimmed shrubbery Words from the Book of Mormon helped them know why they felt that joy It was King Benjamin who said to his people Learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are in the service of your God 2 And it was Mormon who taught in his words in the Book of Mormon Charity is the pure love of Christ and it endureth forever and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day it shall be well with him 3The Lord is keeping His promise to you as you keep yours As you serve others for Him He lets you feel His love And in time feelings of charity become part of your very nature And you will receive the assurance of Mormon in your heart as you persist in serving others in life that all will be well with you Just as you promised God to become charitable you promised to be His witness wherever you may be throughout your life Again the Book of Mormon is the best guide I know to help us keep that promise I was once invited to speak at graduation services at a university The university president had wanted President Gordon B Hinckley to be invited but found that he was unavailable So by default I got the invitation I was then a junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The person who invited me to speak became anxious as she learned more about my obligations as an Apostle She called me on the phone and said that she now understood that my duty was to be a witness of Jesus Christ In very firm tones she told me that I could not do that when I spoke there She explained that the university respected people of all religious beliefs including those who denied the existence of a God She repeated You cannot fulfill your duty here I hung up the phone with serious questions in my mind Should I tell the university that I would not keep my agreement to speak It was only two weeks before the event My appearance there had been announced What effect would my failing to keep my agreement have on the good name of the Church I prayed to know what God would have me do The answer came in a surprising way to me I realized that the examples of Nephi Abinadi Alma Amulek and the sons of Mosiah applied to what I was They were bold witnesses of Jesus Christ in the face of deadly peril So the only choice to be made was how to prepare I dug into everything I could learn about the university As the day of the talk grew closer my anxiety rose and my prayers intensified In a miracle like the Red Sea parting I found a news article That university had been honored for doing what the Church has learned to do in our humanitarian efforts across the world And so in my talk I described what we and they had done to lift people in great need I said that I knew that Jesus Christ was the source of the blessings that had come into the lives of those we and they had served After the meeting the audience rose to applaud which seemed a little unusual to me I was amazed but still a little anxious I remembered what happened to Abinadi Only Alma had accepted his witness But that night at a large formal dinner I heard the university president say that in my talk he heard the words of God Now such a miraculous deliverance is rare in my experience as a witness of Christ But the effect of the Book of Mormon on your character power and courage to be a witness for God is certain The doctrine and the valiant examples in that book will lift guide and embolden you Every missionary who is proclaiming the name and gospel of Jesus Christ will be blessed by daily feasting from the Book of Mormon Parents who struggle to get a witness of the Savior into the heart of a child will be helped as they seek for a way to bring the words and the spirit of the Book of Mormon into the home and all the lives in their family That has proven true for us I can see that miracle is happening in every sacrament meeting and every class I attend in the Church Speakers and teachers show a love and mature understanding of the scriptures especially the Book of Mormon And personal testimonies clearly come from deep within their hearts They teach with increased conviction and bear witness with power I see evidence as well that we are doing better in the third part of the promise we all made at baptism We covenanted to endure to keep the commandments of God as long as we live I visited the hospital room of an old friend who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer I took with me my two young daughters I did not expect that she would even be able to recognize them Her own family were gathered standing around her bed as we entered She looked up and smiled I will always remember her look as she saw that we had brought our daughters with us She motioned them to come close to her on the bed She sat up held them and introduced them to her family She spoke of the greatness of those two little girls It was as if she were presenting princesses to a royal court I expected our visit to end quickly Surely I thought she is tired But as I watched it was as if the years melted away She was radiant and obviously filled with love for all of us She seemed to savor the moment as if time had stopped She had spent most of her life succoring children for the Lord She knew from the account in the Book of Mormon that the resurrected Savior had taken little children one by one blessed them and then wept for joy 4 She had experienced that joy long enough herself to be able to endure in His loving service to the end I saw that same miracle in the bedroom of a man who had given sufficient faithful service to think that he had done enough to rest I knew that he had undergone lengthy and painful treatment for a disease and had been told by the doctors that it was terminal They offered neither treatment nor hope His wife took me to his bedroom in their home There he was lying on his back on the top of the carefully made up bed He wore a freshly pressed white shirt a tie and new shoes He saw the look of surprise in my eyes laughed quietly and explained After you give me a blessing I want to be ready to respond to the call to take up my bed and go to work As it turned out he was ready for the interview he would soon have with the Master for whom he had worked so faithfully He was an example of the fully converted Latter day Saints I meet often after they have given a life of dedicated service They press on President Marion G Romney described it this way In one who is wholly converted desire for things contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ has actually died and substituted therefor is a love of God with a fixed and controlling determination to keep his commandments 5It is that fixed determination I see more and more often in the seasoned disciples of Jesus Christ Like the sister greeting my daughters and the man in the new shoes ready to get up and march they follow the Savior s command to the end All of you have seen it You can look at it again if you return to the Book of Mormon I still feel admiration in my heart when I read these words of an aging and determined servant of God For even at this time my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you but the Lord doth support me and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you 6You can take courage as I do from the example of endurance given us by Moroni He was alone in his ministry He knew the end of life was near for him And yet listen to what he wrote for the sake of people not yet born and the descendants of his mortal enemies Yea come unto Christ and be perfected in him and deny yourselves of all ungodliness and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love God with all your might mind and strength then is his grace sufficient for you that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ 7Moroni gave that witness as the valedictory to his life and ministry He urged charity as do the prophets throughout the Book of Mormon He added his witness of the Savior when death loomed before him He was a truly converted child of God as we can be filled with charity constant and fearless as a witness of the Savior and His gospel and determined to endure to the end Moroni taught us what that requires of us He said that the first step to full conversion is faith Prayerful study of the Book of Mormon will build faith in God the Father in His Beloved Son and in His gospel It will build your faith in God s prophets ancient and modern It can draw you closer to God than any other book It can change a life for the better I urge you to do what a missionary companion of mine did He had run away from home as a teenager and someone had placed a Book of Mormon in a box he carried with him in his search for more happiness Years passed He moved from place to place across the world He was alone and unhappy one day when he saw the box The box was filled with things he had carried with him At the bottom of the box he found the Book of Mormon He read the promise in it and tested it He knew it was true That witness changed his life He found happiness beyond his fondest dreams Your copy of the Book of Mormon may be hidden from your view by cares and attention to all you have accumulated in your journey I plead with you to drink deeply and often from its pages It has in it the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ which is the only way home to God I leave you my sure witness that God lives and will answer your prayers Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world The Book of Mormon is a true and sure witness that He lives that He is our resurrected and living Savior The Book of Mormon is a precious witness I now leave with you my witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be with you in this meeting of the priesthood of God We are in many different places tonight and at many stages in our priesthood service Yet with all the variety of our circumstances we have a need in common It is to learn our duties in the priesthood and to grow in our power to perform them As a deacon I felt keenly that need I lived in a tiny branch of the Church in New Jersey on the East Coast of the United States I was the only deacon in the branch not just the only one attending but the only one on the records My older brother Ted was the only teacher He is here tonight While I was still a deacon my family moved to Utah There I found three wonderful things in place to speed my growth in the priesthood The first was a president who knew how to sit in council with the members of his quorum The second was great faith in Jesus Christ that led to the great love we have heard of love for each other And the third was a shared conviction that our overarching priesthood purpose was to labor for the salvation of men It wasn t the well established ward that made the difference What was there in that ward could be anywhere in whatever unit of the Church you are in These three things may be so much a part of your experience in the priesthood that you hardly notice them For others you may not feel the need for growth so these helps may be invisible to you Either way I pray that the Spirit will help me make them clear and attractive to you My purpose in speaking of these three aids to growing in the priesthood is to urge you to value them and to use them If you do your service will be transformed for the better And if it is magnified your priesthood service will bless Heavenly Father s children more than you can now imagine is possible I found the first when I was welcomed into a priests quorum with the bishop as our president That may seem a small unremarkable thing to you but it gave me a sense of power in the priesthood that has changed my service in the priesthood ever since It began by the way he led us As near as I could tell he treated the opinions of young priests as if we were the wisest men in the world He waited until all who would speak had spoken He listened And when he decided what should be done it seemed to me that the Spirit confirmed the decisions to us and to him I realize now I had felt what the scripture means when it says that the president is to sit in council with the members of his quorum 1 And years later as I was a bishop with my priests quorum both they and I were taught by what I had learned as a young priest Twenty years later as a bishop I had the opportunity to see the effectiveness of a council not just in the meetinghouse but also in the mountains During a Saturday activity a member of our quorum had been lost in the forest overnight As far as we knew he was alone and without warm clothes food or shelter We searched for him without success My memory is that we prayed together the priests quorum and I and I then asked each to speak I listened intently and it seemed to me that they did too to each other After a while a feeling of peace settled on us I felt that our lost quorum member was safe and dry somewhere It became clear to me what the quorum was to do and not to do When the people who found him described the place in the woods where he had gone for safety I felt that I recognized it But the larger miracle for me was to see a united priesthood council s faith in Jesus Christ bringing revelation to the man with the priesthood keys We all grew that day in the power of the priesthood The second key to increased learning is to have love for each other that comes from great faith I am not sure which comes first but both always seem to be there whenever there is great and rapid learning in the priesthood Joseph Smith taught that to us by example In the early days of the Church in this dispensation he received a command from God to build strength in the priesthood He was directed to create schools for priesthood holders The Lord set the requirement that there be love for each other among those who were to teach and to be taught Here are the words of the Lord about creating a place of priesthood learning and what it was like for those who were to learn in it Organize yourselves establish a house of learning a house of order Appoint among yourselves a teacher and let not all be spokesmen at once but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all and that every man may have an equal privilege 2The Lord is describing what we have already seen is the strength of a priesthood council or a class to bring revelation by the Spirit Revelation is the only way we can come to know that Jesus is the Christ That great faith is the first rung on the ladder we climb to learn the principles of the gospel In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants in verses 123 and 124 the Lord stressed love for each other and not finding fault with each other Each gained entry into the priesthood school established by the Lord s prophet by making a covenant with uplifted hands to be a friend and brother in the bonds of love 3Now we do not follow that practice today but wherever I have seen remarkable learning in the priesthood there are those bonds of love Again I have seen it as both a cause and an effect of learning gospel truths Love invites the Holy Ghost to be present to confirm truth And the joy of learning divine truths creates love in the hearts of people who shared the experience of learning The reverse is true as well Discord or jealousy inhibits the ability of the Holy Ghost to teach us and inhibits our ability to receive light and truth And the feelings of disappointment that invariably follow are the seeds of greater discord and faultfinding among those who expected a learning experience that did not come The priesthood holders who learn well together always seem to me to have great peacemakers among them You see peacemaking in priesthood classes and in councils It is the gift to help people find common ground when others are seeing differences It is the peacemaker s gift to help people see that what someone else said was a contribution rather than a correction With enough of the pure love of Christ and a desire to be peacemakers unity is possible in priesthood councils and in classes It takes patience and humility but I have seen it happen even when issues are difficult and the people in councils or classes come from vastly different backgrounds It is possible to rise to the lofty standard set by the Lord for priesthood holders in making decisions in quorums It is possible when there is great faith and love and the absence of contention Here is the Lord s requirement for His endorsement of our decisions And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same that is every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions in order to make their decisions of the same power or validity one with the other 4The third aid to learning in the priesthood comes with a shared conviction about why the Lord blesses and trusts us to hold and to exercise His priesthood It is to labor for the salvation of men This shared conviction brings unity in quorums We can begin to learn about this from the scriptural account of how we spirit sons were prepared before birth for this rare honor of holding the priesthood Speaking of those given great priesthood trust in this life the Lord said Even before they were born they with many others received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men 5In the priesthood we share the sacred duty to labor for the souls of men We must do more than learn that this is our duty It must go down into our hearts so deeply that neither the many demands on our efforts in the bloom of life nor the trials that come with age can turn us from that purpose Not long ago I visited a high priest in his home He is no longer able to come to our quorum meetings He lives alone His beautiful wife died and his children live far away from him Time and illness limit his ability to serve He still lifts weights to keep what he can of his once powerful strength When I walked into his home he stood up from his walker to greet me He invited me to sit in a chair near him We talked of our happy associations in the priesthood Then with great intensity he said to me Why am I still living Why am I still here I can t do anything I told him that he was doing something for me He was lifting me with his faith and his love Even in our short visit he made me want to be better His example of determination to do something that mattered had inspired me to try harder to serve others and the Lord But from the sad sound of his voice and the look in his eyes I could sense that I had not answered his questions He still wondered why God let him live with such limitations on his ability to serve In his usual generous way he thanked me for coming to see him As I got up to leave the nurse who comes to his home a few hours every day walked in from another room During our private conversation he had told me a little about her He said she was wonderful She had lived among the Latter day Saints most of her life but was still not a member She walked up to show me to the door He motioned toward her and said with a smile See I can t seem to do anything I have been trying to get her baptized into the Church but it hasn t worked She smiled back at him and at me I walked outside and turned toward my home nearby I realized then that the answers to his questions were planted long ago in his heart That valiant high priest was trying to do his duty taught to him through decades in the priesthood He knew that the only way that young woman could have the blessing of salvation through the gospel of Jesus Christ was to make a covenant by being baptized He had been taught according to the covenants by every president of every quorum from the deacons to the high priests He remembered and felt his own oath and covenant in the priesthood He was still keeping it He was a witness and a missionary for the Savior wherever life would take him It was already in his heart The desire of his heart was that her heart could be changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ by keeping sacred covenants His time in the school of the priesthood in this life will be relatively brief compared to eternity But even in that short span he has mastered the eternal curriculum He will carry with him wherever the Lord will call priesthood lessons of eternal worth Not only should you be eager to learn your priesthood lessons in this life but you should be optimistic about what is possible A few of us may limit in our minds our possibilities to learn what the Lord sets before us in His service One young man left his little Welsh village in the early 1840s heard the Apostles of God and came into the kingdom of God on earth He sailed with the Saints to America and drove a wagon west across the plains He was in the next company after Brigham Young coming into this valley His priesthood service included clearing and breaking ground for a farm He sold the farm for pennies on the dollar to go on a mission for the Lord in the deserts of what is now Nevada to take care of sheep He was called from that to another mission across the ocean in the very village he had left in his poverty to follow the Lord Through it all he found a way to learn with his priesthood brethren Bold missionary that he was he walked down the lane in Wales to the summer estate of a man who was four times the prime minister of England to offer him the gospel of Jesus Christ The great man let him into his mansion He was a graduate of Eton College and of Oxford University The missionary talked with him about the origins of man the central role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world and even the fate of nations At the end of their discussion the host declined the offer to accept baptism But as they parted that leader of one of the great empires of the world asked the humble missionary Where did you get your education His answer In the priesthood of God You may have thought at one time how much better your life would have been if only you had been admitted to study in some fine school I pray that you will see the greatness of God s love for you and of the opportunity He has given you to enter His priesthood school If you will be diligent and obedient in the priesthood treasures of spiritual knowledge will be poured out upon you You will grow in your power to resist evil and to proclaim the truth that leads to salvation You will find joy in the happiness of those you lead toward exaltation Your family will become a place of learning I testify that the keys of the priesthood have been restored President Thomas S Monson holds and exercises those keys God lives and knows you perfectly Jesus Christ lives You were chosen for the honor of holding the sacred priesthood In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters the purpose of my message is to honor and celebrate what the Lord has done and is doing to serve the poor and the needy among His children on earth He loves His children in need and also those who want to help And He has created ways to bless both those who need help and those who will give it Our Heavenly Father hears the prayers of His children across the earth pleading for food to eat for clothes to cover their bodies and for the dignity that would come from being able to provide for themselves Those pleas have reached Him since He placed men and women on the earth You learn of those needs where you live and from across the world Your heart is often stirred with feelings of sympathy When you meet someone struggling to find employment you feel that desire to help You feel it when you go into the home of a widow and see that she has no food You feel it when you see photographs of crying children sitting in the ruins of their home destroyed by an earthquake or by fire Because the Lord hears their cries and feels your deep compassion for them He has from the beginning of time provided ways for His disciples to help He has invited His children to consecrate their time their means and themselves to join with Him in serving others His way of helping has at times been called living the law of consecration In another period His way was called the united order In our time it is called the Church welfare program The names and the details of operation are changed to fit the needs and conditions of people But always the Lord s way to help those in temporal need requires people who out of love have consecrated themselves and what they have to God and to His work He has invited and commanded us to participate in His work to lift up those in need We make a covenant to do that in the waters of baptism and in the holy temples of God We renew the covenant on Sundays when we partake of the sacrament My purpose today is to describe some of the opportunities He has provided for us to help others in need I cannot speak of them all in our brief time together My hope is to renew and strengthen your commitment to act There is a hymn about the Lord s invitation to this work that I have sung since I was a little boy In my childhood I paid more attention to the happy tune than to the power of the words I pray that you will feel the lyrics in your hearts today Let s listen to the words again Have I done any good in the world today Have I helped anyone in need Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad If not I have failed indeed Has anyone s burden been lighter todayBecause I was willing to share Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way When they needed my help was I there Then wake up and do something moreThan dream of your mansion above Doing good is a pleasure a joy beyond measure A blessing of duty and love 1The Lord regularly sends wake up calls to all of us Sometimes it may be a sudden feeling of sympathy for someone in need A father may have felt it when he saw a child fall and scrape a knee A mother may have felt it when she heard the frightened cry of her child in the night A son or a daughter may have felt sympathy for someone who seemed sad or afraid at school All of us have been touched with feelings of sympathy for others we don t even know For instance as you heard reports of the waves rushing across the Pacific after the earthquake in Japan you felt concern for those who might be hurt Feelings of sympathy came to thousands of you who learned of the flooding in Queensland Australia The news reports were mainly estimates of numbers of those in need But many of you felt the pain of the people The wake up call was answered by 1 500 or more Church member volunteers in Australia who came to help and to comfort They turned their feelings of sympathy into a decision to act on their covenants I have seen the blessings that come to the person in need who receives help and to the person who seizes the opportunity to give it Wise parents see in every need of others a way to bring blessings into the lives of their sons and daughters Three children recently carried containers holding a delicious dinner to our front door Their parents knew that we needed help and they included their children in the opportunity to serve us The parents blessed our family by their generous service By their choice to let their children participate in the giving they extended blessings to their future grandchildren The smiles of the children as they left our home made me confident that will happen They will tell their children of the joy they felt giving kindly service for the Lord I remember that feeling of quiet satisfaction from childhood as I pulled weeds for a neighbor at my father s invitation Whenever I am invited to be a giver I remember and believe the lyrics Sweet is the work my God my King 2I know those lyrics were written to describe the joy that comes from worshipping the Lord on the Sabbath But those children with the food at our door were feeling on a weekday the joy of doing the Lord s work And their parents saw the opportunity to do good and spread joy over generations The Lord s way of caring for the needy provides another opportunity for parents to bless their children I saw it in a chapel one Sunday A small child handed the bishop his family s donation envelope as he entered the chapel before the sacrament meeting I knew the family and the boy The family had just learned of someone in the ward in need The boy s father had said something like this to the child as he placed a more generous fast offering than usual in the envelope We fasted today and prayed for those in need Please give this envelope to the bishop for us I know that he will give it to help those with greater needs than ours Instead of any hunger pangs on that Sunday the boy will remember the day with a warm glow I could tell from his smile and the way he held the envelope so tightly that he felt the great trust of his father to carry the family offering for the poor He will remember that day when he is a deacon and perhaps forever I saw that same happiness in the faces of people who helped for the Lord in Idaho years ago The Teton Dam burst on Saturday June 5 1976 Eleven people were killed Thousands had to leave their homes in a few hours Some homes were washed away And hundreds of dwellings could be made habitable only through effort and means far beyond that of the owners Those who heard of the tragedy felt sympathy and some felt the call to do good Neighbors bishops Relief Society presidents quorum leaders home teachers and visiting teachers left homes and jobs to clean out the flooded houses of others One couple returned to Rexburg from a vacation just after the flood They didn t go to see their own house Instead they found their bishop to ask where they could help He directed them to a family in need After a few days they went to check on their home It was gone swept away in the flood They simply walked back to the bishop and asked Now what would you like us to do Wherever you live you have seen that miracle of sympathy turned to unselfish action It may not have been in the wake of a great natural disaster I have seen it in a priesthood quorum where a brother rises to describe the needs of a man or a woman who seeks an opportunity to work to support himself or herself and his or her family I could feel sympathy in the room but some suggested names of people who might employ the person who needed work What happened in that priesthood quorum and what happened in the flooded houses in Idaho is a manifestation of the Lord s way to help those in great need become self reliant We feel compassion and we know how to act in the Lord s way to help We celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Church welfare program this year It was started to meet the needs of those who lost employment farms and even homes in the wake of what became known as the Great Depression Great temporal needs of the children of Heavenly Father have come again in our time as they have and as they will in all times The principles at the foundation of the Church welfare program are not for only one time or one place They are for all times and all places Those principles are spiritual and eternal For that reason understanding them and putting them down into our hearts will make it possible for us to see and take opportunities to help whenever and wherever the Lord invites us Here are some principles that guided me when I wanted to help in the Lord s way and when I have been helped by others First all people are happier and feel more self respect when they can provide for themselves and their family and then reach out to take care of others I have been grateful for those who helped me meet my needs I have been even more grateful over the years for those who helped me become self reliant And then I have been most grateful for those who showed me how to use some of my surplus to help others I have learned that the way to have a surplus is to spend less than I earn With that surplus I have been able to learn that it really is better to give than to receive That is partly because when we give help in the Lord s way He blesses us President Marion G Romney said of welfare work You cannot give yourself poor in this work And then he quoted his mission president Melvin J Ballard this way A person cannot give a crust to the Lord without receiving a loaf in return 3I have found that to be true in my life When I am generous to Heavenly Father s children in need He is generous to me A second gospel principle that has been a guide to me in welfare work is the power and blessing of unity When we join hands to serve people in need the Lord unites our hearts President J Reuben Clark Jr put it this way That giving has brought a feeling of common brotherhood as men of all training and occupation have worked side by side in a Welfare garden or other project 4That increased feeling of brotherhood is true for the receiver as well as the giver To this day a man with whom I shoveled mud side by side in his flooded Rexburg home feels a bond with me And he feels greater personal dignity for having done all he could for himself and for his family If we had worked alone both of us would have lost a spiritual blessing That leads to the third principle of action in welfare work for me Draw your family into the work with you so that they can learn to care for each other as they care for others Your sons and daughters who work with you to serve others in need will be more likely to help each other when they are in need The fourth valuable principle of Church welfare I learned as a bishop It came from following the scriptural command to seek out the poor It is the duty of the bishop to find and provide help to those who still need assistance after all they and their families can do I found that the Lord sends the Holy Ghost to make it possible to seek and ye shall find 5 in caring for the poor as He does in finding truth But I also learned to involve the Relief Society president in the search She may get the revelation before you do Some of you will need that inspiration in the months ahead To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Church welfare program members worldwide will be invited to participate in a day of service Leaders and members will seek revelation as they design whatever the projects will be I will make three suggestions as you plan your service project First prepare yourself and those you lead spiritually Only if hearts are softened by the Savior s Atonement can you see clearly the goal of the project as blessing both spiritually and temporally the lives of the children of Heavenly Father My second suggestion is to choose as recipients of your service people within the kingdom or in the community whose needs will touch the hearts of those who will give the service The people they serve will feel their love That may do more to make them feel glad as the song promised than will meeting only their temporal needs My last suggestion is to plan to draw on the power of the bonds of families of quorums of auxiliary organizations and of people you know in your communities The feelings of unity will multiply the good effects of the service you give And those feelings of unity in families in the Church and in communities will grow and become a lasting legacy long after the project ends This is my opportunity to tell you how much I appreciate you By the loving service you have given for the Lord I have been the recipient of the thanks of people you have helped as I have met them across the world You found a way to lift them higher as you helped in the Lord s way You and humble disciples of the Savior like you have cast your bread upon the water in service and the people you helped have tried to give me a loaf of gratitude in return I get that same expression of appreciation from people who have worked with you I remember one time standing next to President Ezra Taft Benson We had been talking about welfare service in the Lord s Church He surprised me with his youthful vigor when he said pumping his hand I love this work and it is work For the Master I extend thanks for your work to serve the children of our Heavenly Father He knows you and He sees your effort diligence and sacrifice I pray that He will grant you the blessing of seeing the fruit of your labors in the happiness of those you have helped and with whom you have helped for the Lord I know that God the Father lives and hears our prayers I know that Jesus is the Christ You and those you serve can be purified and strengthened by serving Him and keeping His commandments You can know as I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that Joseph Smith was God s prophet to restore the true and living Church which this is I testify that President Thomas S Monson is the living prophet of God He is a great example of what the Lord did going about doing good I pray that we may seize our opportunities to lift up the hands that hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 6 In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved young sisters you are the bright hope of the Lord s Church My purpose tonight is to help you believe that is so If that belief can become a deep testimony from God it will shape your daily and hourly choices And then from what might appear to you to be small choices the Lord will lead you to the happiness you want Through your choices He will be able to bless countless others Your choice to be with us tonight is an example of choices that matter More than a million young women mothers and leaders were invited Of all the other things you could have chosen to do you chose to be with us You did that because of your beliefs You are a believer in the gospel of Jesus Christ You believe enough to come here to hear His servants and have enough faith to hope that something you will hear or feel will move you toward a better life You felt in your heart that following Jesus Christ was the way to greater happiness Now you may not have recognized that as a conscious choice of any great importance You may have felt drawn to be with us by friends or family You may have simply responded to the kindness of someone who invited you to come But even if you did not notice it you felt at least a faint echo of the invitation of the Savior Come follow me 1In the hour we have been together the Lord has deepened your belief in Him and strengthened your testimony You have heard more than words and music You have felt the witness of the Spirit to your heart that there are living prophets on the earth in the Lord s true Church and that the path to happiness lies within His kingdom Your testimony has grown that this is the only true and living Church on the earth today Now we did not all feel exactly the same things For some it was a witness of the Spirit that Thomas S Monson is a prophet of God For others it was that honesty virtue and doing good to all men really are attributes of the Savior And with that came a greater desire be like Him All of you have a desire for your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ to be strengthened President Brigham Young could see your need many years ago He was a prophet of God and with prophetic foresight 142 years ago he saw you and your needs He was a loving father and a living prophet He could see the influence of the world coming down on his own daughters He saw that those worldly influences were drawing them away from the Lord s pathway to happiness In his day those influences were brought in part by the new transcontinental railroad connecting the isolated and protected Saints to the world He may not have seen the technological marvels of today where with a device you can hold in your hand you can choose to connect to countless ideas and people across the earth But he saw the value for his daughters and for you in having their choices be made out of a powerful testimony of a living and loving God and His plan of happiness Here is his prophetic and inspired counsel for his daughters and for you always It is at the heart of my message tonight He said in a room in his home less than a mile from where this message now goes out to daughters of God in nations across the world There is need for the young daughters of Israel to get a living testimony of the truth 2He then created an association of young women that has become what we now call in the Lord s Church Young Women You have felt tonight some of the wonderful effect of his choice made in that Sunday evening meeting in the parlor of his home More than 100 years later daughters of Israel across the world have that desire for a living testimony of the truth for themselves Now for the rest of your lives you will need that living and growing testimony to fortify you and lead your path to eternal life And with it you will become the transmitters of the Light of Christ to your brothers and sisters across the world and across generations You know from your own experience what a testimony is President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that a testimony is a convincing knowledge given by revelation to a person who humbly seeks the truth He said of testimony and the Holy Ghost who brings that revelation Its convincing power is so great that there can be no doubt left in the mind when the Spirit has spoken It is the only way that a person can truly know that Jesus is the Christ and that his gospel is true 3You have felt that inspiration for yourselves It may have been to confirm one part of the gospel as it was for me tonight When I heard the words from the thirteenth article of faith about being honest true chaste and benevolent it was for me as if the Lord spoke them I felt again that those are His attributes I felt that Joseph Smith was His prophet So for me those were not just words In my mind I saw the dusty roads of Judea and the Garden of Gethsemane In my heart I felt at least something of what it would have been like to kneel as Joseph did before the Father and the Son in a grove of trees in New York I couldn t see in my mind a light above the brightness of the sun at noonday as he did but I did feel the warmth and wonder of a testimony Testimony will come to you in pieces as parts of the whole truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ are confirmed For instance as you read and ponder the Book of Mormon verses you have read before will appear new to you and bring new ideas Your testimony will grow in breadth and in depth as the Holy Ghost confirms that they are true Your living testimony will expand as you study pray and ponder in the scriptures The best description for me of how to gain and keep this living testimony has already been referred to It is in the 32nd chapter of Alma in the Book of Mormon You may have read it many times I find new light in it every time I read it Let s review the lesson it teaches once again tonight We are taught in those inspired passages to begin our quest for testimony with a particle of faith and with desire for it to grow 4 Tonight you have felt faith and that desire as you listened to stirring talks of the Savior s kindness His honesty and of the purity His commandments and Atonement made possible for us So a seed of faith is already planted in your heart You may even have felt some of the expansion of your heart promised in Alma I did But like a growing plant it must be nurtured or it will wither Frequent and heartfelt prayers of faith are crucial and needed nutrients Obedience to the truth you have received will keep the testimony alive and strengthen it Obedience to the commandments is part of the nourishment you must provide for your testimony You remember the promise of the Savior If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself 5That has worked for me as it will for you One of the doctrines of the gospel I was taught when I was young is that the greatest of all the gifts of God is eternal life 6 I learned that part of eternal life is to live together in love in families forever From the first time that I heard those truths and they were confirmed to my heart I felt obligated to make every choice I could to avoid contention and seek peace in my family and in my home Now only after this life can I enjoy the fulness of that greatest of all blessings eternal life But amidst the challenges of this life I have been given at least glimpses of what my family in heaven can be like From those experiences my testimony of the reality of the sealing power exercised in temples has grown and been strengthened Watching my two daughters be baptized in the temple for their ancestors has drawn my heart to them and to those ancestors whose names we found The promise of Elijah that hearts would be turned to each other in families has been granted to us 7 So faith for me has become certain knowledge as we are promised in the book of Alma I have experienced at least some of the joy which my ancestors felt when the Savior came into the spirit world after His mortal ministry Here is the description in the Doctrine and Covenants And the saints rejoiced in their redemption and bowed the knee and acknowledged the Son of God as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the chains of hell Their countenances shone and the radiance from the presence of the Lord rested upon them and they sang praises unto his holy name 8My feeling of their joy came from acting on my testimony that the Lord s promise of eternal life is real That testimony was strengthened by my choosing to act upon it as the Savior promised that it would be He has also taught us that in addition to choosing to be obedient we must ask in prayer for testimony of truth The Lord taught that to us in His command to pray about the Book of Mormon He said through His prophet Moroni Behold I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things and ponder it in your hearts And when ye shall receive these things I would exhort you that ye would ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ if these things are not true and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things 9I hope that you all have proved that promise for yourself or that you will do it soon The answer may not come in a single and powerful spiritual experience For me it came quietly at first But it comes ever more forcefully each time I have read and prayed over the Book of Mormon I do not depend on what has happened in the past To keep my living testimony of the Book of Mormon secure I receive the promise of Moroni often I don t take that blessing of a testimony for granted as a perpetual entitlement Testimony requires the nurturing by the prayer of faith the hungering for the word of God in the scriptures and the obedience to the truth we have received There is danger in neglecting prayer There is danger to our testimony in only casual study and reading of the scriptures They are necessary nutrients for our testimony You remember the warning from Alma But if ye neglect the tree and take no thought for its nourishment behold it will not get any root and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it because it hath no root it withers away and ye pluck it up and cast it out Now this is not because the seed was not good neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable but it is because your ground is barren and ye will not nourish the tree therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof 10Feasting on the word of God heartfelt prayer and obedience to the Lord s commandments must be applied evenly and continually for your testimony to grow and prosper All of us at times have circumstances beyond our control that interrupt our pattern of scripture study There may be periods of time when we choose for some reason not to pray There may be commandments that we choose for a time to ignore But you will not have your desire for a living testimony granted if you forget the warning and the promise in Alma And thus if ye will not nourish the word looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life But if ye will nourish the word yea nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow by your faith with great diligence and with patience looking forward to the fruit thereof it shall take root and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it that it may take root in you behold by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof which is most precious which is sweet above all that is sweet and which is white above all that is white yea and pure above all that is pure and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled that ye hunger not neither shall ye thirst Then ye shall reap the rewards of your faith and your diligence and patience and long suffering waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you 11The words in that scripture looking forward to the fruit thereof guided the wise teaching you received this evening That is why your eyes were pointed toward a future day in a temple sealing room That is why you were helped to visualize tonight the seemingly endless chain of light reflected in facing mirrors on the walls of a sealing room where you could be married in a temple of God If you can look forward to such a day with enough desire born of testimony you will be strengthened to resist the temptations of the world Each time you choose to try to live more like the Savior you will have your testimony strengthened You will come in time to know for yourself that He is the Light of the World You will come to feel light growing in your life It will not come without effort But it will come as your testimony grows and you choose to nurture it Here is the sure promise from the Doctrine and Covenants That which is of God is light and he that receiveth light and continueth in God receiveth more light and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day 12You will be a light to the world as you share your testimony with others You will reflect to others the Light of Christ in your life The Lord will find ways for that light to touch those you love And through the combined faith and testimony of His daughters God will touch the lives of millions in His kingdom and across the world with His light In your testimony and your choices lies the hope of the Church and of the generations who will follow your example of hearing and accepting the invitation of the Lord Come follow me The Lord knows and loves you I leave you my love and my testimony You are daughters of a loving and living Father in Heaven I know that His resurrected Son Jesus Christ is the Savior and the Light of the World I testify that the Holy Ghost has sent messages to you tonight confirming truth to your heart President Thomas S Monson is the living prophet of God I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen

I am grateful for this opportunity to be one with you honored by God to hold the priesthood We have been called to use divine power to serve the children of our Heavenly Father How well we meet that obligation will have eternal consequences for those we are called to serve and for us and for generations yet unborn I hold in sacred memory two priesthood bearers who had qualified for the Spirit of God to go with them on the errand to which the Lord called them They had found the restored gospel themselves in America They were the Lord s servants who first spoke of that gospel to two of my European ancestors One of those ancestors was a young girl living on a small farm in Switzerland Another was a young man an orphan and an immigrant to the United States from Germany living in St Louis Missouri Both of them heard a priesthood holder testify of the restored gospel for the girl by the fireplace of her little home in Switzerland and for the boy it was sitting in the balcony of a rented hall in America Both of them knew by the Spirit that the message those elders brought to them was true The boy and the girl chose to be baptized The two of them met for the first time on the dusty trail years later walking hundreds of miles to the mountains of western America They talked as they walked What they talked about was the miraculous blessing that in all the world the servants of God had found them and even more miraculous that they knew their message was true They fell in love and were married And because of a testimony of the Spirit which began as they heard the words of priesthood holders under the influence of the Holy Ghost they were sealed for eternity by priesthood power I am among the tens of thousands of descendants of that boy and that girl who bless the names of two priesthood holders who brought the ministrations of the Spirit of God with them as they climbed the hill in Switzerland and rose to speak in that meeting in St Louis That happy story and millions more like it are repeated across the world and will be over generations For some it will be the story of a young home teacher who said words that sparked a desire in your grandfather to come back to the Church For some it will be the words of comfort and blessing from a patriarch that sustained your mother when tragedy nearly overwhelmed her There will be a common theme in all those stories It will be the power of the priesthood in a holder whose power to serve was magnified by the Holy Ghost And so my message for us tonight is this let us do whatever is required to qualify for the Holy Ghost as our companion and then let us go forward fearlessly so that we will be given the powers to do whatever the Lord calls us to do That growth in power to serve may come slowly it may come in small steps that are difficult for you to see but it will come Tonight I will make a few suggestions for the qualification of receiving the Holy Ghost as a companion in your priesthood service Then I will give a few examples of priesthood service in which you can expect to see your powers to serve strengthened by the influence of the Spirit Now we all know that confirmation into the Church gave us the gift of the Holy Ghost But the companionship of the Holy Ghost the manifestations of it in our life and service requires us to put our lives in order to qualify We cultivate spiritual gifts by keeping the commandments and trying to live a blameless life That requires faith in Jesus Christ to repent and be cleansed through His Atonement So as priesthood holders we should never miss an opportunity to participate with all our hearts in the promise offered in every sacrament meeting for members of the restored Church to take upon them the name of God s Son and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them that they may always have his Spirit to be with them 1Just as we must be cleansed of sin to have the Spirit with us we must be humble enough before God to recognize our need for it The disciples of the resurrected Savior demonstrated that humility as recorded in the Book of Mormon The Savior was preparing them for their ministry They knelt on the ground to pray Here is the account And they did pray for that which they most desired and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them 2 They were baptized as you have been And the record says that in answer to their pleading they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire The Savior prayed aloud to thank His Father for giving the Holy Ghost to those He had chosen because of their belief in Him And then the Savior prayed for a spiritual blessing for those they were serving The Lord pled with His Father I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words 3As the humble servants of the Savior we should pray for the manifestations of the Holy Ghost to come to us in our service and to those we serve Humble prayer to our Heavenly Father in deep faith in Jesus Christ is essential to qualify us for the companionship of the Holy Ghost Our humility and our faith that invite spiritual gifts are increased by our reading studying and pondering the scriptures We have all heard those words Yet we may read a few lines or pages of scripture every day and hope that will be enough But reading studying and pondering are not the same We read words and we may get ideas We study and we may discover patterns and connections in scripture But when we ponder we invite revelation by the Spirit Pondering to me is the thinking and the praying I do after reading and studying in the scriptures carefully For me President Joseph F Smith set an example of how pondering can invite light from God It is recorded in the 138th section of the Doctrine and Covenants He had been reading and studying many scriptures trying to understand how the effects of the Savior s Atonement would reach those who had died never having heard His message Here is his account of how revelation came As I pondered over these things which are written the eyes of my understanding were opened and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me and I saw the hosts of the dead both small and great 4Repentance prayer and pondering over the scriptures are essential parts of our qualifying for the gifts of the Spirit in our priesthood service Further magnification of our power to serve will come as we respond with faith to go forward in our callings with the Holy Ghost to help us President Thomas S Monson put it this way for us What does it mean to magnify your calling It means to build it up in dignity to enlarge and strengthen it to let the light of heaven shine through it to the view of other men And how does one magnify a calling Simply by performing the service that pertains to it 5I will suggest two services to which we are all called In carrying them out under the influence of the Spirit you and others will see your power to serve strengthen and magnify The first is as His agent to teach and testify to others for Him The Lord included the youngest and the least experienced of the Aaronic Priesthood holders in that call to serve After describing the duties of the Aaronic Priesthood holders He said But neither teachers nor deacons have authority to baptize administer the sacrament or lay on hands They are however to warn expound exhort and teach and invite all to come unto Christ 6Somewhere in the world this week there will be a deacon asked by his quorum president to invite a member of their quorum whom he has never seen to a meeting The 13 year old president is not likely to use the words warn exhort and teach but that is what the Lord expects of the deacon assigned to go to the rescue To the deacon who receives the call to go to his quorum member I will make three promises First as you pray for help the Spirit will calm your fears Second you will be surprised that you know what to say when you get to his home and during the walk with him back to the church What you say may seem jumbled to you But you will feel that words were given to you at the moment you needed them And third you will feel the approval of the Lord who called you through your president whatever the outcome I cannot promise what success will come since every person is free to choose how he or she responds to a servant of God But the deacon you speak to for the Lord will remember you came to him I know of one boy now a man still far away from Church activity whom a deacon was sent to find and he told his grandfather of that visit 20 years earlier And it seemed to have no effect and yet he even named the deacon who came The grandfather asked me to find and thank the deacon who was called to invite to exhort and to teach It had been only one day in the life of a boy but a grandfather and the Lord remember the words the boy was inspired to speak and the boy s name I urge all of us young and old who are called to speak in a meeting in the name of the Lord to dismiss our feelings of self doubt and inadequacy We don t have to use soaring language or convey deep insights Simple words of testimony will do The Spirit will give you the words for you to speak and will carry them down into the hearts of humble people who look for truth from God If we keep trying to speak for the Lord we will be surprised someday to learn that we have warned exhorted taught and invited with the help of the Spirit to bless lives with power far beyond our own In addition to the call to teach all of us will be sent by the Lord to succor those in need That is another priesthood service in which we will feel the influence of the Spirit increase our power to serve You will find yourself more able to recognize pain and worry in the faces of people Names or the faces of people in your quorum will come into your mind with the impression that they are in need Bishops have that feeling come to them during the night and each time they sit on the stand looking at the members of their ward or thinking of those who are not there It can happen to them when they find themselves near a hospital or a care center More than once I have heard the words when I walked in the door of a hospital I knew you would come We need not worry about knowing the right thing to say or do when we get there The love of God and the Holy Spirit may be enough When I was a young man I feared that I would not know what to do or to say to people in great need Once I was at the hospital bedside of my father as he seemed near death I heard a commotion among the nurses in the hallway Suddenly President Spencer W Kimball walked into the room and sat in a chair on the opposite side of the bed from me I thought to myself Now here is my chance to watch and listen to a master at going to those in pain and suffering President Kimball said a few words of greeting asked my father if he had received a priesthood blessing and then when Dad said that he had the prophet sat back in his chair I waited for a demonstration of the comforting skills I felt I lacked and so much needed After perhaps five minutes of watching the two of them simply smiling silently at each other I saw President Kimball rise and say Henry I think I ll go before we tire you I thought I had missed the lesson but it came later In a quiet moment with Dad after he recovered enough to go home our conversation turned to the visit by President Kimball Dad said quietly Of all the visits I had that visit I had from him lifted my spirits the most President Kimball didn t speak many words of comfort at least that I could hear but he went with the Spirit of the Lord as his companion to give the comfort I realize now that he was demonstrating the lesson President Monson taught How does one magnify a calling Simply by performing the service that pertains to it That is true whether we are called to teach the gospel by the Spirit or go with the Holy Ghost to those with feeble knees and hands that hang down 7 Our priesthood service will be strengthened people will be blessed and the light of heaven will be there The light of heaven will be there for us as well as for those we serve We may be tired Our own and our family s troubles may loom large But there is a blessing of encouragement for those who serve under the influence of the Spirit President George Q Cannon had more than his fair share of sorrow opposition and trials in his years of priesthood service He also had experience with the Holy Ghost as his companion in difficult times and hard service This is the assurance to us in our priesthood service in the Church and in our families For me the promise has been true when I have felt the Spirit in my priesthood service Whenever darkness fills our minds we may know that we are not possessed of the Spirit of God When we are filled with the Spirit of God we are filled with joy with peace and with happiness no matter what our circumstances may be for it is a spirit of cheerfulness and of happiness The Lord has given unto us the gift of the Holy Ghost It is our privilege to have that Holy Ghost reign within us so that from morning till night and from night till morning we shall have the joy the light and the revelation thereof 8We can watch for that blessing of happiness and joy to come when we need it during the difficult times in our faithful priesthood service I testify that we are called of God by prophecy This is the true Church of Jesus Christ restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith God lives and hears our every prayer Jesus is the resurrected Christ and our Savior You can know these things are true by the power of the Holy Ghost which will come to you in your service In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters it is an honor to address you on this Sabbath day I am humbled by the assignment to speak to the millions of Latter day Saints and our friends across the world In preparation for this sacred opportunity I prayed and pondered to learn about your personal needs and what message the Lord wanted me to give Your needs are great and varied Each of you is a unique child of God God knows you individually He sends messages of encouragement correction and direction fitted to you and to your needs To discover what God would have me add to this conference I read the messages of His servants in scripture and in past conferences I received an answer to my prayer as I read the words of Alma a great servant of the Lord in the Book of Mormon O that I were an angel and could have the wish of mine heart that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God with a voice to shake the earth and cry repentance unto every people Yea I would declare unto every soul as with the voice of thunder repentance and the plan of redemption that they should repent and come unto our God that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth But behold I am a man and do sin in my wish for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me 1And then I found in Alma s reflection the direction for which I had been praying For behold the Lord doth grant unto all nations of their own nation and tongue to teach his word yea in wisdom all that he seeth fit that they should have therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom according to that which is just and true 2As I read that message from a servant of God my errand for today became clear God sends messages and authorized messengers to His children I am to build trust in God and His servants enough that we will go out and obey His counsel He wants that because He loves us and wants our happiness And He knows how a lack of trust in Him brings sadness That lack of trust has brought sorrow to Heavenly Father s children from before the world was created We know through the revelations of God to the Prophet Joseph Smith that many of our brothers and sisters in the premortal world rejected the plan for our mortal life presented by our Heavenly Father and His eldest Son Jehovah 3We don t know all the reasons for Lucifer s terrible success in inciting that rebellion However one reason is clear Those who lost the blessing of coming into mortality lacked sufficient trust in God to avoid eternal misery The sad pattern of lack of trust in God has persisted since the Creation I will be careful in giving examples from the lives of God s children since I do not know all the reasons for their lack of faith enough to trust Him Many of you have studied the moments of crisis in their lives Jonah for instance not only rejected the message from the Lord to go to Nineveh but went the other way Naaman could not trust the direction of the Lord s prophet to bathe in a river to allow the Lord to heal his leprosy feeling the simple task was beneath his dignity The Savior invited Peter to leave the safety of a boat to walk to Him across water We ache for him and see our own need for greater trust in God as we hear the account And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying It is a spirit and they cried out for fear But straightway Jesus spake unto them saying Be of good cheer it is I be not afraid And Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water And he said Come And when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus But when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt 4We can take courage from the fact that Peter came to trust the Lord enough to stay faithful in His service all the way to his martyrdom The young Nephi in the Book of Mormon stirs in us a desire to develop trust in the Lord to obey His commandments however hard they appear to us Nephi faced danger and possible death when he said these words of trust that we can and must feel steadily in our hearts I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them 5That trust comes from knowing God More than any other people on earth we have through the glorious events of the Restoration of the gospel felt the peace that the Lord offered His people with the words Be still and know that I am God 6 My heart is filled with gratitude for what God has revealed about Himself that we might trust Him For me it began in 1820 with a young boy in a grove of trees on a farm in the state of New York The boy Joseph Smith Jr walked among the trees to a secluded spot He knelt to pray with complete trust that God would answer his pleading to know what he should do to be cleansed and saved through the Atonement of Jesus Christ 7Each time I read his account my trust in God and His servants expands I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head above the brightness of the sun which descended gradually until it fell upon me It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air One of them spake unto me calling me by name and said pointing to the other This is My Beloved Son Hear Him 8The Father revealed to us that He lives that Jesus Christ is His Beloved Son and that He loved us enough to send that Son to save us who are His children And because I have a testimony that He called that unlettered boy as an apostle and prophet I trust His apostles and prophets today and those they call to serve God That trust has blessed my life and the lives of my family Years ago I heard President Ezra Taft Benson speak in a conference like this He counseled us to do all we could to get out of debt and stay out He mentioned mortgages on houses He said that it might not be possible but it would be best if we could pay off all our mortgage debt 9I turned to my wife after the meeting and asked Do you think there is any way we could do that At first we couldn t And then by evening I thought of a property we had acquired in another state For years we had tried to sell it without success But because we trusted God and a few words from the midst of His servant s message we placed a phone call Monday morning to the man in San Francisco who had our property listed to sell I had called him a few weeks before and he had said then We haven t had anyone show interest in your property for years But on the Monday after conference I heard an answer that to this day strengthens my trust in God and His servants The man on the phone said I am surprised by your call A man came in today inquiring whether he could buy your property In amazement I asked How much did he offer to pay It was a few dollars more than the amount of our mortgage A person might say that was only a coincidence But our mortgage was paid off And our family still listens for any word in a prophet s message that might be sent to tell what we should do to find the security and peace God wants for us Such trust in God can bless communities as well as families I grew up in a small town in New Jersey Our branch of the Church had fewer than 20 members who regularly attended Among them was a woman an older very humble convert to the Church She was an immigrant who spoke with a heavy Norwegian accent She was the only member of the Church in her family and the only member of the Church in the city in which she lived Through my father who was the branch president the Lord called her as the president of the branch Relief Society She had no handbook to tell her what to do No other member of the Church lived near her She only knew that the Lord cared for those in need and the few words in the motto of the Relief Society Charity never faileth It was in the depths of what we now call the Great Depression Thousands were out of work and homeless So feeling she had her errand from the Lord she asked her neighbors for old clothes She washed the clothes pressed them and put them in cardboard boxes on her back porch When men without money needed clothes and asked her neighbors for help they would say Go to the house down the street There is a Mormon lady living there who will give you what you need The Lord did not run the city but He changed a part of it for the better He called one tiny woman alone who trusted Him enough to find out what He wanted her to do and then did it Because of her trust in the Lord she was able to help in that city hundreds of Heavenly Father s children in need That same trust in God can bless nations I have come to know that we can trust God to fulfill the promise of Alma that behold the Lord doth grant unto all nations of their own nation and tongue to teach his word yea in wisdom all that he seeth fit that they should have 10God does not rule in nations but He is mindful of them He can and does place people in positions of influence who want what is best for the people and who trust in the Lord 11I have seen it in my travels across the world In a city of more than 10 million people I spoke to the Latter day Saints gathered by the thousands in conference It was held in a large sports arena Before the meeting began I noticed a handsome young man sitting on the front row He was surrounded by others who like him were better dressed than most of those around them I asked the General Authority of the Church near me who the men were He whispered that it was the mayor of the city and his staff As I walked to my car after the meeting I was surprised to see the mayor waiting to greet me flanked by his staff He stepped forward extended his hand to me and said I thank you for coming to our city and to our country We are grateful for what you do to build up your people With such people and such families we could create the harmony and the prosperity we want for our people I saw in that moment that he was one of the honest in heart placed by God in power among His children We are a tiny minority among the citizens of that great city and nation The mayor knew little of our doctrine and few of our people Yet God had sent him the message that Latter day Saints under covenant to trust God and His authorized servants would become a light to his people I know the servants of God who will speak to you during this conference They are called of God to give messages to His children The Lord has said of them What I the Lord have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not myself and though the heavens and the earth pass away my word shall not pass away but shall all be fulfilled whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same 12You show your trust in Him when you listen with the intent to learn and repent and then you go and do whatever He asks If you trust God enough to listen for His message in every sermon song and prayer in this conference you will find it And if you then go and do what He would have you do your power to trust Him will grow and in time you will be overwhelmed with gratitude to find that He has come to trust you I testify that God speaks today through His chosen servants in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Thomas S Monson is God s prophet Our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ live and love us I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brethren I am grateful to be with you tonight And I am humbled by what I know of your faithful priesthood service I speak to you tonight of diligence in the Lord s service Recent experiences led me to that choice One was my careful study of the remarkable new booklet for the Aaronic Priesthood about which Brother David L Beck spoke It is entitled Fulfilling My Duty to God As I read and pondered what it expects young men to do and to become I realized that it was describing what President Brigham Young promised to the priesthood holder who is diligent over a lifetime An individual who holds a share in the Priesthood and continues faithful to his calling who delights himself continually in doing the things God requires at his hands and continues through life in the performance of every duty will secure to himself not only the privilege of receiving but the knowledge of how to receive the things of God that he may know the mind of God continually 1Just a few weeks ago I saw a new deacon start on that path of diligence His father showed me a diagram his son had created that showed every row in their chapel a number for each deacon who would be assigned to pass the sacrament and their route through the chapel to serve the sacrament to the members The father and I smiled to think that a boy without being asked to do it would make a plan to be sure he would succeed in his priesthood service I recognized in his diligence the pattern from the new Duty to God booklet It is to learn what the Lord expects of you make a plan to do it act on your plan with diligence and then share with others how your experience changed you and blessed others The deacon made that diagram to be sure that he would be able to do what the Lord had called him to do At the start of his priesthood service the Lord was teaching him to delight in continually doing the things God requires at his hands 2The other experience that led me to speak of diligence to you tonight was watching a man near the end of his priesthood service in this life He had been a bishop twice His first call as a bishop years before I met him had been when he was young Now he was old released for the second time as a bishop His increasing physical limitations made any priesthood service very difficult Yet he had a plan to act in diligence He sat every Sunday he could get to church near the row nearest the door where most of the people would enter for the sacrament meeting He got there early to be sure a seat was vacant Each person arriving could see his look of love and welcome just as they did when he sat on the stand as their bishop His influence warmed and lifted us because we knew something of the price he paid to serve His task as a bishop was finished his priesthood service did not end You have seen such examples of great priesthood servants Tonight I will try to tell you about what I have learned about them It begins with their learning to know whose service they are in and for what purpose When that goes down into their hearts it makes all the difference First I will speak directly to the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood You will become more diligent as you feel the magnitude of the trust God has placed in you There is a message from the First Presidency for you in that Duty to God booklet Heavenly Father has great trust and confidence in you and has an important mission for you to fulfill He will help you as you turn to Him in prayer listen for the promptings of the Spirit obey the commandments and keep the covenants that you have made 3John the Baptist returned to earth to restore the priesthood you young men hold He held the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood It was John to whom Jesus turned to be baptized John knew who called him He said to the Lord I have need to be baptized of thee 4John knew that the priesthood of Aaron holds the keys of the ministering of angels and of the gospel of repentance and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins when the Lord sent him to ordain Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15 1829 5 He knew who called him and for what glorious purpose he was sent Your priesthood allows you to offer the sacrament of the Lord s Supper to the members of His Church today That is the same privilege the Savior granted the Twelve Apostles in His mortal ministry He did it again when He called twelve disciples after His Resurrection to lead His Church The Lord Himself as described in the Book of Mormon provided the emblems of His infinite sacrifice and administered them to the people Think of Him and how He honors you when you perform your priesthood service As you remember Him you will be determined to perform that sacred service as nearly as you can as well and faithfully as He did 6That can become a pattern in your life that will increase your power to be diligent in every priesthood service for which the Lord is preparing you and to which He will call you That determination will help you prepare for receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood which was anciently called the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God 7Now I wish to speak to those who have been called and honored to serve in the Melchizedek Priesthood Like the Aaronic Priesthood the Melchizedek Priesthood is more than a trust to do what the Lord would do It is an invitation to become as He is Here is His promise For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken and the magnifying their calling are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham and the church and kingdom and the elect of God And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me saith the Lord For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father s kingdom therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him 8There is a pattern by which all priesthood holders are lifted to that glorious blessing One place in scripture where the Lord gives the pattern for us is in the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants Wherefore now let every man learn his duty and to act in the office in which he is appointed in all diligence He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand Even so Amen 9We are to learn our duty from the Lord and then we are to act in all diligence never being lazy or slothful The pattern is simple but not easy to follow We are so easily distracted Studying the daily news can appear more interesting than the priesthood lesson manual Sitting down to rest can be more attractive than making appointments to visit those who need our priesthood service When I find myself drawn away from my priesthood duties by other interests and when my body begs for rest I give to myself this rallying cry Remember Him The Lord is our perfect example of diligence in priesthood service He is our captain He called us He goes before us He chose us to follow Him and to bring others with us This evening I remember Him and it stirs my heart This is the Saturday night before Easter Sunday when we remember His Resurrection I remember His example in the days before Out of love for His Father and for us He allowed Himself to suffer beyond the capacity of mortal man He told us some of what that infinite sacrifice required of Him You remember the words For behold I God have suffered these things for all that they might not suffer if they would repent But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I Which suffering caused myself even God the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore and to suffer both body and spirit and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink Nevertheless glory be to the Father and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men 10From the cross on Calvary the Savior announced It is finished 11 Then His spirit left His body and His mortal remains were placed lovingly in a tomb He taught us a lesson by what He did in three days in the spirit world before His Resurrection which I remember whenever I am tempted to feel that I have finished some hard task in His service and deserve a rest The Savior s example gives me courage to press on His labors in mortality were finished but He entered the spirit world determined to continue His glorious work to save souls He organized the work of the faithful spirits to rescue those who could still be made partakers of the mercy made possible by His atoning sacrifice Remember the words from the 138th section of the Doctrine and Covenants But behold from among the righteous he organized his forces and appointed messengers clothed with power and authority and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness even to all the spirits of men and thus was the gospel preached to the dead And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound even unto all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel 12Whenever we remember Him it becomes easier to resist the temptation to want a rest from our priesthood labors We must have remembered Him today and so we are here to learn our duties determined to do what we are covenanted to do in all diligence And because of His example we will endure to the end of the tasks He gives us in this life and be committed to do the will of His Father forever as He was and is This is the Lord s Church He called us and trusted us even in the weaknesses He knew we had He knew the trials we would face By faithful service and through His Atonement we can come to want what He wants and be what we must be to bless those we serve for Him As we serve Him long enough and with diligence we will be changed We can become ever more like Him I have seen evidence of that miracle in the lives of His servants I saw it a few weeks ago in the living room of a faithful priesthood holder I had known him as a deacon a father a bishop and a member of a stake presidency I had observed for decades his diligence in serving God s children with his priesthood His family was gathered around him in his living room He was smiling dressed in a white shirt suit and tie I was surprised since I was there because I had been told that he was in the midst of painful medical treatments that had not yet cured him Yet he had greeted me as he must have greeted hundreds of other visitors over a lifetime of priesthood service smiling I had come to help him in the trials he faced but as so often happens in priesthood service I was helped and I learned We sat and chatted pleasantly He told me how his father had tended to my mother as she approached death I had not known that I realized then that he had learned as a boy from his diligent priesthood father how to give succor That thought made me grateful for the times I had taken my little boys with me on priesthood visits to comfort and bless After a few minutes he asked quietly Would it be appropriate to ask if you could give me a blessing His former stake president with whom he had served for years anointed his head with oil consecrated by the power of the Melchizedek Priesthood As I sealed the blessing I was taught by the Holy Ghost at least part of what the Lord had already done for this faithful priesthood holder He was clean his sins washed away His nature had been changed to want what the Savior wanted He had no fear of death The desire of his heart was to live to give service to his family and to others of Heavenly Father s children who needed him I walked out into the night grateful to have witnessed the Lord s kindness to His unfailingly diligent priesthood servants He changes their hearts to want what He wants and to act as He would act I close now with this counsel to the Lord s priesthood servants Ponder deeply and diligently in the scriptures and in the words of living prophets Persist in prayer for the Holy Ghost to reveal to you the nature of God the Father and His Beloved Son Plead that the Spirit will show you what the Lord wants you to do Plan to do it Promise Him to obey Act with determination until you have done what He asked And then pray to give thanks for the opportunity to serve and to know what you might do next I testify that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ live They are resurrected and glorified beings who love us and watch over us The keys of the priesthood were restored by heavenly messengers to the Prophet Joseph Smith They have been passed in an unbroken line to President Thomas S Monson Those keys are held by each of the living Apostles I leave you my blessing that you may come to feel by the Spirit the magnitude of the trust and promises you have received as ordained priesthood servants in the Lord s true Church in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters our Heavenly Father wants and needs our help to bring His spirit children home to Him again I speak today of young people already within His true Church and so are started on the strait and narrow way to return to their heavenly home He wants them to gain early the spiritual strength to stay on the path And He needs our help to get them back to the path quickly should they begin to wander I was a young bishop when I began to see clearly why the Lord wants us to strengthen children when they are young and rescue them quickly I will tell you one story of a young person who represents many whom I have tried to help over the years She sat across from me at my bishop s desk She spoke to me of her life She had been baptized and confirmed as a member of the Church when she was eight There were no tears in her eyes as she recounted the more than 20 years that followed but there was sadness in her voice She said that the downward spiral began with choices to associate with what she thought were exciting people She began to violate what at first seemed to be less important commandments She felt at first a little sadness and a twinge of guilt But the associations with her friends provided a new feeling of being liked and so her occasional resolutions to repent seemed less and less important As the gravity of the commandments she was breaking increased the dream of a happy eternal home seemed to fade She sat across from me in what she called misery She wanted me to rescue her from the trap of sin in which she found herself bound But the only way out was for her to exercise faith in Jesus Christ to have a broken heart to repent and so be cleansed changed and strengthened through the Lord s Atonement I bore my testimony to her that it was still possible And it was but so much harder than it would have been to exercise faith early in her life on the journey home to God and when she first began to wander So we help God s children best by providing ways to build faith in Jesus Christ and His restored gospel when they are young And then we must help rekindle that faith quickly before it dims as they wander off the path So you and I can expect a nearly continuous opportunity to help travelers among God s children The Savior told us why that would be so when He described the perilous journey home for all of God s spirit children through the mists which sin and Satan create Enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way which leadeth to destruction and many there be who go in thereat Because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it 1Foreseeing the needs of His children a loving Heavenly Father placed directions and rescuers along their way He sent His Son Jesus Christ to make safe passage possible and visible He called as His prophet in these times President Thomas S Monson Since his youth President Monson has taught not only how to stay on the path but also how to rescue those who have been led away into sorrow Heavenly Father has assigned us to a great variety of stations to strengthen and when needed to lead travelers to safety Our most important and powerful assignments are in the family They are important because the family has the opportunity at the start of a child s life to put feet firmly on the path home Parents brothers and sisters grandparents aunts and uncles are made more powerful guides and rescuers by the bonds of love that are the very nature of a family The family has an advantage in the first eight years of a child s life In those protected years because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ Satan s use of the mists of darkness to hide the path to return home is blocked In those precious years the Lord helps families by calling Primary workers to help strengthen children spiritually He also provides holders of the Aaronic Priesthood to offer the sacrament In those sacramental prayers the children hear the promise that they may someday receive the Holy Ghost as a guide if they are obedient to God s commandments As a result they are fortified to resist temptation when it comes and then sometime in the future to go to the rescue of others Many bishops in the Church are inspired to call the strongest people in the ward to serve individual children in the Primary They realize that if the children are strengthened with faith and testimony they will be less likely to need rescue as teenagers They realize that a strong spiritual foundation can make the difference for a lifetime We all can help Grandmothers grandfathers and every member who knows a child can help It doesn t take a formal calling in Primary Nor is it limited by age One such woman as a younger person was on the Primary general board that helped create the CTR motto She never tired of serving the children She taught in the Primary of her ward at her own request until she was almost 90 years old Little children could feel her love for them They saw her example They learned from her the simple principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ And above all because of her example they learned to feel and recognize the Holy Ghost And when they did they were well on their way to the faith to resist temptation They would be less likely to need to be rescued and would be prepared to go to the rescue of others I learned the power of simple faith in prayer and in the Holy Ghost when our children were small Our oldest son was not yet baptized His parents Primary teachers and priesthood servants had tried to help him feel and recognize the Spirit and know how to receive His help One afternoon my wife had taken him to the home of a woman who was teaching him to read Our plan was that I was to pick him up on my way home from work His lesson ended earlier than we had expected He felt confident that he knew the way home So he started to walk He said afterward that he had complete confidence and liked the idea of being alone on the trip After he had gone about half a mile 0 8 km it started to grow dark He began to sense that he was still very far from home He can still remember that the lights of the cars as they streamed past him were blurred by his tears He felt like a little child not the confident boy who had begun to walk home alone He realized that he needed help Then something came to his memory He knew he was supposed to pray And so he left the road and headed toward some trees he could barely see in the darkness He found a place to kneel down Through the bushes he could hear voices coming toward him Two young people had heard him crying As they approached they said Can we help you Through his tears he told them he was lost and that he wanted to go home They asked if he knew his home phone number or address He didn t They asked if he knew his name He did know that They led him to the nearby place where they lived They found our family name in a phone book When I got the phone call I rushed to the rescue grateful that kind people had been placed along his way home And I have been ever grateful he was taught to pray with faith that help would come when he was lost That faith has led him to safety and brought him more rescuers more times than he can count The Lord has placed a pattern of rescue and rescuers in His kingdom In His wisdom the Lord has inspired His servants to place some of the most powerful ways to strengthen us and to put in place the best rescuers as we pass through the teenage years You know of two powerful programs provided by the Lord One for young women is called Personal Progress The other for Aaronic Priesthood holders is called Duty to God We encourage young people in the rising generation to see their own potential to build great spiritual strength And we plead with those who care about those young people to rise to what the Lord requires of us to help them And since the future of the Church depends upon them all of us care The two programs have been improved but their purpose remains unchanged President Monson put it this way we must learn what we should learn do what we should do and be what we should be 2The Personal Progress booklet for young women makes the purpose clear for them The Personal Progress program uses the eight Young Women values to help you understand more fully who you are why you are here on the earth and what you should be doing as a daughter of God to prepare for the day you go to the temple to make sacred covenants It goes on to say that young women will make commitments carry them out and report your progress to a parent or leader It also promises that the patterns you establish as you work on Personal Progress such as prayer scripture study service and journal keeping will become personal daily habits These habits will strengthen your testimony and help you learn and improve throughout your life 3The Duty to God program for young men in the Aaronic Priesthood has been strengthened and focused It will be contained in one simple book for all three Aaronic Priesthood offices The young men and their leaders will receive a copy of this new book It is a powerful tool It will strengthen the testimonies of young men and their relationship with God It will help them learn and want to fulfill their priesthood duties It will strengthen their relationships with their parents among quorum members and with their leaders Both of these programs put great responsibility on the efforts of the young people themselves They are invited to learn and do things that would be challenging for anyone As I reflect on my own youth I cannot remember being so challenged Oh on a few occasions I was invited to rise to such tests but only now and then These programs expect consistency great effort and the accumulation of learning and spiritual experiences over years On reflection I realized that the contents of these booklets are a physical representation of the Lord s trust in the rising generation and in all of us who love them And I have seen evidence that the trust is well placed In visits I watched Aaronic Priesthood quorums in action I have seen young men following patterns of learning making plans to do what God wants of them then moving out to do what they have committed to do and sharing with others how they were changed spiritually And as I watched and listened it became clear that fathers mothers leaders friends and even neighbors in a congregation were touched by the Spirit as they heard youth testify how they had been strengthened The youth were lifted as they bore testimony and so were those who were trying to help them rise The Young Women program has in it that same powerful pattern to develop spiritual strength in the young women and to offer the opportunity for us to help Personal Progress helps young women prepare to receive the ordinances of the temple They are helped by the examples of mothers grandmothers and every righteous woman around them in the Church I have seen how parents helped a daughter achieve her goals and dreams by noticing and appreciating all the good things she does Just a few days ago I watched a mother stand with her young daughter as they received recognition for having together become examples of outstanding womanhood And as they shared with me what it had meant to them I felt the Lord s approval and encouragement for us all Of all the help we can give these young people the greatest will be to let them feel our confidence that they are on the path home to God and that they can make it And we do that best by going with them Because the path is steep and sometimes rocky they will at times feel discouraged and even stumble They may at times become confused about their destination and wander after less eternally important goals These inspired programs make that less likely because they will lead the young person to invite and receive the companionship of the Holy Ghost The best counsel for us to give young people is that they can arrive back to Heavenly Father only as they are guided and corrected by the Spirit of God So if we are wise we will encourage praise and exemplify everything which invites the companionship of the Holy Ghost When they share with us what they are doing and feeling we must ourselves have qualified for the Spirit Then they will feel in our praise and our smiles the approval of God And should we feel the need to give corrective counsel they will feel our love and the love of God in it not rebuke and rejection which can permit Satan to lead them further away The example they most need from us is to do what they must do We need to pray for the gifts of the Spirit We need to ponder in the scriptures and in the words of living prophets We need to make plans which are not only wishes but covenants And then we need to keep our promises to the Lord And we need to lift others by sharing with them the blessings of the Atonement which have come in our lives And we need to exemplify in our own lives the steady and prolonged faithfulness that the Lord expects of them As we do we will help them feel from the Spirit an assurance that if they will persist they will hear the words from a loving Savior and Heavenly Father Well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord 4 And we who help them along the way will hear those words with joy I testify that the Lord loves you and every child of God This is His kingdom restored with priesthood keys through the Prophet Joseph Smith Thomas S Monson is the Lord s prophet today I promise each of you as you follow inspired direction in this the true Church of Jesus Christ that our youth and we who help and love them can be delivered safely to our home with Heavenly Father and the Savior to live in families and in joy forever In the name of Jesus Christ amen

Wherever I am in the day or night there is nearby a small container of olive oil This is the one which I keep in the middle drawer of the desk where I work There is one in my pocket when I am working outdoors or traveling There is also one in the kitchen cabinet in my home The one I hold now has a date on it It is the day when someone exercised the power of the priesthood to consecrate the pure oil for the healing of the sick The young men of the Aaronic Priesthood and even their fathers might think that I am a little extreme in my preparation But the call during the day or the knock at the door at night always comes as a surprise Someone will say Please could you come quickly Once years ago it was a father calling from a hospital His three year old daughter had been thrown 50 feet 15 m by a speeding car as she ran across the street to join her mother When I arrived at the hospital the father pled that the power of the priesthood would preserve her life The doctors and the nurses only reluctantly let us reach through a plastic barrier to place a drop of oil on the one opening in the heavy bandages which covered her head A doctor said to me with irritation in his voice Hurry with whatever you are going to do She is dying He was wrong She lived and contrary to what the doctor had said she not only lived but she learned to walk again When the call came I was ready The preparation was far more than having consecrated oil close at hand It must begin long before the crisis which requires priesthood power Those who are prepared will be ready to answer The preparation begins in families in Aaronic Priesthood quorums and mostly in the private lives of young men The quorums and the families must help but the preparation that counts will be made by the young men making choices to rise to their great destiny as priesthood servants for God The destiny of the rising generation of priesthood holders is far more than to be ready to bring God s power down to heal the sick The preparation is to be ready to go and do whatever the Lord wants done as the world is preparing for His coming None of us knows exactly what those errands will be But we know what it will take to be ready so each of us can prepare What you will need in the dramatic moment will be built in the steady performance of obedient service I will tell you two of the things you will need and the preparation it takes to be ready The first is to have faith The priesthood is the authority to act in the name of God It is the right to call down the powers of heaven So you must have faith that God lives and that you have won His confidence to allow you to use His power for His purposes An instance from the Book of Mormon will help you see how one man made that preparation There was a priesthood holder named Nephi who received a hard assignment from the Lord He was sent by God to call wicked people to repentance before it was too late for them In their wickedness and hatred they were killing each other Even their sorrow had not humbled them enough to repent and obey God Because of Nephi s preparation God blessed him with power to fulfill his assignment In His loving and empowering words to Nephi there is a guide for us Blessed art thou Nephi for those things which thou hast done for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word which I have given unto thee unto this people And thou hast not feared them and hast not sought thine own life but hast sought my will and to keep my commandments And now because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness behold I will bless thee forever and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed in faith and in works yea even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will Behold thou art Nephi and I am God Behold I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels that ye shall have power over this people and shall smite the earth with famine and with pestilence and destruction according to the wickedness of this people Behold I give unto you power that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and thus shall ye have power among this people 1As the account from the Book of Mormon tells us the people did not repent So Nephi asked God to change the seasons He asked for a miracle to help the people choose to repent because of famine The famine came The people repented and then they begged Nephi to have God send rain He did ask God and God honored his unshakable faith That faith did not come in the moment when Nephi needed it nor did God s trust in Nephi He earned that great faith and God s confidence by courageous and sustained labor in the Lord s service You young men are building that faith now for the days ahead when you will need it It may be so small a thing as to keep careful minutes in a deacons or a teachers quorum There were young men years ago who kept meticulous records of what was decided and what was done by boys only months older than they were That took faith that God called even 12 year olds into His service who were being guided by revelation Some of those quorum secretaries of long ago now sit in the presiding councils of the Church They now read the minutes others prepare And revelation flows to them now as it did to the leaders they served when they were boys like you They had been prepared to trust that God reveals His will even in apparently small matters in His kingdom Now the Lord said Nephi could be trusted because he would ask nothing contrary to God s will To have that confidence in Nephi the Lord had to be sure that Nephi believed in revelation sought it and followed it Long experience following inspiration from God was a part of Nephi s priesthood preparation It must be part of yours I see that happening today In recent months I have heard deacons teachers and priests give talks which are clearly as inspired and powerful as you will hear in this general conference As I have felt the power being given to young holders of the priesthood I have thought that the rising generation is rising around us as if on an incoming tide My prayer is that those of us in the generations which have come before will rise on the tide with them The preparation of the Aaronic Priesthood is a blessing to us all as well as to those they will serve in their generation and the generations to follow Yet all is not perfect in Zion Not all of the youth choose to prepare That choice must be their own They are responsible for themselves That is the Lord s way in His loving plan But many young men have little or no support from those who could help as they prepare Those of us who can help will be held accountable by the Lord A father who neglects or interferes with a son s development of faith or his ability to follow inspiration will someday know sorrow That will be true for anyone placed in a position to help these young men choose wisely and well in their days in the preparatory priesthood Now the second thing they will need is confidence that they can live up to the blessings and the trust which God has offered them Most of the influences around them drag them down to doubt the existence of God of His love for them and of the reality of the sometimes quiet messages they receive through the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of Christ Their peers may urge them to choose sin If young men choose sin those messages from God will become more faint We can help them choose to prepare by loving them warning them and by showing confidence in them But we can help them even more by our example of a faithful and inspired servant In our families in quorums in classes and as we associate with them in any setting we can act as true priesthood holders who use its power as God has taught us For me that instruction is most clear in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants The Lord warns us in that section to have our motives pure No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by long suffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned 2 As we lead and influence young men we must never do it to gratify our pride or our ambition We must never use compulsion in any degree of unrighteousness That is a high standard of the example we must set for our youth I saw it done when I was a teacher and a priest My bishop and those who served under him were determined not to lose even one of us As nearly as I could see their determination was motivated by love for the Lord and for us not for any selfish purpose The bishop had a system Every adviser of every quorum was to contact every young man he had not spoken to that Sunday They were not to go to bed until they had either talked to the boy who had been missing to his parents or to a close friend The bishop promised them that he would not turn out his light until he had heard a report about every boy I don t think he gave them an order He simply made it clear that he did not expect their lights to go out until they had given that report He and those who served under him were doing far more than watching over us They were showing us by example what it means to care for the Lord s sheep No effort was too much for him or for those who served us in our quorums By their example they taught us what it means to be unwearying in the Lord s service The Lord was preparing us by example I have no idea whether they thought any one of us was going to be anything special But they treated us as if they did by being willing to pay any personal price to keep us from losing faith I don t know how the bishop got so many people to have such high expectations As nearly as I can tell it was done by persuasion by long suffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned The no lights out method the bishop used would not work in some places But the example of unwavering care for every young man and reaching out quickly brought the power of heaven into our lives It always will It helped young men prepare for the days when God needed them in families and in His kingdom My father was an example for me of what the Lord teaches in the 121st section about getting heaven s help in preparing young men During my early years he was sometimes disappointed by my performance He let me know it Hearing his voice I could feel he thought I was better than that But he did it in the Lord s way Reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the Holy Ghost and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy 3I knew even after the most direct correction that Dad s reproof was given in love In fact his love seemed to increase when he used even his strongest correction which was a disapproving and disappointed look He was my leader and my trainer never using compulsory means and I am sure that the promise given in the Doctrine and Covenants will be fulfilled for him His influence on me will flow unto him forever and ever 4Many fathers and leaders when they hear the words of the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants will feel that they must rise higher to come up to that standard I do Can you remember a moment when you rebuked a child or youth with sharpness when you were moved by something other than inspiration Can you remember a time when you told a son to do something or make a sacrifice you were not willing to do or make yourself Those feelings of regret can spur us to repentance to become more nearly the examples we have covenanted to be As we meet our obligations as fathers and leaders we will help the next generation rise to their glorious future They will be better than we are just as you have tried to be even better parents than your parents and better leaders than the great ones who helped you It is my prayer that we will be determined to do better every day to prepare the rising generation Each time I see a bottle of consecrated oil I will remember this night and the feeling I have now of wanting to do more to help young men prepare for their days of service and opportunity I pray for a blessing of preparation for them I am confident that with the Lord s help and ours they will be ready I bear you my witness that God the Father lives and that Jesus Christ lives and leads this Church He is the perfect exemplar of the priesthood President Thomas S Monson holds and exercises all the keys of the priesthood on the earth That is true I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I feel blessed to have the opportunity to speak with you on this Sabbath day Different as we are in circumstances and experiences we share a desire to become better than we are There may be a few who mistakenly feel they are good enough and a few who have given up trying to be better But for all the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that we can and must expect to become better as long as we live Part of that expectation is set for us in a revelation given by God to the Prophet Joseph Smith It describes the day when we will meet the Savior as we all will It tells us what to do to prepare and what to expect It is in the book of Moroni Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure Amen 1That ought to help you understand why any believing Latter day Saint is an optimist about what lies ahead for him or her however difficult the present may be We believe that through living the gospel of Jesus Christ we can become like the Savior who is perfect Considering the attributes of Jesus Christ should quash the pride of the self satisfied person who thinks he or she has no need to improve And even the most humble person can take hope in the invitation to become like the Savior How that wonderful transformation will happen is captured for me in a song written for children I remember watching the faces of a room full of children singing it on a Sunday Each of the children was leaning forward almost to the front of the chair I could see light in their eyes and determination in their faces as they sang with gusto You may have heard the song too I hope it will sound forever in our memories I only hope I can give it the feeling those children had I m trying to be like Jesus I m following in his ways I m trying to love as he did in all that I do and say At times I am tempted to make a wrong choice But I try to listen as the still small voice whispers Love one another as Jesus loves you Try to show kindness in all that you do Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought For these are the things Jesus taught 2It seemed to me that they were not just singing they were declaring their determination Jesus Christ was their example To be like Him was their fixed goal And their eager looks and their shining eyes convinced me that they had no doubts They expected to succeed They believed that the instruction of the Savior to be perfect was not a hope but a command And they were sure He had prepared the way That determination and confidence can and must be in the heart of every Latter day Saint The Savior has prepared the way through His Atonement and His example And even the children who sang that song knew how Love is the motivating principle by which the Lord leads us along the way towards becoming like Him our perfect example Our way of life hour by hour must be filled with the love of God and love for others There is no surprise in that since the Lord proclaimed those as the first and great commandments It is love of God that will lead us to keep His commandments And love of others is at the heart of our capacity to obey Him Just as Jesus used a child in His mortal ministry as an example for the people of the pure love they must and could have to be like Him He has offered us the family as an example of an ideal setting in which we can learn how to love as He loves That is because the greatest joys and the greatest sorrows we experience are in family relationships The joys come from putting the welfare of others above our own That is what love is And the sorrow comes primarily from selfishness which is the absence of love The ideal God holds for us is to form families in the way most likely to lead to happiness and away from sorrow A man and a woman are to make sacred covenants that they will put the welfare and happiness of the other at the center of their lives Children are to be born into a family where the parents hold the needs of children equal to their own in importance And children are to love parents and each other That is the ideal of a loving family In many of our homes there are the words Our Family Can Be Together Forever There is a gravestone near my home of a mother and grandmother She and her husband were sealed in the temple of God to each other and to their posterity for time and all eternity The inscription on the gravestone reads Please no empty chairs She asked for that inscription because she knew that whether the family will be together depends on the choices each family member makes The word please is there because neither God nor she can compel another to choose happiness And there is Satan who wants misery not happiness in families in this life and in the next My hope today is to suggest some choices which may seem difficult but that would assure you that you have qualified for there to be no empty chairs in your family in the world to come First I give counsel to husbands and wives Pray for the love which allows you to see the good in your companion Pray for the love that makes weaknesses and mistakes seem small Pray for the love to make your companion s joy your own Pray for the love to want to lessen the load and soften the sorrows of your companion I saw this in my parents marriage In my mother s final illness the more uncomfortable she became the more giving her comfort became the dominant intent of my father s life He asked that the hospital set up a bed in her room He was determined to be there to be sure that she wanted for nothing He walked the miles to work each morning and back to her side at night through those difficult times for her I believe it was a gift from God to him that his power to love grew when it mattered so much to her I think he was doing what Jesus would have done out of love Now I give counsel to the parents of a wandering child The Savior is the perfect example of persisting in love You remember His words of comfort to the people among the Nephites who had rejected His earlier invitation to come to Him He spoke to the survivors of the destruction which came after His Crucifixion O ye house of Israel whom I have spared how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart 3The story of the prodigal son gives us all hope The prodigal remembered home as will your children They will feel your love drawing them back to you Elder Orson F Whitney in a general conference of 1929 gave a remarkable promise which I know is true to the faithful parents who honor the temple sealing to their children Though some of the sheep may wander the eye of the Shepherd is upon them and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold Then he goes on to say Pray for your careless and disobedient children hold on to them with your faith Hope on trust on till you see the salvation of God 4 You can pray for your children love them and reach out to them with confidence that Jesus reaches for them with you When you keep trying you are doing what Jesus does Now here is my counsel to children The Lord gave you a commandment with a promise Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee 5 It is the only one of the Ten Commandments with a promise You may not have parents that are living In some cases you may not feel that your parents are worthy of the honor and respect of their children You may not even have ever known them But you owe them life And in every case even if your life is not lengthened its quality will be improved simply by remembering your parents with honor Now to those who have adopted other people s families as if they were their own I have friends who remember my children s birthdays better than I do My wife and I have had friends who seldom failed to visit or to remember a holiday with us I often am touched when someone begins a conversation How is your family and then waits to hear the answer with love showing in their face They seem attentive when I go through a description of the life of each of my children Their love helps me to feel more keenly the love of the Savior for our children In their question I can sense that they are feeling what Jesus feels and asking what He would ask For all of us it may be hard to see in our lives an increasing power to love and to see ourselves becoming more like the Savior our perfect example I wish to encourage you You have had evidences that you are moving along the road to becoming more like Jesus It will help to remember how you have felt at times like a little child even in the midst of cares and trials Think of those children singing the song Think of the times you felt perhaps recently as those little children did singing I m trying to be like Jesus I m following in his ways You will remember that Jesus asked His disciples to bring the children to Him and said Suffer the little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of God 6 You have felt the peace of a pure little child at times when you have tried to be like Jesus It may have come when you were baptized He did not need baptism because He was pure But when you were baptized you had the feeling of being washed clean like a little child When He was baptized the heavens were opened and He heard the voice of His Heavenly Father This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased 7 You heard no voice but you felt the approval of Heavenly Father for having done what Jesus did You have felt it in your family when you asked the pardon of your spouse or forgave a child for some mistake or disobedience These moments will come more often as you try to do the things you know Jesus would do Because of His Atonement for you your childlike obedience will bring a feeling of love of the Savior for you and your love for Him That is one of the gifts that is promised to His faithful disciples And this gift can come not only to you alone but also to the loving members of your family The promise was given in 3 Nephi And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the peace of thy children 8I hope you will go out today looking for opportunities to do as He did and to love as He loves I can promise you the peace that you felt as a child will come to you often and it will linger with you The promise is true that He made to His disciples Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you 9None of us is perfect yet But we can have frequent assurance that we are following along the way He leads us and He beckons for us to follow Him I testify that the way lies in faith in Jesus Christ in baptism in receiving the Holy Ghost and in enduring in love to keep His commandments I testify that the Father lives and loves us He loves His Beloved Son the Lord Jesus Christ who is our perfect example Joseph Smith was the prophet of the Restoration He saw the Father and the Son I know that is true There is in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints the priesthood power to offer the ordinances that allow us to become better and better and more like the Savior and our Heavenly Father I leave you my blessing that you may feel the assurance and the approval you felt as a little child In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be with you tonight I express to you the love and the gratitude of President Monson and President Uchtdorf From its founding in 1842 the Relief Society has been blessed by the careful and loving oversight of the prophet of God At the start in Nauvoo Joseph Smith instructed the leaders and the assembled members Knowing that you have that glorious history I felt the weight of this invitation from President Monson to speak to you In one of those early meetings of the society the Prophet Joseph Smith surprised Bishop Newel K Whitney by asking him to speak in his place Bishop Whitney said that he had arrived in happy anticipation of being taught by the Prophet I understand his feelings of disappointment and perhaps yours And so I asked President Monson as I was preparing for this hour what he felt would be most helpful for you to hear What he said confirmed the impressions which had already come as I studied and prayed I will speak to you tonight of the great legacy those who went before you in the Relief Society have passed on to you The part of the foundation they laid for you which seems to me most important and persistent is that charity is at the heart of the society and is to come into the heart to be part of the very nature of every member Charity meant to them far more than a feeling of benevolence Charity is born of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and is an effect of His Atonement working in the hearts of the members There are many benevolent groups of women who do great good There are many who have overpowering feelings of sympathy for the unfortunate the sick and the needy But this organization is unique and has been from its start In the foundation they created those great sisters set charity never faileth 1 at the center It served them at the beginning it served them in the great period that followed it serves them now in a new time and it will serve the Relief Society in all the periods ahead This society is composed of women whose feelings of charity spring from hearts changed by qualifying for and by keeping covenants offered only in the Lord s true Church Their feelings of charity come from Him through His Atonement Their acts of charity are guided by His example and come out of gratitude for His infinite gift of mercy and by the Holy Spirit which He sends to accompany His servants on their missions of mercy Because of that they have done and are able to do uncommon things for others and to find joy even when their own unmet needs are great The history of the Relief Society is filled with accounts of such remarkable selfless service In the terrible days of persecution and deprivation as the faithful moved from Ohio to Missouri to Illinois and then across the deserts going west the sisters in their poverty and sorrows cared for others You would weep as I did if I now read to you some of the accounts in your history You would be touched by their generosity but even more by your recognition of the faith which lifted and sustained them They came from a great diversity of circumstances All faced the universal trials and heartaches of life Their determination born of faith to serve the Lord and others seemed to take them not around the storms of life but directly into them Some were young and some old They were from many lands and peoples as you are today But they were of one heart one mind and with one intention They were determined to help the Lord build His Zion where there could be the happy existence the Book of Mormon had described so vividly for them You remember some of the scenes from 4 Nephi which they carried in their hearts wherever the Lord led them on the journey to Zion And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year the people were all converted unto the Lord upon all the face of the land both Nephites and Lamanites and there were no contentions and disputations among them and every man did deal justly one with another And they had all things common among them therefore there were not rich and poor bond and free but they were all made free and partakers of the heavenly gift And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people 2The early members of Relief Society did not enter such an idyllic time But the love of God dwelt in their hearts So it and they endured during the journey west and in the years that followed Because of hard circumstances for nearly four decades the Relief Society ceased to function as a Churchwide organization But in 1868 Brigham Young called Eliza R Snow to assist bishops in organizing Relief Societies She was called as the second general president of the Relief Society in 1880 The record of Relief Society shows that when the leaders approached the sisters across the Church to begin again formal Relief Society work they found that charity in their hearts was undiminished They had continued to reach out in mercy to those in need For those who stayed faithful to their covenants the gift of charity the pure love of Christ had endured It was still theirs In the years that followed the Relief Society grew in numbers and in power to serve those in need Under the leadership of women of great vision and capacity the Relief Society took the lead in starting charitable services which did not exist on the frontier for those in need They created a small hospital They supported women in going to the East to get medical training to staff it That was the beginning of one of the great hospital systems in the United States They began programs which became over the years the worldwide LDS Family Services programs They created a grain storage system so effective that they could respond to a request for help from the federal government in a time of war and crisis They began what became the Primary and what became the organization for young women in the Church They created their own magazine for women They became one of the largest organizations for women in the world They were also in the leadership of organizations for women in the United States The Relief Society was at the heart of the beginning of the Church s power to give humanitarian aid across the world Leaders of nations when they visit Utah express awe and admiration for what the Church is doing for the poor and the victims of war and natural disaster across the world Those remarkable gifts to the children of God are part of the enduring legacy of Relief Society The Prophet Joseph Smith told the Relief Society in their first meetings that such remarkable things would come from their faithful service He said that queens would come to learn from and be part of their service 3 I have seen that prophecy fulfilled And I can discern from the records that a scriptural promise to those who serve the Lord in His work was also granted to those Relief Society pioneers That promise given through the Prophet Joseph Smith is recorded in the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants It speaks of those who will be called to serve with the Lord in successive seasons And he said unto the first Go ye and labor in the field and in the first hour I will come unto you and ye shall behold the joy of my countenance And he said unto the second Go ye also into the field and in the second hour I will visit you with the joy of my countenance And also unto the third saying I will visit you And unto the fourth and so on unto the twelfth And the lord of the field went unto the first in the first hour and tarried with him all that hour and he was made glad with the light of the countenance of his lord 4It is clear from the record they left that those women of the first period of Relief Society felt the joy the Lord promised He was in the work with them He prospered it and they felt joy and light But the Prophet Joseph foresaw that another season would follow He saw the grand works they would build in the first season But he also said that they were to serve bless and care for those close to them known personally by them After a joyful time of service for the Relief Society the Lord led them into another season away from the fields they had planted so magnificently It was hard for the faithful men who inherited for instance the hospital system they had expanded on the foundation the Relief Society had built The Lord through His prophets made clear that His priesthood servants could hand the trust of maintaining and building that powerful instrument for good to others And so the Church gave away its marvelous hospital system I know and admire the men who had felt the joy of service in that hospital system And I saw their recognition that the joy had come from being at work with the Lord not from their own accomplishments So they smiled and gave away gladly what they had built They had faith that the Lord saw a greater need for their service elsewhere in other fields in another season A precious part of your Relief Society heritage is that same faith in the hearts of the leaders and the members of the Relief Society The Lord had known where their great talents would be needed in the next season and where they would find an even greater joy than in the wonderful benevolent enterprises they had begun and built The Church grew larger and reached across the world The services the Relief Society had created began to require massive resources and constant oversight in an expanding Church and a world with increasing turmoil Running large and centralized programs would have lessened the opportunity of Relief Society leaders and members to feel the joy of serving individuals for and with the Lord For a new season the Lord had their opportunity already in place The only system which could provide succor and comfort across a church so large in a world so varied would be through individual servants near the people in need The Lord had seen that coming from the beginning of Relief Society He set a pattern in place Two Relief Society sisters accept their assignment to visit another as a call from the Lord That was true from the start Relief Society officers organized members who they knew had faith to give compassionate service when it was beyond the power of two assigned visiting teachers It was always close to home among acquaintances Members teach the gospel in local meetings and bear testimony of the Savior and of the Restoration Daughters watch over mothers Mothers listen to teach and care for daughters The members of Relief Society have always been trusted by local priesthood shepherds Every bishop and every branch president has a Relief Society president to depend upon She has visiting teachers who know the trials and the needs of every sister She can through them know the hearts of individuals and families She can meet needs and help the bishop in his call to nurture individuals and families A wonderful part of the heritage of Relief Society is evident in the way the priesthood has always shown respect to and received it from the Relief Society in turn I have seen it as you have My family s bishop said to me years ago with a smile Why is it that when I go to someone in the ward in need your wife always seems to have been there ahead of me Every bishop and branch president with any experience at all has felt the gentle prod of inspired example from the sisters of the Relief Society They help us remember that for all both women and men there will be no salvation without compassionate service You who are older remember President Marion G Romney quoting this scripture when he said he was as determined as were the sisters to be faithful in providing that compassionate service He quoted King Benjamin And now for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you that is for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day that ye may walk guiltless before God I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor every man according to that which he hath such as feeding the hungry clothing the naked visiting the sick and administering to their relief both spiritually and temporally according to their wants 5The reason President Romney smiled if I remember when he did it was he said he did really want to have his sins remitted And so he thought he would join the sisters in every act of compassionate service he could Now it s time to talk about what you must do to pass this marvelous and sacred legacy of Relief Society on to those who will follow you It will take small and simple things Just remember that the legacy is passed from heart to heart Charity the pure love of Christ is part of the mighty change of heart which the Lord promises to His faithful disciples So it is not hard to see what simple things you can and must do to pass the legacy along For instance each time you and your companion prepare to go visiting teaching you just need to remember what success will be It will be more than getting in the door It will be more than giving a message It will be more than asking how you can help Success will come perhaps only after many visits And you may not in this world see the evidence that you have succeeded But you can feel by the Spirit if you are on the way I talked with a Relief Society member about a visit she had made It was to a woman who would soon lose her husband suddenly and tragically In recent years the woman had only intermittent contact with Relief Society The visitor prepared by stopping at a shop to buy flowers It was a season when the tulips were stacked for sale in many colors She chose one color her favorite but then felt impressed to try another She didn t know why she selected yellow but she did When she presented the yellow tulips at the door the woman smiled and said Come See my backyard garden It was filled with yellow tulips in full bloom The woman said I was just wondering if I should cut some for the house But now I can leave them and enjoy them a little longer in my garden because you brought me these They chatted pleasantly as if they were old friends From that impression to bring some flowers and to choose yellow tulips that visiting teacher had evidence that she was on the Lord s errand When she told me I could hear the joy in her voice When she spoke with me she didn t know what the widow felt after the visit But if the widow felt that God loved her and that He had sent an angel to her the visiting teacher had helped her move down the road to success in the Lord s eyes That visitor may verify success from her faithful effort only in the world to come That is true for two visiting teachers who again and again brought love to another widow living nearby in a nursing home for nearly nine years After hard trials she passed away just weeks ago From what I learned from a son of the widow I am confident that those teachers succeeded They will have the happy experience the Prophet Joseph Smith s mother described to the sisters in a meeting of the society which she attended She said We must cherish and watch over one another comfort one another and gain instruction that we may all sit down in heaven together 6You pass the heritage along as you help others receive the gift of charity in their hearts They will then be able to pass it to others The history of Relief Society is recorded in words and numbers but the heritage is passed heart to heart That is why families are such beneficiaries of Relief Society My mother left me a little pin with the words Charity Never Faileth on it Sister Beck gave me this small one for my lapel The enduring legacy my mother left her family was more than the pin It was her love and the Lord s love which I saw and felt in the simple things she did giving compassion for Him She was a Relief Society woman My mother had no daughters but my wife has passed the heritage to our two daughters And they will keep it alive in the hearts of others It will endure because charity never faileth I testify that charity is the pure love of Christ He lives As we serve others with Him we feel His joy By His Atonement He made it possible for us to plead for and receive the gift of charity I know that the Father lives and answers our prayers You are members of a society founded and set on its course by the Prophet of the Restoration Joseph Smith Sister Beck and her counselors were called through inspiration from God which was given to a living prophet I know that is true You have a glorious heritage I pray to God that He will inspire you to preserve it and pass it on as a legacy to bless and bring joy to those in the generations and the seasons to come In the sacred name of Jesus Christ whom we serve amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters this opportunity to speak to you is a great and sacred privilege I pray that my words may be helpful and give you encouragement With all the differences in our lives we have at least one challenge in common We all must deal with adversity There may be periods sometimes long ones when our lives seem to flow with little difficulty But it is in the nature of our being human that comfort gives way to distress periods of good health come to an end and misfortunes arrive Particularly when the comfortable times have gone on for a while the arrival of suffering or the loss of material security can bring fear and sometimes even anger The anger comes at least in part from a feeling that what is happening is unfair The good health and the serene sense of being secure can become to seem deserved and natural When they vanish a feeling of injustice can come Even a brave man I knew wept and cried out in his physical suffering to those who ministered to him I have always tried to be good How could this happen That aching for an answer to How could this happen becomes even more painful when those struggling include those we love And it is especially hard for us to accept when those afflicted seem to us to be blameless Then the distress can shake faith in the reality of a loving and all powerful God Some of us have seen such doubt come to infect a whole generation of people in times of war or famine Such doubt can grow and spread until some may turn away from God whom they charge with being indifferent or cruel And if unchecked those feelings can lead to loss of faith that there is a God at all My purpose today is to assure you that our Heavenly Father and the Savior live and that They love all humanity The very opportunity for us to face adversity and affliction is part of the evidence of Their infinite love God gave us the gift of living in mortality so that we could be prepared to receive the greatest of all the gifts of God which is eternal life Then our spirits will be changed We will become able to want what God wants to think as He thinks and thus be prepared for the trust of an endless posterity to teach and to lead through tests to be raised up to qualify to live forever in eternal life It is clear that for us to have that gift and to be given that trust we must be transformed through making righteous choices where that is hard to do We are prepared for so great a trust by passing through trying and testing experiences in mortality That education can come only as we are subject to trials while serving God and others for Him In this education we experience misery and happiness sickness and health the sadness from sin and the joy of forgiveness That forgiveness can come only through the infinite Atonement of the Savior which He worked out through pain we could not bear and which we can only faintly comprehend It will comfort us when we must wait in distress for the Savior s promised relief that He knows from experience how to heal and help us The Book of Mormon gives us the certain assurance of His power to comfort And faith in that power will give us patience as we pray and work and wait for help He could have known how to succor us simply by revelation but He chose to learn by His own personal experience Here is the account from Alma And he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities Now the Spirit knoweth all things nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people so that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance and now behold this is the testimony which is in me 1Even when you feel the truth of that capacity and kindness of the Lord to deliver you in your trials it may still test your courage and strength to endure The Prophet Joseph Smith cried out in agony in a dungeon O God where art thou And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place How long shall thy hand be stayed and thine eye yea thy pure eye behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants and thine ear be penetrated with their cries 2The Lord s reply has helped me and can encourage us all in times of darkness Here it is My son peace be unto thy soul thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment And then if thou endure it well God shall exalt thee on high thou shalt triumph over all thy foes Thy friends do stand by thee and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands Thou art not yet as Job thy friends do not contend against thee neither charge thee with transgression as they did Job 3I have seen faith and courage come from a testimony that it is true that we are being prepared for eternal life The Lord will rescue His faithful disciples And the disciple who accepts a trial as an invitation to grow and therefore qualify for eternal life can find peace in the midst of the struggle I spoke recently to a young father who has lost his job in the recent economic crisis He knows that hundreds of thousands of people with exactly his skills are looking desperately for work to feed their families His quiet confidence led me to ask him what he had done to become so confident that he would find a way to support his family He said he had examined his life to be sure that he had done all he could to be worthy of the Lord s help It was clear that his need and his faith in Jesus Christ were leading him to be obedient to God s commandments when it is hard to do He said that he saw that opportunity as he and his wife were reading in Alma where the Lord had prepared a people to find the gospel through adversity You remember the moment when Alma turned to the man who led the people in distress The man told him that they had been persecuted and rejected for their poverty And the record goes And now when Alma heard this he turned him about his face immediately towards him and he beheld with great joy for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them and that they were in a preparation to hear the word Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude but he stretched forth his hand and cried unto those whom he beheld who were truly penitent and said unto them I behold that ye are lowly in heart and if so blessed are ye 4The scripture goes on to praise those of us who prepared for adversity in the more prosperous times Many of you had the faith to try to qualify for the help you now need before the crisis came Alma continued Yea he that truly humbleth himself and repenteth of his sins and endureth to the end the same shall be blessed yea much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty 5That young man with whom I spoke recently was one who had done more than put away food and a little savings for the misfortune which living prophets had warned would come He had begun to prepare his heart to be worthy of the Lord s help which he knew he would in the near future need When I asked his wife on the day he lost his job if she was worried she said with cheerfulness in her voice No we ve just come from the bishop s office We are full tithe payers Now it is still too early to tell but I felt assured as they seemed to be assured Things will work out Tragedy did not erode their faith it tested it and strengthened it And the feeling of peace the Lord has promised has already been delivered in the midst of the storm Other miracles are sure to follow The Lord always suits the relief to the person in need to best strengthen and purify him or her Often it will come in the inspiration to do what might seem especially hard for the person who needs help himself One of the great trials of life is losing to death a beloved husband or wife President Hinckley described the hurt when Sister Hinckley was no longer at his side The Lord knows the needs of those separated from loved ones by death He saw the pain of widows and knew of their needs from His earthly experience He asked a beloved Apostle from the agony of the cross to care for His widowed mother who would now lose a son He now feels the needs of husbands who lose their wives and the needs of wives who are left alone by death Most of us know widows who need attention What touches me is to hear as I have of an older widow whom I was intending to visit again having been inspired to visit a younger widow to comfort her A widow needing comfort herself was sent to comfort another The Lord helped and blessed two widows by inspiring them to encourage each other So He gave succor to them both The Lord sent help in that same way to the humble poor in Alma 34 who had responded to the teaching and testimony of His servants Once they had repented and were converted they were still poor But He sent them to do for others what they might reasonably have thought was beyond them and which they still needed They were to give others what they would have hoped He would give them Through His servant the Lord gave these poor converts this hard task After ye have done all these things if ye turn away the needy and the naked and visit not the sick and afflicted and impart of your substance if ye have to those who stand in need I say unto you if ye do not any of these things behold your prayer is vain and availeth you nothing and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith 6That may seem much to ask of people in such great need themselves But I know one young man who was inspired to do that very thing early in his marriage He and his wife were barely getting by on a tiny budget But he saw another couple even poorer than they were To the surprise of his wife he gave help to them from their scanty finances A promised blessing of peace came while they were still in their poverty The blessing of prosperity beyond their fondest dreams came later And the pattern of seeing someone in need someone with less or in pain has never ceased There is yet another trial which when endured well can bring blessings in this life and blessings forever Age and illness can test the best of us My friend served as our bishop when my daughters were still at home They speak of what they felt when he bore his simple testimony around campfires in the mountains He loved them and they knew it He was released as our bishop He had served as a bishop before in another state Those I have met who were from his earlier ward remember him as my daughters do I visited him in his home from time to time to thank him and to give him priesthood blessings His health began a slow decline I can t remember all the ailments he suffered He needed surgery He was in constant pain Yet every time I visited him to give him comfort he turned the tables I always was the one comforted His back and legs forced him to use a cane to walk Yet there he was in church always sitting near the door where he could greet those arriving early with a smile I will never forget the feeling of wonder and admiration which came over me when I opened the back door at home and saw him coming up our driveway It was the day we put out our garbage cans to be picked up by city workers I had put the can out in the morning But there he was dragging my garbage can up the hill with one hand while he balanced himself with a cane in his other hand He was giving me the help he thought I needed when he needed it far more than I did And he was helping with a smile and without being asked I visited him when he finally had to be cared for by nurses and doctors He was lying in a hospital bed still in pain and still smiling His wife had called me to say that he was getting weaker My son and I gave him a priesthood blessing as he lay in the bed with tubes and bottles connected to him I sealed the blessing with a promise that he would have time and the strength to do all that God had for him to do in this life to pass every test He stretched out his hand to grasp mine as I stepped away from his bed to leave I was surprised at the strength of his grip and the firmness in his voice when he said I m going to make it I left thinking that I would see him again soon But the phone call came within a day He was gone to the glorious place where he will see the Savior who is his perfect judge and will be ours As I spoke at his funeral I thought of the words of Paul when he knew that he would go to that place where my neighbor and friend has gone But watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry For I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing 7I have confidence that my neighbor made it through his trial and will face his judge with a joyous smile I bear you my testimony that God the Father lives He set a course for each of us that can polish and perfect us to be with Him I testify that the Savior lives His Atonement makes possible our being purified as we keep His commandments and our sacred covenants And I know from my own experience that He can and will give us strength to rise through every trial President Monson is the Lord s prophet He holds all the keys of the priesthood This is the Lord s true Church in which we are with Him lifting each other and being blessed to succor the fellow sufferers He places in our way In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful for the honor and the blessing of speaking to the priesthood of God My purpose tonight is to help you to be brave and bold in your priesthood service You will need bravery and you will need boldness because you are enlisted in the Lord s army in the last dispensation This is not a time of peace That has been so since Satan arrayed his forces against our Heavenly Father s plan in the premortal existence We don t know the details of the combat then But we know one result Satan and his followers were cast down into the earth And since the creation of Adam and Eve the conflict has continued We have seen it intensify And the scriptures suggest that the war will become more violent and the spiritual casualties on the Lord s side will mount Almost all of us have seen a battlefield portrayed in a film or read the description in a story Over the din of explosions and the shouts of soldiers there comes a cry Man down When that cry sounds faithful fellow soldiers will move toward the sound Another soldier or a medic will ignore danger and move to the injured comrade And the man down will know that help will come Whatever the risk someone will run low or crawl to get there in time to protect and give aid That is true in every band of men joined in a difficult and dangerous mission which they are determined to fulfill at any sacrifice The histories of such groups are full of stories of those loyal men who were determined that no man would be left behind Here is one instance from an official account 1 During fighting in Somalia in October of 1993 two United States Army Rangers in a helicopter during the firefight learned that two other helicopters near them had fallen to the earth The two rangers in their relative safety aloft learned by radio that no ground forces were available to rescue one of the downed aircrews Growing numbers of the enemy were closing in on the crash site The two men watching from above volunteered to go down to the ground the words they used on the radio were to be inserted to protect their critically wounded comrades Their request was denied because the situation was so dangerous They asked a second time Permission was again denied Only after their third request were they put down on the ground Armed only with their personal weapons they fought their way to the crashed helicopter and the injured fliers They moved through intense small arms fire as enemies converged on the crash site They pulled the wounded from the wreckage They put themselves in a perimeter around the wounded placing themselves in the most dangerous positions They protected their comrades until their ammunition was depleted and they were fatally wounded Their bravery and their sacrifice saved the life of a pilot who would have been lost They were each awarded posthumously the Medal of Honor their nation s highest recognition for bravery in the face of an armed enemy The citation reads that what they did was above and beyond the call of duty But I wonder if they saw it that way as they moved to the downed airmen Out of loyalty they felt a duty to stand by their fellow soldiers whatever the cost The courage to act and their selfless service came from feeling that they were responsible for the lives the happiness and the safety of comrades Such a feeling of responsibility for others is at the heart of faithful priesthood service Our comrades are being wounded in the spiritual conflict around us So are the people we are called to serve and protect from harm Spiritual wounds are not easily visible except with inspired eyes But bishops branch presidents and mission presidents sitting before fellow disciples of the Savior can see the wounded and the wounds It has happened for years and across the earth I remember as a bishop looking out at the face and the posture of a young man of the priesthood and having the thought come to my mind so clearly that it seemed audible I need to see him and soon Something is happening He needs help I would never put off such an impression because I had learned that the wounds of sin are often not felt at first by the one being hurt Satan seems sometimes to inject something to deaden the spiritual pain while inflicting the wound Unless something happens soon to begin repentance the wound can worsen and widen Consequently as a priesthood holder responsible for the spiritual survival of some of Heavenly Father s children you will then move to help without waiting for a cry Man down Even a best friend or other leaders or parents may not see what you have seen You may have been the only one to sense by inspiration the warning cry The others may feel as you will be tempted to think Maybe the trouble I thought I saw is just my imagination What right do I have to judge another It s not my responsibility I ll leave it alone until he asks for help Only an authorized judge in Israel is given the power and the responsibility to verify that there is a serious wound to explore it and then under inspiration from God to prescribe the necessary treatment for healing to begin Yet you are under covenant to go to a spiritually wounded child of God You are responsible to be brave enough and bold enough not to turn away I need to explain as best I can at least two things First why do you have a responsibility to move to help your wounded friend And second how do you meet that responsibility First you are under covenant as has been made clear to you that when you accepted the trust from God to receive the priesthood you accepted a responsibility for whatever you might do or fail to do for the salvation of others however difficult and dangerous that might appear to be for you There are countless examples of priesthood holders who shouldered that grave responsibility as you and I must This is how Jacob in the Book of Mormon described his sacred trust when he moved in difficult circumstances to give aid Now my beloved brethren I Jacob according to the responsibility which I am under to God to magnify mine office with soberness and that I might rid my garments of your sins I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God 2Now you might object that Jacob was a prophet and you are not But your office whatever it is in the priesthood brings with it an obligation to lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 3 of those around you You are the Lord s servant covenanted to do for others as best you can what He would do Your great opportunity and your responsibility are described in Ecclesiastes Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labour For if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up 4From that you will understand the true and sobering words from Joseph Smith None but fools will trifle with the souls of men 5 As Jacob believed the woe of any fallen man or woman he could have helped and did not would become his own sorrow Your happiness and that of those you are called to serve as a priesthood holder are bound together Now we come to the question of how best to help those you are called to serve and rescue That will depend on your capacities and on the nature of your priesthood relationship to the person who is in spiritual peril Let me give three cases which may be your opportunity at times in your priesthood service Let s start when you are an inexperienced junior companion a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood assigned with a seasoned companion to visit a young family Before preparing for the visit you will pray for strength and inspiration to see their needs and know what help you could give If you can you will have that prayer with your companion naming those you will visit As you pray your heart will be drawn out to them personally and to God You and your companion will agree on what you hope to accomplish You will work out a plan for what you will do Whatever the plan you will watch and listen with great intensity and humility during the visit You are young and inexperienced But the Lord knows their spiritual state and their needs perfectly He loves them And because you know He sends you to act for Him you can have faith that you can sense their needs and what you can do to meet your charge to help It will come as you visit face to face in their home That is why you have this priesthood charge in the Doctrine and Covenants Visit the house of each member and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties 6And then you have an added charge which takes even greater discernment The teacher s duty is to watch over the church always and be with and strengthen them And see that there is no iniquity in the church neither hardness with each other neither lying backbiting nor evil speaking And see that the church meet together often and also see that all the members do their duty 7You and your companion will rarely receive inspiration to know the details of the degree to which they are meeting that standard But I can promise you from experience that you will be given the gift to know what is well with them And from that you will be able to encourage them There is another promise I can make you and your companion will be inspired to know what changes they could make to begin the spiritual healing they need The words of what you are charged to have happen in their lives will almost certainly contain some of the most important changes the Lord would have them make If your companion feels an impression to urge change watch what he does You will likely be surprised at the way the Spirit guides him to speak There will be the sound of love in his voice He will find a way to tie the needed change with a blessing that will follow If it is the father or mother who needs to make a change he may show how it would lead to happiness for the children He will describe the change as a move away from unhappiness to a better and safer place Your contribution during the visit may seem to you small but it can be more powerful than you may think possible You will show by your face and manner that you care for the people They will see that your love for them and the Lord makes you unafraid And you will be bold enough to bear your testimony to truth Your humble simple and perhaps brief testimony may touch the heart of a person more easily than that of your more experienced companion I have seen it happen Whatever part you play in that priesthood visit your desire to go to the people for the Lord to help them will bring at least two blessings First you will feel the love of God for the people you visit And second you will feel the Savior s gratitude for your desire to give the help the Savior knew they needed He sent you to them because He trusted that you would go feeling responsible to urge them toward Him and toward happiness As you grow a little older there is another opportunity which will come to you in priesthood service You will come to know your fellow quorum members well You may have played basketball or football or shared some youth activities and service projects With some you will have become close friends You will have come to recognize when they are happy and when they are sad Neither of you may be in a position of authority in the quorum But you will feel responsible for your fellow member in the priesthood He may confide in you that he is beginning to break a commandment which you know will do him spiritual harm He may ask for advice because he trusts you I can tell you from experience that if you succeed in influencing him away from a dangerous path you will never forget the joy which came from being his true friend If you do not succeed I promise that when his grief and sadness come as they will you will feel his pain as if it were your own Yet if you tried to help you will still be his friend And in fact for years he may talk with you about what good things there might have been and how grateful he is that you cared enough to try You will comfort him then and invite him again as you did in your youth to come back to the happiness which the Atonement still makes possible for him Now later in your life you will be a father a priesthood father What you have learned in your priesthood service as you helped others away from sadness and toward happiness will give you the power you will need and want Years of being responsible for the souls of men will prepare you for helping and protecting your family whom you will love more than you can imagine in your youth You will know how to lead them with priesthood power to safety My prayer is that you will have joy in your priesthood service throughout your life and forever I pray that you will develop the bravery and love for Heavenly Father s children that led the sons of Mosiah to plead for the chance to face death and danger to take the gospel to a hardened people Their desire and their bravery came from feeling responsible for the eternal happiness of strangers in danger of eternal misery 8May we have a part of the desire which Jehovah had in the world before this one when He asked to come down from the realms of glory to serve us and give His life for us He asked His Father Send me 9I testify that you were called of God and you are sent to serve His children He wants that no one be left behind President Monson holds the keys of the priesthood in all the earth God will give you inspiration and strength to meet your charge to help His children find their way to the happiness made possible by the Atonement of Jesus Christ I so testify to you in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen

My beloved brothers and sisters it is a joy to be gathered with you on this Sabbath morning We live in many different circumstances We will come from every nation and many ethnic backgrounds into the kingdom of God And that prophesied gathering will accelerate We see increased conflict between peoples in the world around us Those divisions and differences could infect us That is why my message of hope today is that a great day of unity is coming The Lord Jehovah will return to live with those who have become His people and will find them united of one heart unified with Him and with our Heavenly Father You have heard that message of unity from me more than once I may well speak of it in the future I have heard it from every prophet of God in my lifetime A plea for unity was the last message I remember from President David O McKay The Lord s prophets have always called for unity The need for that gift to be granted to us and the challenge to maintain it will grow greater in the days ahead in which we will be prepared as a people for our glorious destiny My message is that we are doing better Fathers and mothers are pleading for unity in their homes and those prayers are being answered Families are praying together night and morning I was invited to kneel at bedtime with a family when I was a guest in their home The smallest child was asked to be voice He prayed like a patriarch for every person in the family by name I opened my eyes for an instant to see the faces of the other children and the parents I could tell that they were joining their faith and their hearts in that little boy s prayer Some Relief Society sisters recently prayed together as they prepared to visit for the first time a young widow whose husband died suddenly They wanted to know what to do and how to work together to help prepare the home for family and friends who would come at the time of the funeral They needed to know what words of comfort they could speak for the Lord An answer to their prayer came When they arrived at the house each sister moved to complete a task The house was ready so quickly that some sisters regretted not being able to do more Words of comfort were spoken which fit perfectly together They had given the Lord s service as one hearts knit together You have seen evidence as I have that we are moving toward becoming one The miracle of unity is being granted to us as we pray and work for it in the Lord s way Our hearts will be knit together in unity God has promised that blessing to His faithful Saints whatever their differences in background and whatever conflict rages around them He was praying for us as well as His disciples when He asked His Father that we might be one 1The reason that we pray and ask for that blessing is the same reason the Father is granting it We know from experience that joy comes when we are blessed with unity We yearn as spirit children of our Heavenly Father for that joy which we once had with Him in the life before this one His desire is to grant us that sacred wish for unity out of His love for us He cannot grant it to us as individuals The joy of unity He wants so much to give us is not solitary We must seek it and qualify for it with others It is not surprising then that God urges us to gather so that He can bless us He wants us to gather into families He has established classes wards and branches and commanded us to meet together often In those gatherings which God has designed for us lies our great opportunity We can pray and work for the unity that will bring us joy and multiply our power to serve To the Three Nephites the Savior promised joy in unity with Him as their final reward after their faithful service He said Ye shall have fulness of joy and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father yea your joy shall be full even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy and ye shall be even as I am and I am even as the Father and the Father and I are one 2The Lord has given us guides to know what to do to receive the blessing and joy of ever increasing unity The Book of Mormon recounts a time of success It was in the days of Alma at the Waters of Mormon What the people did in those difficult and dangerous circumstances gives us both a guide and encouragement Everything Alma and his people were inspired to do was pointed at helping people choose to have their hearts changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ That is the only way God can grant the blessing of being of one heart In Mosiah we read And they were called the church of God or the church of Christ from that time forward And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets Yea even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord who had redeemed his people And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another but that they should look forward with one eye having one faith and one baptism having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another And thus he commanded them to preach And thus they became the children of God 3That is why Alma commanded the people to teach faith and repentance That is why my children came to expect in every lesson in family night that I would find a way to encourage someone to testify of the Savior and His mission Sometimes the parents did it On our best nights we found a way to encourage the children to do it either by presenting the lesson or answering questions When testimony about the Savior was borne the Holy Ghost verified it On those nights we felt our hearts being knit together In addition to ordinances there are principles we are following as a people which are leading to greater unity One of those principles is revelation Revelation is the only way we can know how to follow the will of the Lord together It requires light from above The Holy Ghost will testify to our hearts and the hearts of those gathered around with us what He would have us do And it is by keeping His commandments that we can have our hearts knit together as one A second principle to guide our progress to become one is to be humble Pride is the great enemy of unity You have seen and felt its terrible effects Just days ago I watched as two people good people began with a mild disagreement It started as a discussion of what was true but became a contest about who was right Voices became gradually louder Faces became a little more flushed Instead of talking about the issue people began talking about themselves giving evidence why their view given their great ability and background was more likely to be right You would have felt alarm as I did We have seen the life destroying effects of such tragic conflict You and I know people who left the fellowship of the Saints over injured pride Happily I am seeing more and more skillful peacemakers who calm troubled waters before harm is done You could be one of those peacemakers whether you are in the conflict or an observer One way I have seen it done is to search for anything on which we agree To be that peacemaker you need to have the simple faith that as children of God with all our differences it is likely that in a strong position we take there will be elements of truth The great peacemaker the restorer of unity is the one who finds a way to help people see the truth they share That truth they share is always greater and more important to them than their differences You can help yourself and others to see that common ground if you ask for help from God and then act He will answer your prayer to help restore peace as He has mine That same principle applies as we build unity with people who are from vastly different backgrounds The children of God have more in common than they have differences And even the differences can be seen as an opportunity God will help us see a difference in someone else not as a source of irritation but as a contribution The Lord can help you see and value what another person brings which you lack More than once the Lord has helped me see His kindness in giving me association with someone whose difference from me was just the help I needed That has been the Lord s way of adding something I lacked to serve Him better That leads to another principle of unity It is to speak well of each other Think of the last time you were asked what you thought about how someone else was doing in your family or in the Church It happened to me more than once in the past week Now there are times we must judge others Sometimes we are required to pronounce such judgments But more often we can make a choice For instance suppose someone asks you what you think of the new bishop As we get better and better at forging unity we will think of a scripture when we hear that question And now my brethren seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge which light is the light of Christ see that ye do not judge wrongfully for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged 4Realizing that you see others in an imperfect light will make you likely to be a little more generous in what you say In addition to that scripture you might remember your mother saying mine did If you can t say anything good about a person don t say anything at all That will help you look for what is best in the bishop s performance and character The Savior as your loving judge will surely do that as He judges your performance and mine The scripture and what you heard from your mother may well lead you to describe what is best in the bishop s performance and his good intent I can promise you a feeling of peace and joy when you speak generously of others in the Light of Christ You will feel for instance unity with that bishop and with the person who asked your opinion not because the bishop is perfect or because the person asking you shares your generous evaluation It will be because the Lord will let you feel His appreciation for choosing to step away from the possibility of sowing seeds of disunity We must follow that same principle as the Lord gathers more and more people who are not like us What will become more obvious to us is that the Atonement brings the same changes in all of us We become disciples who are meek loving easy to be entreated and at the same time fearless and faithful in all things We still live in different countries but we come into the Church through a process that changes us We become by the gifts of the Spirit what the Apostle Paul saw For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God 5With the unity I see increasing the Lord will be able to perform what the world will think as miraculous The Saints can accomplish any purpose of the Lord when fully united in righteousness Presidents of countries governors and leaders of worldwide charitable organizations have praised us in my hearing with words like these Your church was the first on the ground to help when disaster came Hundreds of your people arrived who brought everything with them which the survivors needed They even brought their own tents and supplies They were tireless and cheerful They seemed to know where to go and when Then there has come a line usually something like this Your church knows how to organize to get things done I thank them without saying that the miracle lies not in organization alone but in the people s hearts The Saints came in the name of the Lord to give the succor He would give They came listening to the direction of the Lord s chosen leaders Because their hearts were knit they were magnified in their power I bear you my solemn witness that the unity we now experience will increase God the Father lives He hears and answers our prayers in love The Savior Jesus Christ resurrected and glorious lives and reaches out to us in mercy This is His true Church President Monson is the living prophet of God If we are united in sustaining him with all our hearts with willing obedience to do what God would have us do we will move together in power to go wherever God would have us go and to become what He wants us to be I leave you my blessing that you will enjoy unity in your homes and in the Church And I leave you the Lord s promise that you will have the righteous desire of your heart for that joy in unity In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brethren tonight I wish to encourage priesthood holders who at times feel overwhelmed with their responsibilities That is a challenge I have spoken of before I return to it because it returns so often in the lives of those I love and serve Most of you have discovered that your priesthood duties will stretch you to the point that you wonder if you can stretch that far It may have happened when you were asked to speak in a stake conference before hundreds of people For the recent convert it may have been being asked to pray in public or teach a class for the first time For some it may have been trying to learn a language in a missionary training center If that didn t take you to your limit it surely did on the streets of a strange city when your mission president charged you to speak to every person you met to testify of the Savior and of the Restoration of the gospel You may have thought then Once I finish my mission being a faithful priesthood holder will get easier But in a few years you found yourself getting even less sleep at night while trying to support a wife and a new baby being kind and loving scrambling to get some education reaching out to the members of your elders quorum perhaps even helping them to move their furniture and trying to find time to serve your ancestors in the temple You may have kept a smile on your face with the thought When I get a little older being a faithful priesthood holder will not require so much It will get easier Those of you further down the road are smiling because you know something about priesthood service It is this the more faithful service you give the more the Lord asks of you Your smile is a happy one because you know that He increases our power to carry the heavier load The tough part of that reality however is that for Him to give you that increased power you must go in service and faith to your outer limits It is like building muscle strength You must break down your muscles to build them up You push muscles to the point of exhaustion Then they repair themselves and they develop greater strength Increased spiritual strength is a gift from God which He can give when we push in His service to our limits Through the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ our natures can be changed Then our power to carry burdens can be increased more than enough to compensate for the increased service we will be asked to give That helps me understand when I see someone else who makes priesthood service look easy I know that they have either passed hard tests or that the tests lie ahead So rather than envying them I stand ready to help when the going gets harder for them because it surely will That testing of our limits in priesthood service is made necessary by God s plan to qualify His children to live with Him again forever Heavenly Father loves His children He offered us eternal life to live with Him again in families and in glory forever To qualify us to receive that gift He gave us a mortal body the opportunity to be tempted to sin and a way to be cleansed from that sin and to rise in the First Resurrection He gave us His Beloved Son Jehovah as our Savior to make that possible The Savior was born in mortal life was tempted but never sinned and then in Gethsemane and on Golgotha paid the price of our sins so that we could be cleansed The purifying can come only to those who have faith enough in Jesus Christ to repent of sin be cleansed through the ordinance of baptism and make and keep covenants to obey all His commandments And there was to be a fierce enemy of our souls Lucifer who would with his legions relentlessly try to capture every child of God to keep him or her from having the joy of eternal life In His kindness and in great trust Heavenly Father with the Savior allowed a selected few of His sons on earth to hold the priesthood We have the authority and the power to act in God s name to offer the true gospel of Jesus Christ and its ordinances to as many of Heavenly Father s children as we can So you can sense the magnitude of our trust from God And you can sense its supreme importance and the opposition we face It is not surprising that we feel from time to time nearly overwhelmed Your thought that I m not sure I can do this is evidence that you are understanding what it means to hold the priesthood of God The fact is that you can t do it by yourself The responsibility is too difficult and too important for your mortal powers and for mine Recognizing that is at the foundation of great priesthood service When those feelings of inadequacy strike us it is the time to remember the Savior He assures us that we don t do this work alone There are scriptures to put on your mirror and to remember in the moments when you are doubting your capacity For instance President Thomas S Monson remembered the promised words of the Savior as he blessed me six months ago to stand fearlessly in my calling when it seemed hard These words of the Savior which He gave to His tiny band of priesthood holders in this dispensation came to the prophet s mind as he laid his hands on my head And whoso receiveth you there I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 1The promise which President Monson remembered and quoted was fulfilled for me Confidence replaced doubt the Spirit came medical helpers were inspired my life was preserved and I was borne up Because of that blessing by President Monson it will always be easy for me to remember the Savior and trust His promise that He goes before and beside us in His service I know that the promise of angels to bear us up is real You might want to bring to memory the assurance of Elisha to his frightened servant That assurance is ours when we feel close to being overwhelmed in our service Elisha faced real and terrible opposition And when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots And his servant said unto him Alas my master how shall we do And he answered Fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them And Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha 2Like that servant of Elisha there are more with you than those you can see opposed to you Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal eyes The Lord will bear you up and will at times do it by calling others to stand with you That is why we have quorums That is why quorum leaders look at faces and into eyes in quorum meetings That is why the bishop is more than presiding in the priests quorum He is watching the faces of the priests You will have such a bishop or such an elders quorum president or such a mission president And he will come to help you and call others to stand with you It may be to call the right companion to serve with you in your time of need That suggests at least two things One is to recognize and welcome those whom the Lord sends to help us The other is to see in every assignment the opportunity to strengthen another A mission president once told me of a missionary he assigned to more than 12 or 13 companions He said to me Every one of those companions was about to go home early or be sent home But we didn t lose one of them When I mentioned that miraculous fact later to the companion who saved so many at the point of their being overwhelmed I got a response which surprised and taught me It was this I don t think that story is true I never had a companion who was failing I could see that a mission president had been inspired to send the right angel time after time We can expect in our service to have help sent to us at the right time who will see strength in us and lift us up And we can look forward to being the one sent by the Lord to encourage another I can tell you from experience something about how to help if you are the one sent Shortly after I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve I got a phone call from President Faust counselor in the First Presidency He asked me to come to his office I went with some concern as to why he would take the time to visit with me After some pleasantries he looked at me and said Has it happened yet When I looked puzzled he went on to say I ve been watching you in meetings It seems to me that you have been feeling that your calling is beyond you and that you are not qualified I said that doubt had come to me as if I had hit a wall I expected that he was going to reassure me I told him that I appreciated his being aware of my doubts and asked for his help But I was surprised by his kind firm reply He said Don t ask me Go to Him Then he pointed up to heaven Now years later I sit in that same office When I walk into it I look up and remember him and how he taught me by example how to help those who are feeling overwhelmed in the Lord s service Find a way to send them with confidence to Him If they will follow your counsel they will gain the strength they need and to spare Time and again over your life the Lord has been giving you the experiences to build strength courage and determination He knew how much you would need that to serve Him Some of it may have come as it did for me when you stood with other priesthood holders and said aloud the words Therefore O ye that embark in the service of God see that ye serve him with all your heart might mind and strength that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day 3When you committed to that high standard and met it the Lord was building a trust and strength in you that would be there when you needed it whenever you were called to serve a cause higher than self interest I felt it one bright spring day on a lawn I was being commissioned to defend my country We were not then at war but I was heading for an unknown service that I knew would require all I had to offer perhaps my life I raised my right hand with the others to pledge that I would defend my country with true faith and allegiance and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter So help me God 4I have no doubt that the power to keep that promise which I kept had been forged in me from the time I was a deacon In my early years in the priesthood I sat a number of times in what was then called a missionary farewell There are now so many rising to the call to serve that we let them speak only briefly in a sacrament meeting before they go But then an entire meeting was focused on the missionary who was embarking It always included some selected music I can still feel what I felt as a quartet of returned missionaries would sing I ll go where you want me to go dear Lord and the words went on to pledge I ll say what you want me to say and finally I ll be what you want me to be 5My heart was stirred in those days then as it is now with a conviction that the promise was true for me and for us in all our priesthood service We will find joy in going wherever the Lord would have us serve We will be given the revelation to speak His words to invite Heavenly Father s children to become changed by the Atonement and fit to go home and live with Him And I felt then as I do now that our faithful service would allow Him to change our hearts to fit us for His companionship and to serve Him forever I bear you my witness that when we give our all in priesthood service the Lord will give us all the courage we need and the assurance that He goes with us and that angels will bear us up I testify that we are called of God This is His true Church and you hold His everlasting priesthood I am a witness that President Thomas S Monson holds all the keys of the priesthood and exercises them in the world today In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My purpose tonight is to help you grow in your confidence that you can and will rise to the blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood It is the magnitude of the possible consequences of that oath and covenant which may require a regular boost in your confidence The Lord has made those consequences clear Rising to the possibilities of the oath and covenant brings the greatest of all the gifts of God eternal life That is a purpose of the Melchizedek Priesthood Through keeping the covenants as we receive the priesthood and renewing them in the temple ceremonies we are promised by an oath made by our Heavenly Father Elohim that we will gain the fulness of His glory and live as He lives We will have the blessing of being sealed in a family forever with the promise of eternal increase As you would expect failing to claim such a blessing would bring tragic consequences The Lord was clear about that as well These are the words often read to young men by their leaders when they are approaching the time when they may receive the Melchizedek Priesthood You likely will remember your feelings when you first heard them They are the words of the Savior Jesus Christ given to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me saith the Lord For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father s kingdom therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood Therefore all those who receive the priesthood receive this oath and covenant of my Father which he cannot break neither can it be moved But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it and altogether turneth therefrom shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received which I now confirm upon you who are present this day by mine own voice out of the heavens and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning you And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life 1Now if you are like I was when I first heard those words as a young man the challenge of accepting the Melchizedek Priesthood could seem daunting There are at least two reasons why you should be confident rather than discouraged with the penalties that would follow either failing to keep the oath and covenant or deciding not to accept it Whether you accept the oath and covenant and find it too difficult or if you fail to try the penalty is the same There is no question therefore that your best course and mine is to receive the holy priesthood and try with all of our hearts to keep its covenants If we choose not to try we would certainly lose the opportunity for eternal life If we try and with God s help succeed we will gain eternal life There is yet another reason to decide now that you will try with all your heart to qualify for that oath and covenant and have confidence that you will succeed God promises you the help and power which if you exercise faith will give you success Let me describe some of the blessings you will receive as you go forward in faith First the very fact that you have been offered the oath and covenant is evidence that God has chosen you knowing your power and capacity He has known you since you were with Him in the spirit world With His foreknowledge of your strength He has allowed you to find the true Church of Jesus Christ and to be offered the priesthood You can feel confidence because you have evidence of His confidence in you Second as you will try to keep your covenants the Savior has promised His personal help He has said that as you go forward in honoring the priesthood There I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 2You may at times need reassurance as I do that you will have the strength to meet your obligations in this sacred priesthood The Lord foresaw your need for reassurance He said For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken and the magnifying their calling are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies 3I have seen that promise fulfilled in my own life and in the lives of others A friend of mine served as a mission president He told me that at the end of every day while he was serving he could barely make it upstairs to bed at night wondering if he would have the strength to face another day Then in the morning he would find his strength and his courage restored You have seen it in the lives of aged prophets who seemed to be renewed each time they stood to testify of the Lord Jesus Christ and the restored gospel That is a promise for those who go forward in faith in their priesthood service You are also promised that you will be given the power to bear testimony and that in the process you will be cleansed and made fit for the eternal life which you have been promised For I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment that you remain steadfast in your minds in solemnity and the spirit of prayer in bearing testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you Therefore go ye into all the world and unto whatsoever place ye cannot go ye shall send that the testimony may go from you into all the world unto every creature 4And with that promise the Lord has honored you by saying of you Ye are they whom my Father hath given me ye are my friends 5There is another wonderful blessing that will encourage you as you keep your priesthood covenants Priesthood service will prepare you for living in eternal families It will change your feelings about what it means to be a husband or a father or a son or a brother That change in your heart will come as you feel your faith grow and the promise of eternal life through the Melchizedek Priesthood becomes real to you That happened to Parley P Pratt when the Prophet Joseph Smith first taught him the doctrine of eternal families Parley P Pratt wrote It was at this time that I received from him the first idea of eternal family organization and the eternal union of the sexes in those inexpressibly endearing relationships which none but the highly intellectual the refined and pure in heart know how to prize and which are at the very foundation of everything worthy to be called happiness It was from him that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and all eternity and that the refined sympathies and affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the fountain of divine eternal love It was from him that I learned that we might cultivate these affections and grow and increase in the same to all eternity while the result of our endless union would be an offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven or the sands of the sea shore I had loved before but I knew not why But now I loved with a pureness an intensity of elevated exalted feeling I felt that God was my heavenly Father indeed that Jesus was my brother and that the wife of my bosom was an immortal eternal companion a kind ministering angel given to me as a comfort and a crown of glory for ever and ever 6I am a personal witness that priesthood service pursued in faith has such an effect in changing our hearts and our feelings A young man hearing my words today can have confidence that by honoring his priesthood he will be protected against the temptation to sexual sin so prevalent in the world in which we live It will be possible for the Aaronic Priesthood holder hearing me tonight as his faith increases in the sure reward of eternal life through the eternal priesthood that he will have the power to see in the daughters of God their true worth and in the promise of a posterity a reason to be pure and to stay clean In the same way faith in the oath and covenant will lead us to develop the feelings of charity essential to an eternal family One of the promises we make as we accept the priesthood is to care for others I have seen the miracle of that growth in charity in the hearts of priesthood holders So have many of you And so have many outside the Church I was in the office of President Gordon B Hinckley when he was asked to take a phone call He spoke briefly on the phone and then returned to our conversation But he took a moment to explain He said that the call was from the president of the United States who was flying over Utah in Air Force One on his way to Washington The president of the United States had called to thank President Hinckley for what priesthood holders had done in the aftermath of a hurricane The president of the United States had said that it was a miracle that we were able to get so many people so quickly working together so well He praised our people by saying that we knew how to do things Perhaps the president of the United States was impressed with what he thought were our great organizational skills That was part of the miracle But the greater reason for the miracle was that hundreds and perhaps thousands of priesthood holders had such faith in the oath and covenant of the priesthood It was not how they were organized that made the difference faith in the oath and covenant of the priesthood impelled them to go long distances stay long hours and endure hardship as representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ in caring for those in great need They were in that process of giving priesthood service developing the power and the spirit of charity necessary to become great husbands fathers sons and brothers in families here and in families forever Those instances of priesthood service have occurred in our outreach to people as brothers and sisters in God s family across the earth time and time again My prayer is that you will decide tonight and then every day to go forward in faith in keeping your covenants with God and so claim the promise He has made to you with an oath You can do it in simple things When you meet with your quorum you can decide to see them as brothers in the family of God There will be someone in your quorum or priesthood group who is in need He may not show it You may not be able to see it with your eyes But God knows and invites you to be His servant in helping him You can be like the priesthood holder who every time I saw him in our priesthood service together would ask How s Grandma He had never met my mother in law as far as I know But he somehow found out about her illness and her great age I cannot tell you how much it meant to me to see the hand of God reaching out to me and my wife in consolation and comfort through a priesthood holder You can have that same effect every time you gather with priesthood holders if you always think of your covenant to succor and help those whose hands hang down and who carry heavy burdens As you do you will be developing the very qualities which will qualify you to be a member of a family forever There is another thing you can do You can study the word of God not for yourself alone but to be an emissary of the Lord Jesus Christ to all the world When you increase your power to teach the gospel you are qualifying to help Heavenly Father in gathering His children As you do that another blessing will come Should the need ever come in family life in this world or in the world to come to draw back lost sheep you will have received more power than you may now recognize The Lord describes that wonderful blessing in Alma 13 6 And thus being called by this holy calling and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God to teach his commandments unto the children of men that they also might enter into his rest You may have confidence in your service with this promise of success Now they after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost having their garments made white being pure and spotless before God could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence and there were many exceedingly great many who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God And now my brethren I would that ye should humble yourselves before God and bring forth fruit meet for repentance that ye may also enter into that rest 7I testify that God the Father lives You have made covenants with Him He offers you an oath a promise of eternal life which He cannot break I testify to you that the priesthood is the power by which God through His Son Jesus Christ created the worlds I testify that God wants you to succeed and to come home again to live with Him in families forever I testify to you that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ In it are the keys of the priesthood It is that priesthood with which God has honored you I promise you that He knows your capacities and that they are sufficient that you may with full faith have the hope of eternal life for you and for your families forever In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as prophet seer and revelator and President of the Church and D Todd Christofferson as an Apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles we have seen and felt evidence that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is both true and living The Lord spoke to those through whom He restored the Church in the latter days He said of them that they might have power to lay the foundation of this church and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth with which I the Lord am well pleased speaking unto the church collectively and not individually For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance Nevertheless he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven And he that repents not from him shall be taken even the light which he has received for my Spirit shall not always strive with man saith the Lord of Hosts 1This is the true Church the only true Church because in it are the keys of the priesthood Only in this Church has the Lord lodged the power to seal on earth and to seal in heaven as He did in the time of the Apostle Peter Those keys were restored to Joseph Smith who then was authorized to confer them upon the members of the Quorum of the Twelve When the Prophet Joseph was murdered the enemies of the Church thought that the Church would die They thought it was the creation of a mortal man and therefore would perish with him But their hopes were dashed It was the true Church and it also had the power to live on even when those chosen for a time to lead it died We have seen today a demonstration that this is the true and living Church The keys of the priesthood are held by mortals but the way has been prepared by the Lord for the keys to remain functioning on the earth so long as the people exercise faith both that the keys are on the earth and that they have been passed on by the will of God to His chosen servants God s people have not always been worthy of the marvelous experience we have shared today The Apostles after the Ascension of Christ continued to exercise the keys He left with them But because of disobedience and loss of faith by the members the Apostles died without the keys being passed on to successors We call that tragic episode the Apostasy Had the members of the Church in those days had the opportunity and the will to exercise faith as you have today the Lord would not have taken the keys of the priesthood from the earth So this is a day of historical significance and of eternal importance in the history of the world and to the children of our Heavenly Father Now our obligation is to remain worthy of the faith necessary for us to fulfill our promise to sustain those who have been called The Lord was well pleased with the Church at the beginning of the Restoration as He is today But He cautioned the members then as He does now that He cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance For us to sustain those who have been called today we must examine our lives repent as necessary pledge to keep the Lord s commandments and follow His servants The Lord warns us that if we do not do those things the Holy Ghost will be withdrawn we will lose the light which we have received and we will not be able to keep the pledge we have made today to sustain the Lord s servants in His true Church Each of us must make an individual evaluation First we need to measure the depth of our gratitude for membership in the true Church of Jesus Christ Second we need to know by the power of the Holy Ghost in what ways we can do better in keeping the commandments We know from prophecy that not only will the true and living Church not be taken from the earth again but it will become better Our lives will be transformed for the better as we exercise faith unto repentance always remember the Savior and try ever harder to keep His commandments The scriptures contain promises that when the Lord comes again to His Church He will find it spiritually prepared for Him That should make us both determined and optimistic We must do better We can And we will On this day especially it would be wise to determine to sustain with our faith and our prayers all those who serve us in the kingdom I am personally aware of the power of the faith of members of the Church to sustain those who have been called In the last few weeks I have felt in powerful ways the prayers and the faith of people whom I do not know and who know me only as someone called to serve through the keys of the priesthood President Thomas S Monson will be blessed by your sustaining faith His family will likewise have blessings poured out upon them because of your faith and your prayers All those who were sustained by you today will be sustained by God because of their faith and yours Every member will have opportunities to sustain through service given in the name of God The Church is a powerful force for the blessing of its members and all people across the earth For instance the Church has done remarkable humanitarian work across the earth All of that is possible because of the faith of members and of friends that God lives and that the Lord wishes to succor all of those in need whom He can reach through His faithful disciples Additionally it is through the Church and the ordinances which are in it that the blessings of the sealing power reach into the spirit world This is a true and living Church reaching even to those who are no longer living As you have the faith to find the names of your ancestors as you go to the house of the Lord to offer them vicarious ordinances you sustain this great work whose purpose is to offer salvation to all of Heavenly Father s children who come into this world I would like to speak of some of the reasons I see for gratitude for a true and living Church Then I will suggest some ways in which I see the Church being prepared for the Savior s return And finally I will bear my testimony of how I have come to know that this is the true and living Church Most of all I am grateful for my experience of the cleansing power available through the ordinances performed by the power of priesthood I have felt forgiveness and cleansing through baptism by those with authority I have felt the burning in my bosom that is only possible because of words spoken by servants of God Receive the Holy Ghost My sense of gratitude stems also from blessings to my family It is the sealing power and our knowledge of it which changes and transforms our family life here and our expectations for the joy of family life in the world to come The thought and the hope that I can have eternal relationships carries me through the trials of separation and the loneliness which are part of mortal existence The promise to the faithful in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is that we may have associations and an expansion of families in the eternities That assurance changes forever and for the better all of our associations in families For example I am at a stage in my life when because of great distances I cannot come to know well grandchildren and in time great grandchildren There are also people who have never had the opportunity for marriage and parenthood who have the same yearning as I do to somehow be close to family Because of the restoration of the knowledge of eternal families we are more hopeful and more kindly in all our family relations The greatest joys in this life center in families as they will in the worlds to come I am so grateful for the assurance I have that if we are faithful the same sociality which we enjoy here in this life will be forever with us in the world to come in eternal glory 2I can see evidence of the prophesied perfecting of the Church For example as I travel and come to know the members of the Church I see that there is a steady improvement in their lives In their simple faith and obedience the Atonement is changing and edifying the members Frequently I am in meetings with obviously humble people who are allowed to teach lessons and give sermons which have in them power like that given to Lehi and Nephi the sons of Helaman You remember the account And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak and they also had what they should speak given unto them 3I am confident that the repeated wish of President Gordon B Hinckley will be granted He taught that all who come into the Church might be retained in full fellowship if they are nourished by the good word of God I remember him saying that the last words that he might speak at the end of his service would be retention retention retention His words live on in the leadership of President Monson and in all of us as we qualify to have the power of a Lehi and a Nephi to nourish with the good word of God I am confident that you will continue as I will to be amazed by humble Latter day Saints who home teach visit teach and speak to their nonmember friends with ever greater power For years we have remembered the words of President David O McKay Every member a missionary I am confident that the day is coming that through the faith of the members we will see increasing numbers of people invited to hear the word of God who will then come into the true and living Church There is another improvement I am confident will come Families across the Church are searching for ways to strengthen and protect their children against the evils around them In some cases those parents are desperately trying to bring back some in their family who have wandered I am confident that there will be increasingly a reward given by God for their efforts Those who never give up will find that God never gave up and that He will help them Much of that help will come from those called to serve in the Church The spirit of reaching out will increase so that many will be as the young Bishop Thomas Monson was inspired with practical ways to invite and encourage those who may for a time not recognize the blessings God has in store for them President Monson to this day remembers people he labored to rescue when he was their bishop My hope would be that all of us would have the confidence that God will guide us in reaching out and back to those God would have us bring with us as we go home to Him Another improvement I see coming in the kingdom is a desire and a capacity to reach out to the poor and those in need I have seen an amazing increase among the members of the Church in sympathy for victims of natural disasters across the world In obituary notices I see families asking that donations be sent to the Perpetual Education Fund or to the Church s Humanitarian Fund The Prophet Joseph Smith saw that wonderful development He said that as a person becomes truly converted he or she will want to range across the earth caring for Heavenly Father s children 4 That is already beginning to happen among more of the members of the Church What is remarkable to me is that the pattern of giving to those in need extends to those who have less themselves and seems to be unaffected by whether we are in good or difficult economic times That is evidence to me that the Atonement is working ever more effectively among the members My testimony that this is the true and living Church began in my childhood One of my earliest memories is of a conference meeting held not in some place like this but in a rented room of a hotel A man was speaking whom I did not know nor do I know his name today I knew only that he was someone sent to our little district in the mission field by someone who held the priesthood I do not know what he said But I received a powerful certain witness before I was eight even before I was baptized that I was hearing a servant of God in the true Church of Jesus Christ It was not the rental room nor the size of the congregation which was small but it was a witness that I had been blessed at that moment to be in a meeting of the true Church When I moved with my family to the organized stakes of the Church in my teen years for the first time I felt the power of priesthood quorums and of a loving bishop I still remember and can feel the assurances that came when I sat in a priests quorum next to a bishop and knew that he had the keys of a true judge in Israel That same witness came early in my life on two Sundays one in Albuquerque New Mexico and the other in Boston Massachusetts In each case I was present on the day that a stake was organized from a district Seemingly ordinary men whom I knew well were called as stake presidents I raised my hand on those days as you did today and had a witness come to me that God had called His servants and that I would be blessed by their service and for sustaining them I have now felt that same miracle countless times across the Church I saw in the days and months that followed their being sustained that those stake presidents were lifted up to their callings I have seen the same miracle in the service of President Monson as he received the call to preside as the prophet and President of the Church and to exercise all the keys of the priesthood in the earth Revelation and inspiration have come to him in my presence which confirms to me that God is honoring those keys I am an eyewitness They are keys of a priesthood which is in the Lord s words without beginning or end 5I bear you my solemn witness that this is the true and living Church of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father will answer your fervent prayers to know that for yourself You can have a witness that the calls which you sustained today were from God Even more you can know that within this Church ordinances are performed which can cleanse souls and bind on earth and in heaven as they were in the days of Peter James and John Those keys and ordinances are now restored in their fulness through the Prophet Joseph Smith and have been passed on through his successors Jesus is the Christ He lives I know that I testify that Thomas S Monson is His living prophet The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is true and it lives on I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
For each of us life is a journey Heavenly Father designed it for us out of love Each of us has unique experiences and characteristics but our journey began in the same place before we were born into this world We all were taught by Elohim the Father of our spirits We loved Him and wanted to be like Him and to be with Him forever He told us plainly what it would require for us to have that joy We would have to receive a physical body with all of the trials that would bring We would be subject to illness and have within our bodies the processes which would finally lead to death And our bodies would have in them powerful cravings for physical satisfaction Heavenly Father explained to us what it would take to make the journey from where we were then to be with Him forever and live the life that He lives We would make the journey through life without a memory of our time with Him in the spirit world And the only way back to Him would be for us to overcome physical death and the effects of sin which would come from our breaking commandments He told us that we could not overcome the effects of either death or sin by ourselves without our having a Savior who would break the bands of death and provide a way for us to be washed clean from the sin which we would surely commit You know from the scriptures revealed by God through prophets that there was a rebellion in the spirit world when the plan for our journey was offered to us Those who rebelled did not want to accept and to depend upon a Savior nor run any risk that they might not return again to Heavenly Father Every one of you was among the brave the faithful and the true in that conflict You accepted the Savior and the plan for this journey to return to the joy of our Heavenly Father s presence You are remarkable even among those who chose right in the contest in the spirit world You qualified to come into mortality and to make this journey at a time when the gospel of Jesus Christ was on the earth And among the billions of Heavenly Father s children now living you were privileged to find the gospel of Jesus Christ and His true Church Even more than that the fact that you are listening tonight means that you have chosen to make the journey of life walking in the light Every child of Heavenly Father born in the world is given at birth as a free gift the Light of Christ You have felt that It is the sense of what is right and what is wrong and what is true and what is false That has been with you since your journey in life began The fact that you were baptized and received the Holy Ghost is evidence that you chose to walk in the Light of Christ When you were confirmed a member of the Church you were given the right to have the Holy Ghost as your companion The Holy Ghost is a powerful source of light to recognize truth to follow and love the Lord Jesus Christ and to find your way back to God after this life But the spirit who led the rebellion in the world before still opposes the plan and wants you to be miserable He wants you never to find your way home again That enemy of your soul knows you and your goodness He knows that if he can turn you away from walking in the light he can both capture you and stop you from helping others along the journey He knows how good you are and your power to teach and influence hundreds of Heavenly Father s children in this life and thousands over the generations that will follow your path If he can get you to wander away from the light on your journey he can do harm and bring misery to many The fact that you are listening now is evidence that God recognizes your great importance and that you have chosen to walk in the light He offers you Such choices are not always easy to see clearly You make choices every day and almost every hour that keep you walking in the light or moving away toward darkness Some of the most important choices are about what you set your heart upon There are so many things you may consider desirable For instance all of us want to some degree the approval of other people All of us feel a need for friends All of us are searching for some evidence that we are persons of worth We make choices based on those desires Some might lead us away from the light God offers us as a guide Some may brighten that light by which we can find our way As I look back I realize that I was unaware of the importance of some of those desires and choices I wanted to be selected for athletic teams I wanted to do well in school I wanted to find good and true friends And when I made the choices that came from those desires more than I realized I was either moving away from the light or toward it Some of my achievements and some of my friends were major factors in my sensing light Others more than I knew at the time were edging me away from the light In important and long lasting ways choices I made to satisfy my desires for companionship and a sense of recognition were taking me either toward or away from the light to guide my path Long ago Heavenly Father through His prophets gave us a way to know which choices matter most and why and how to make them The best summary I know is in the words from Moroni as he quotes his father Mormon I only wish I had understood them better when I was your age and I pray that the Lord will carry them into your heart tonight But behold that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually wherefore every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good and to love God and to serve him is inspired of God Wherefore take heed that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God or that which is good and of God to be of the devil For behold my brethren it is given unto you to judge that ye may know good from evil and the way to judge is as plain that ye may know with a perfect knowledge as the daylight is from the dark night 1The scriptures tell us the source and the power of the light For behold the Spirit of Christ is given to every man that he may know good from evil wherefore I show unto you the way to judge for every thing which inviteth to do good and to persuade to believe in Christ is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil and believe not in Christ and deny him and serve not God then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil for after this manner doth the devil work for he persuadeth no man to do good no not one neither do his angels neither do they who subject themselves unto him 2I can see now better than I could as a young man how I might have used that guidance There were sports teams that had players and coaches who influenced me to do good There were some that did not There were friends some of them not members of the Church of Jesus Christ who by their example influenced me to do good and to remember the Savior There were schoolmates and teachers whose approval and friendship I sought who somehow made me want to do good and enhance my feelings for the Savior I was blessed to find my way But I would have done even better had I understood both the importance of my choices and the way to choose Mormon knew that Had I read more carefully his words in the Book of Mormon and others like them I would have been even more blessed and more protected Here are Mormon s words Seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge which light is the light of Christ see that ye do not judge wrongfully for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged Wherefore ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing and condemn it not ye certainly will be a child of Christ And now how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon every good thing 3It is by faith that you can lay hold upon every good thing I pray with all my heart that your faith will be increased that you are a daughter of a loving God I testify to you that you have been one of the valiant ones to reach the point where you now are in this journey of life Just as you are marked as a target by the enemy of righteousness you have been protected and watched over by your Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ They know you They know all of the forces and individuals around you They know what is ahead of you And so They know which of the choices you make which of the desires you decide to satisfy and which of the circumstances around you will make the most difference in keeping you walking in the light I testify that by the Spirit of Christ and by the Holy Ghost you may walk confidently in whatever difficulties will come Because you are so valuable some of your trials may be severe You need never be discouraged or afraid The way through difficulties has always been prepared for you and you will find it if you exercise faith You must have faith to pray You must have faith to ponder the word of God You must have faith to do those things and go to those places which invite the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost I promise you that within the next few days you will feel the illumination of the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost in your everyday life When you walk in the light you will feel at that moment some of the warmth and the happiness that will finally be yours when you are welcomed home again with the hundreds and perhaps thousands of others whom you will bring with you who have walked in the light because you did This is the true Church of Jesus Christ There is a living prophet Thomas S Monson And there are both true servants and angels to help you along the lighted path I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I was grateful for the choir in their broadcast this morning which was about the Savior and grateful to see that the words of one of the songs they sang This Is the Christ were written by President James E Faust As I sat down next to Brother Newell I leaned over to him and asked How are your children He said When President Faust sat in that chair that s what he always asked I m not surprised because President Faust was always a perfect example of a disciple that was described in Music and the Spoken Word today I always felt that when I grew up I wanted to be like President Faust There may still be time When our children were very small I started to write down a few things about what happened every day Let me tell you how that got started I came home late from a Church assignment It was after dark My father in law who lived near us surprised me as I walked toward the front door of my house He was carrying a load of pipes over his shoulder walking very fast and dressed in his work clothes I knew that he had been building a system to pump water from a stream below us up to our property He smiled spoke softly and then rushed past me into the darkness to go on with his work I took a few steps toward the house thinking of what he was doing for us and just as I got to the door I heard in my mind not in my own voice these words I m not giving you these experiences for yourself Write them down I went inside I didn t go to bed Although I was tired I took out some paper and began to write And as I did I understood the message I had heard in my mind I was supposed to record for my children to read someday in the future how I had seen the hand of God blessing our family Grandpa didn t have to do what he was doing for us He could have had someone else do it or not have done it at all But he was serving us his family in the way covenant disciples of Jesus Christ always do I knew that was true And so I wrote it down so that my children could have the memory someday when they would need it I wrote down a few lines every day for years I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day Before I would write I would ponder this question Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today As I kept at it something began to happen As I would cast my mind over the day I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day As that happened and it happened often I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done More than gratitude began to grow in my heart Testimony grew I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened The years have gone by My boys are grown men And now and then one of them will surprise me by saying Dad I was reading in my copy of the journal about when and then he will tell me about how reading of what happened long ago helped him notice something God had done in his day My point is to urge you to find ways to recognize and remember God s kindness It will build our testimonies You may not keep a journal You may not share whatever record you keep with those you love and serve But you and they will be blessed as you remember what the Lord has done You remember that song we sometimes sing Count your many blessings name them one by one And it will surprise you what the Lord has done 2It won t be easy to remember Living as we do with a veil over our eyes we cannot remember what it was like to be with our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ in the premortal world nor can we see with our physical eyes or with reason alone the hand of God in our lives Seeing such things takes the Holy Ghost And it is not easy to be worthy of the Holy Ghost s companionship in a wicked world That is why forgetting God has been such a persistent problem among His children since the world began Think of the times of Moses when God provided manna and in miraculous and visible ways led and protected His children Still the prophet warned the people who had been so blessed as prophets always have warned and always will Take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life 3And the challenge to remember has always been the hardest for those who are blessed abundantly Those who are faithful to God are protected and prospered That comes as the result of serving God and keeping His commandments But with those blessings comes the temptation to forget their source It is easy to begin to feel the blessings were granted not by a loving God on whom we depend but by our own powers The prophets have repeated this lament over and over And thus we can behold how false and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men yea we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him Yea and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people yea in the increase of their fields their flocks and their herds and in gold and in silver and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art sparing their lives and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them yea and in fine doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people yea then is the time that they do harden their hearts and do forget the Lord their God and do trample under their feet the Holy One yea and this because of their ease and their exceedingly great prosperity And the prophet goes on to say Yea how quick to be lifted up in pride yea how quick to boast and do all manner of that which is iniquity and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God and to give ear unto his counsels yea how slow to walk in wisdom s paths 4Sadly prosperity is not the only reason people forget God It can also be hard to remember Him when our lives go badly When we struggle as so many do in grinding poverty or when our enemies prevail against us or when sickness is not healed the enemy of our souls can send his evil message that there is no God or that if He exists He does not care about us Then it can be hard for the Holy Ghost to bring to our remembrance the lifetime of blessings the Lord has given us from our infancy and in the midst of our distress There is a simple cure for the terrible malady of forgetting God His blessings and His messages to us Jesus Christ promised it to His disciples when He was about to be crucified resurrected and then taken away from them to ascend in glory to His Father They were concerned to know how they would be able to endure when He was no longer with them Here is the promise It was fulfilled for them then It can be fulfilled for all of us now These things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you 5The key to the remembering that brings and maintains testimony is receiving the Holy Ghost as a companion It is the Holy Ghost who helps us see what God has done for us It is the Holy Ghost who can help those we serve to see what God has done for them Heavenly Father has given a simple pattern for us to receive the Holy Ghost not once but continually in the tumult of our daily lives The pattern is repeated in the sacramental prayer We promise that we will always remember the Savior We promise to take His name upon us We promise to keep His commandments And we are promised that if we do that we will have His Spirit to be with us 6 Those promises work together in a wonderful way to strengthen our testimonies and in time through the Atonement to change our natures as we keep our part of the promise It is the Holy Ghost who testifies that Jesus Christ is the Beloved Son of a Heavenly Father who loves us and wants us to have eternal life with Him in families With even the beginning of that testimony we feel a desire to serve Him and to keep His commandments When we persist in doing that we receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost to give us power in our service We come to see the hand of God more clearly so clearly that in time we not only remember Him but we come to love Him and through the power of the Atonement become more like Him You might ask But how does this process get started in someone who knows nothing about God and claims no memory of spiritual experiences at all Everyone has had spiritual experiences that they may not have recognized Every person upon entering the world is given the Spirit of Christ How that spirit works is described in the book of Moroni For behold the Spirit of Christ is given to every man that he may know good from evil wherefore I show unto you the way to judge for every thing which inviteth to do good and to persuade to believe in Christ is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil and believe not in Christ and deny him and serve not God then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil for after this manner doth the devil work for he persuadeth no man to do good no not one neither do his angels neither do they who subject themselves unto him Wherefore I beseech of you brethren that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing and condemn it not ye certainly will be a child of Christ 7So even before people receive the right to the gifts of the Holy Ghost when they are confirmed as members of the Church and even before the Holy Ghost confirms truth to them before baptism they have spiritual experiences The Spirit of Christ has already from their childhood invited them to do good and warned them against evil They have memories of those experiences even if they have not recognized their source That memory will come back to them as missionaries or we teach them the word of God and they hear it They will remember the feeling of joy or sorrow when they are taught the truths of the gospel And that memory of the Spirit of Christ will soften their hearts to allow the Holy Ghost to testify to them That will lead them to keep commandments and want to take the name of the Savior upon them And when they do in the waters of baptism and as they hear the words in confirmation Receive the Holy Ghost spoken by an authorized servant of God the power to always remember God will be increased I testify to you that the warm feelings you have had as you have listened to truth being spoken in this conference are from the Holy Ghost The Savior who promised that the Holy Ghost would come is the beloved glorified Son of our Heavenly Father Tonight and tomorrow night you might pray and ponder asking the questions Did God send a message that was just for me Did I see His hand in my life or the lives of my children I will do that And then I will find a way to preserve that memory for the day that I and those that I love will need to remember how much God loves us and how much we need Him I testify that He loves us and blesses us more than most of us have yet recognized I know that is true and it brings me joy to remember Him In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Tonight my thoughts are about a boy somewhere in the world He is wondering if he can do what being a priesthood holder will require of him I had that worry when I was about 13 or 14 I had grown up in the mission field where there was only a tiny branch which met in my home Then my family moved to where there were stakes and large wards and chapels and quorums of boys who all seemed to know so much more than I did about what priesthood holders do They had in that ward a complicated pattern for passing the sacrament I felt almost certain that I would make a mistake when my turn to pass or prepare the sacrament came In my fear and desperation I remember going outside the chapel to be alone I was worried I prayed for help and for some assurance that I would not fail in serving God in His priesthood It is now many years later I have held the Melchizedek Priesthood for more than 50 years But in the last few days I have prayed with that same pleading for help and assurance that I will not fail in the call which has come to me to serve in the First Presidency Others seem so much more able to serve and so much better prepared But as I prayed this time I think I could feel an answer that was probably sent to me outside the Yalecrest Ward chapel long ago It is the same answer you can expect to get when you face a call to serve in the priesthood which seems beyond you The message may come in words to your mind or in a feeling or both But it will include at least three things to give you assurance and guidance in what you must do in this seemingly overwhelming calling First the assurance will come from a memory of times Heavenly Father has helped you through dangers and difficulties That s happened to me in the last few days When I was young and still living in New Jersey a large crowd of angry people gathered in front of our house My mother went out to meet them standing alone in this crowd of people who looked very dangerous to me I couldn t hear what she said but after a few minutes they went away peacefully I still remember that I had seen a miracle From when I was older I have a more recent memory of a crowd of angry people I was called by the First Presidency to face who suddenly and inexplicably were touched by a spirit of calm and reconciliation Another time I was sent to speak to leaders of churches in the United States and ministers of those churches who had met in Minneapolis to deal with the problem of competition among churches When I arrived I found that I was assigned to be a speaker My subject was to be Why there was a need for a restoration of the true Church through Joseph Smith I was a last minute substitute for Elder Neal A Maxwell When I arrived in the city the night before the meetings and looked at the program I called President Hinckley I told him that the meetings were to last three days that many talks were to be given at the same time that the crowd could choose which one to attend I told him that I thought if I told the truth I feared that no one would come to my second session and that I might be coming home very quickly I asked him what he thought I should do He said Use your best judgment I prayed through the night Somewhere near dawn I was sure I was to say about the Restoration not This is what we believe happened to Joseph Smith and why we believe it happened but This is what happened to Joseph Smith and this is why the Lord did it In the nighttime I was given no assurance of the outcome just a clear direction go forward To my amazement after my talk the ministers lined up to speak to me Every one of them one after another coming to me told essentially the same story Each of them had met a member of the Church somewhere in their lives that they admired Many of them said that they lived in a community where the stake president had come to the aid of not just his members but of the community in a disaster They asked if I could take back their greeting and their thanks to people I not only didn t know but had no hope of ever meeting By the end of the three days of meetings larger and larger crowds were coming to hear the message of the Restoration of the gospel and the true Church of Jesus Christ not because they believed the message but because they had seen goodness in people s lives the fruits of that restoration As I prayed in these last few nights those and other memories flooded back with an assurance something like this Haven t I always looked after you Think of the times I have led you beside the still waters Remember the times I have set a table before you in the presence of your enemies Remember and fear no evil See Psalm 23 So to the new deacons remember He has always taken care of you from your childhood To the new quorum presidents remember To you fathers with children who are a challenge to you remember and have no fear What is impossible for you is possible with God s help in His service And even when you were very small and in the years since He has with His power and His Spirit gone before your face and been on your left hand and on your right hand when you went in His service see D C 84 88 You can receive assurance that God will watch over you if you pray for it in faith I know that The second part of the message you will receive as you pray for help in facing a hard assignment came to me very early Friday morning I had prayed as you will about overwhelming inadequacies The answer was very clear and very direct and really a rebuke as I prayed Forget yourself start praying about the people you are to serve That does wonders I can testify to bring the Holy Ghost But be prepared to lose track of time as you pray You will feel love for the people you are to serve You will feel their needs their hopes their hurts and those of their families And as you pray the circle will grow wider than you would imagine to perhaps people not in your quorum or your family but to those they love across the world When you forget yourself to pray for the circle of others your service will be extended in your heart It will change not only your service but your heart That is because the Father and His Beloved Son whom you are called to serve know and love so many people your service will touch however limited to a few it may seem to be to you The third and final message you can watch for when you pray for help in a hard priesthood assignment is this one I got this one as well go to work Priesthood power is given you to bless others And that always takes moving out and doing something usually something hard to do So you can expect in addition to assurance of God s help and the command to forget yourself the clear prompting by the Holy Ghost to go and do something which will bless someone s life That may be as obvious as going prayerfully to visit a person or a family or a quorum member to whom you are assigned to serve For a father it may be to correct one of his children Whether what you do is to correct or to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ you will do it better if you remember what success will be You are to help Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ make eternal life possible for those you serve To do that the Spirit must take a testimony down into their hearts And that testimony has to lead them to choose to keep the commandments of God whatever storms and temptations may come With that in mind the Spirit will guide you in teaching and correcting with priesthood power You will keep yourself clean so that you will teach with the Spirit You will pray for the Spirit to tell you when to correct and how to correct and how to show an increase of love see D C 121 43 44 Whatever you do in your priesthood service can be guided and measured by how well it could or did help the person take a testimony of the truth down into his or her life and heart enough for the Atonement to work and keep working You can get assurance in your service You can forget yourself and begin to pray for and love those you are to serve And you can choose what to do and measure success by the degree to which it changes the hearts of the people you serve But it is never going to be easy for you or for those you serve There will always be pain in service and in the repentance necessary to bring the power of the Atonement to change hearts That is in the nature of what you are called to do Think of the Savior whose service you are in At what point in His mortal life can you see an instance when it was easy for Him Did He ask easy things of His disciples then Then why should it ever be easy in His service or for His disciples The reason for that is suggested by the phrase a broken heart about which you have been taught so well today The scriptures sometimes speak of people s hearts being softened but more often the words describing the state we seek for ourselves and for those we serve are a broken heart This may help us accept that our call to serve and the need for the repentance we need and seek will not be easy And it helps us understand better why testimony needs to go down into the hearts of our people Faith that Jesus Christ atoned for their sins has to go down into the heart a broken heart Now tonight let us decide together what we are going to do All of us whatever our callings may be face tasks that are beyond our own powers I do and you do That s true from the simple fact that success is to get testimony down into the hearts of people We can t make that happen Even God won t force that on anyone So success requires people we serve to choose to accept the testimony of the Spirit into their hearts The Spirit is ready But many people aren t ready to invite the Spirit Our task which is in our power is to invite the Spirit into our lives so that people we serve will want to have the fruits of the Spirit in their lives the fruits that they can see in ours This leads me to some suggestions of what we can choose to do or not to do Some things we can do invite the Spirit Some force the Spirit to withdraw You know that from your own experience No priesthood holder who wants to succeed will be careless about where his eyes may go Choosing to look at images which incite lust will cause the Spirit to withdraw You have been warned by Elder Clayton as well as you may ever be warned about the dangers of the Internet and the media in putting pornographic images before us But immodesty is now so common that everyday life requires discipline a conscious choice not to linger watching whatever might create in us feelings which would repel the Spirit The same care is required in what we say We cannot hope to speak for the Lord unless we are careful with our speech Vulgarity and profanity offend the Spirit Just as immodesty seems to be more common so does vulgar and profane language It used to be that only in certain places and with certain groups would we hear the name of the Lord taken in vain or hear vulgar words and crude humor Now it seems to be everywhere and for many socially acceptable where once it was not You can decide and you must to change what you say even when you can t control what others say But I know from my own experience that even in such a terrible situation you can count on God s help Years ago I was an air force officer serving for two years in an office with a marine colonel an army colonel and a grizzled navy commander They had learned to speak in war and in peace in a way which offended me and I know it repelled the Holy Ghost I was at the time serving as a district missionary trying in the evenings to go out to find people and teach them under the influence of the Holy Ghost It was very hard I was only a lieutenant They were very senior to me I had no way of changing their language But I prayed for help I don t know how God did it but in time their language changed Slowly the profanity disappeared and then the vulgarity Only when they drank liquor did it come back but that was in the evenings so I could excuse myself for missionary work You can have memories like that to sustain your faith when life puts you in difficult places God helps the faithful priesthood holder who decides to see and say no evil even in a wicked world It will not be easy It never is But you can have the promise fulfilled for you as I know that it can be for me Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven D C 121 45 I testify that I know that you and I hold the priesthood of God and that He will answer our prayers with sweet assurance and with the help to serve Him better I so promise you and testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
There is a danger in the word someday when what it means is not this day Someday I will repent Someday I will forgive him Someday I will speak to my friend about the Church Someday I will start to pay tithing Someday I will return to the temple Someday The scriptures make the danger of delay clear It is that we may discover that we have run out of time The God who gives us each day as a treasure will require an accounting We will weep and He will weep if we have intended to repent and to serve Him in tomorrows which never came or have dreamt of yesterdays where the opportunity to act was past This day is a precious gift of God The thought Someday I will can be a thief of the opportunities of time and the blessings of eternity There is solemn warning and counsel in the words recorded in the Book of Mormon And now as I said unto you before as ye have had so many witnesses therefore I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end for after this day of life which is given us to prepare for eternity behold if we do not improve our time while in this life then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed Ye cannot say when ye are brought to that awful crisis that I will repent that I will return to my God Nay ye cannot say this for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world 1Then Amulek warns that procrastinating your repentance and service can cause the Spirit of the Lord to withdraw from you But with the warning he gives this hope And this I know because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell yea and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom to go no more out but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb 2The scriptures are filled with examples of wise servants of God who treasured the day they were in and chose to do what they could to bring cleansing Joshua was one Choose you this day whom ye will serve he said but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord 3Serving Him invites the Holy Ghost to be with us And the Holy Ghost is a cleanser of sin Even the Savior who was without sin set an example of the need not to procrastinate He said I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world 4As the risen Savior He is this day and forever the Light of the World It is He who invites us to come unto Him and serve Him without delay His encouragement to you and to me is this I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me 5That is as true of a day as it is of a life A morning prayer and an early search in the scriptures to know what we should do for the Lord can set the course of a day We can know which task of all those we might choose matters most to God and therefore to us I have learned such a prayer is always answered if we ask and ponder with childlike submission ready to act without delay to perform even the most humble service On many days doing what matters most will not be easy It is not supposed to be God s purpose in creation was to let us prove ourselves The plan was explained to us in the spirit world before we were born We were valiant enough there to qualify for the opportunity to choose against temptation here to prepare for eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God We rejoiced to know the test would be one of faithful obedience even when it would not be easy And we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them 6Hard as we knew the test would be we felt joy because we had confidence that we could pass it Our confidence came from knowing that Jesus Christ would come into the world as our Savior He would overcome death He would make it possible for us to be cleansed of our sins by qualifying for the effects of His Atonement We also knew some reassuring facts about what it would take to receive the purifying which we would need Everything that cleansing would require baptism by authority receiving the Holy Ghost under the hands of authorized priesthood bearers remembering Him and therefore having His Spirit to be with us and then keeping His commandments all would be possible for the humblest of us It would not take superior intellect nor would it take wealth nor long life And we knew that the Savior would draw us to Him and would have the power to help us when the test would be hard and the temptation to procrastinate great Alma the great prophet described how Christ gained that ability And he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities 7All of us will need His help to avoid the tragedy of procrastinating what we must do here and now to have eternal life For most of us the temptation to delay will come from one or both of two feelings They are polar opposites one is to be complacent about what we have already done and the other is to feel overwhelmed by the need to do more Complacency is a danger for us all It can come to naive youth who feel that there will be plenty of time in the future for spiritual things They might think that they have already done enough considering the brief time they have lived I know from experience how the Lord can help such a youth to see that he or she is in the midst of spiritual things now He can help you see that classmates are watching you He can help you see that their eternal future is shaped by what they observe you do or not do Your simple thanks for their influence for good on you can lift them more than you imagine When you ask God He can and will reveal to you the opportunities to lift others for Him which He has placed around you from your infancy Complacency can affect even the seasoned adult The better and the longer you serve the more likely that the tempter can place this lie in your mind You have earned a rest You may have been the Primary president in your little branch twice Or you may have worked long and hard on your mission and sacrificed so much to serve Or perhaps you were the pioneer in the Church where you live The thought may come Why not leave the service to the new people I have done my part The temptation will be to believe that you will return to serve again someday The Lord can help you see the danger in taking a rest because you feel you have done enough He helped me by letting me have a conversation with one of His aged servants He was feeble his body weakened by decades of faithful labor and by illness His doctors no longer allowed him to leave his home At his request I reported a trip I had taken in the Lord s service across several nations in dozens of meetings and in many private interviews helping individuals and families I told him of the gratitude people expressed to me for him and his many years of service He asked me if I had another assignment soon I told him about another long trip soon to come He surprised me and he gave me an inoculation against complacency which I hope will last forever when he grabbed my arm and said Oh please take me with you It is hard to know when we have done enough for the Atonement to change our natures and so qualify us for eternal life And we don t know how many days we will have to give the service necessary for that mighty change to come But we know that we will have days enough if only we don t waste them Here is the good news And the days of the children of men were prolonged according to the will of God that they might repent while in the flesh wherefore their state became a state of probation and their time was lengthened according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men 8That assurance from the Master can help those of us feeling overwhelmed by our circumstances In the hardest trials as long as you have the power to pray you can ask a loving God Please let me serve this day It doesn t matter to me how few things I may be able to do Just let me know what I can do I will obey this day I know that I can with Thy help The quiet invitation to you may be to do so simple a thing as to forgive someone who has offended you You can do that from a hospital bed It may be to go to help someone who is hungry You may feel overwhelmed by your own poverty and the labors of the day But if you decide not to wait until you have more strength and more money and if you pray for the Holy Spirit as you go you will when you arrive know what to do and how to help someone even poorer than you are You may find when you get there that they were praying and expecting that someone like you would come in the name of the Lord For those who are discouraged by their circumstances and are therefore tempted to feel they cannot serve the Lord this day I make you two promises Hard as things seem today they will be better in the next day if you choose to serve the Lord this day with your whole heart Your circumstances may not be improved in all the ways which you desire But you will have been given new strength to carry your burdens and new confidence that when your burdens become too heavy the Lord whom you have served will carry what you cannot He knows how He prepared long ago He suffered your infirmities and your sorrows when He was in the flesh so that He would know how to succor you The other promise I make to you is that by choosing to serve Him this day you will feel His love and grow to love Him more You may remember the scripture I say unto you I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called and also the name by which he shall call you For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart 9By serving Him this day you will come to know Him better You will feel His love and appreciation You would not want to delay receiving that blessing And feeling His love will draw you back to His service wiping away both complacency and discouragement As you serve Him you will come to know better the voice by which you shall be called When you go to sleep at the end of a day the words may come back in memory Well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things 10 I pray for that benediction on this day on every day and on our lives I know that Heavenly Father lives and answers our prayers I know that Jesus is the living Christ the Savior of the world and that we can choose to feel joy and peace in His service this day In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful to be with you in this great priesthood meeting All of us are members of a quorum in the priesthood That may not seem remarkable to you but it does to me I was ordained a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood in a tiny branch of the Church There was only one family in the branch We had no chapel We met in our house I was the only deacon and my brother the only teacher So I know what it is like to exercise the priesthood alone without serving with others in a quorum I was content in that small branch without a quorum I had no way to know what I was missing And then my family moved across a continent to where there were many priesthood holders and strong quorums I have learned over the years that the strength in a quorum doesn t come from the number of priesthood holders in it Nor does it come automatically from the age and maturity of the members Rather the strength of a quorum comes in large measure from how completely its members are united in righteousness That unity in a strong quorum of the priesthood is not like anything I have experienced in an athletic team or club or any other organization in the world The words of Alma recorded in the book of Mosiah come closest to describing the unity I have felt in the strongest priesthood quorums And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another but that they should look forward with one eye having one faith and one baptism having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another 1Alma even told his people how to qualify for that unity He told them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord who had redeemed his people 2What Alma was teaching and what is true in any unified priesthood quorum I have seen is that the members hearts are being changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ That is how their hearts become knit together You can see then why the Lord charges the presidents of quorums to lead in the way that He does In the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants He uses almost the same words describing the duties of the president in each quorum The deacons quorum president is to teach the quorum members their duty as it is given according to the covenants 3 The president of the teachers quorum is to teach its members their duties as given in the covenants 4 The president of the priests quorum who is the bishop is commanded to preside over forty eight priests and sit in council with them to teach them the duties of their office as is given in the covenants 5The elders quorum president is charged this way Again the duty of the president over the office of elders is to preside over ninety six elders and to sit in council with them and to teach them according to the covenants 6It is easy to understand why God wants His quorums taught according to the covenants Covenants are solemn promises Heavenly Father has promised us all eternal life if we will make and keep covenants For instance we receive the priesthood with a covenant to be faithful in helping Him in His work The people we baptize into His Church promise to have faith in Jesus Christ and to repent and to keep His commandments Every covenant requires faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments to qualify for the forgiveness and purified hearts necessary to inherit eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God You might ask Does that mean that every lesson in the quorum must only be about faith and repentance Of course not But it does mean that the teacher and those who participate must always desire to bring the Spirit of the Lord into the hearts of the members in the room to produce faith and a determination to repent and to be clean And that desire goes beyond the walls of the room where the quorum meets In a truly united quorum that desire extends to the members wherever they are I saw that a few years ago in a deacons quorum where I had been called to teach the lessons A few of the deacons failed to come to the quorum meetings from time to time I knew that the teaching in that quorum and in every quorum was the charge of the president who had keys He was to sit in council with all of them And so I have made a habit of seeking the counsel of the one with the charge from God by asking him What do you think I should teach What should I try to accomplish I learned to follow his counsel because I knew God had given him responsibility for the teaching of his quorum members I knew one Sunday that God had honored the charge to a young quorum president I was teaching the deacons I noticed an empty chair There was a recording device sitting on the chair and I could see that it was running After the class a boy sitting next to the empty chair picked up the recorder As he started to leave the room I asked him why he had recorded our discussion He smiled and said that another deacon had told him that he wouldn t be in the quorum that day He was taking the recorder to his friend at home so that he could listen to our lesson I had trusted in the responsibility given to a young quorum president so help from heaven came The Spirit came to touch the members in that room and sent one of them to a friend to try to strengthen his faith and lead him to repentance The deacon carrying the recorder had learned according to the covenants and he reached out to help his friend and fellow member in the quorum Priesthood quorum members are taught in more ways than by lessons in a class The quorum is a service unit and the members learn in their service A quorum can give greater service than the members could give alone And that power is multiplied by more than their numbers Every quorum has a leader with authority and responsibility to direct priesthood service I have seen the power that comes when quorums are called to move out to help in times of disaster Time and again I have had people outside the Church express surprise and admiration for the effectiveness of the Church in organizing to give help It seems to them like a miracle In all priesthood service the miracle of power comes because leaders and members honor the authority of those who direct the service in priesthood quorums across the earth Miracles of power can come as quorums reach out to serve others They come as well when the priesthood service is to members within the quorum A deacons quorum president met early one Sunday before the quorum meeting with his counselors and with the quorum secretary After prayerful consideration in council he felt inspired to call a deacon to invite to the next quorum meeting another deacon who had never attended He knew that the deacon who had never attended had a father who was not a member of the Church and that his mother had little interest in the Church The designated deacon accepted the call from his president to contact the boy He went I watched him go He went a little reluctantly as if it might be a hard task The boy he invited to come with him to quorum came only a few times before his family moved away Many years later I was in a stake conference thousands of miles away from where that deacons quorum had met Between conference meetings a man I did not know came up to me and asked if I knew someone He gave me a name It was the boy who was called by his deacons quorum president to go after and care for one lost sheep The man said to me Will you thank him for me I am the grandfather of the boy he invited to a deacons quorum years ago He is grown now But he still talks with me about the deacon who invited him to go with him to church He had tears in his eyes and so did I A young quorum president had been inspired to reach out to a lost member of his quorum He was inspired to send a boy on the errand to serve That president had done what the Master would have done And in the process a young president trained a new priesthood holder in his duty to serve others according to the covenants Hearts were knit which were still connected after more than 20 years and across thousands of miles Quorum unity lasts when it is forged in the Lord s service and in the Lord s way One of the hallmarks of a strong quorum is the feeling of fellowship among its members They care for each other They help each other Quorum presidents can build that fellowship best if they remember the Lord s purpose for unity in the quorum It is of course so that they will help each other But it is more much more It is so that they will lift and encourage each other to serve in righteousness with the Master in His work to offer eternal life to Heavenly Father s children Understanding that will change the way we try to build fellowship in the quorum For instance it might even change the way a teachers quorum plays basketball The members might hope to build fellowship more than just to win a game They could choose to invite a boy who is always left out because he doesn t play very well If he accepts and comes the members of the quorum are likely to pass the ball a little more looking for the open man especially the boy who isn t likely to score Twenty years later they may not remember whether they won that night but they will always remember how they played together and why and whose team it was It was the Lord who said If ye are not one ye are not mine 7Understanding why the Lord wants fellowship can change the way an elders quorum party is planned I ve been to a party where the man who planned it was a convert to the Church Finding the gospel was the sweetest thing that had ever happened to him So neighbors and friends not yet members of the Church were invited to the party I still remember the feeling of fellowship as we visited with them about what the Church meant to us I felt in that party more than fellowship with brothers in the priesthood The Master invited His disciples to His first Quorum of the Twelve in His mortal ministry this way Follow me and I will make you fishers of men 8 And so that night at a party I felt that I was in the fellowship of the Master and His disciples becoming what He wants us to be I was blessed with that same feeling of fellowship by a priesthood leader when I was in the Aaronic Priesthood He understood how to build priesthood fellowship that can last He arranged with the owner of a woodlot for us to spend an afternoon chopping wood and putting it in bundles The bundles were for widows so that they could have a fire in the cold of winter I still remember the warmth of fellowship I felt with my priesthood brethren But even more I remember feeling that I was doing what the Savior would do And so I felt fellowship with Him We can build that precious fellowship in our quorums in this life and then we can have it forever in glory and in families if we live according to the covenants My prayer is that you will accept the Lord s invitation to become united as one in our quorums of the priesthood He has marked the way And He has promised us that with His help good quorums can become great quorums He wants that for us And I know that He needs stronger quorums to bless the children of our Heavenly Father according to the covenants I have faith that He will I know that our Heavenly Father lives I know that His Son Jesus Christ atoned for our sins and those of everyone we will ever meet He was resurrected He lives He leads His Church He holds the keys of the priesthood Through inspiration to those who hold keys in the Church He calls every president of every priesthood quorum I testify that the priesthood was restored with all its keys to Joseph Smith And I bear solemn witness that those keys have been passed to the present day to the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints who is the president of the priesthood in all the earth I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
The prophets of God have foreseen the times in which we live The Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy This know also that in the last days perilous times shall come 1 Anyone with eyes to see the signs of the times and ears to hear the words of prophets knows that the peril is great The peril comes from the forces of wickedness Those forces are increasing And so it will become harder not easier to keep the covenants we must make to live the gospel of Jesus Christ For those of us who are concerned about such a future for ourselves and for those we love in our families in our quorums and in our classes there is hope in the promise the Lord has given us of a place of safety in the storms ahead Here is a word picture of that place You have read about it in scripture It has been repeatedly described by living prophets A loving father told his sons of it this way as he tried to strengthen them against the storms of temptation And now my sons remember remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer who is Christ the Son of God that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds yea his shafts in the whirlwind yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo because of the rock upon which ye are built which is a sure foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall 2It has never been more important than it is now to understand how to build on that sure foundation For me there is no better place to look than in the last sermon of King Benjamin recorded in the Book of Mormon Most of us have read it again recently and have pondered it more than once King Benjamin could see us and our descendants He knew by prophetic power what we face He knew from his own experience the terrors of war He had defended his people in combat relying on the power of God He saw clearly the terrible powers of Lucifer to tempt and to overcome us He was a great and a holy man And he knew how to invite people to build on that rock of safety as well as any of the Lord s prophets He started in his discourse where we must all begin to help people escape spiritual disaster People have to believe that the danger is real to want to find safety They have to fear the consequence of ignoring the peril He made clear the hazards we face because we are free to choose between right and wrong and because we cannot avoid the consequence of those choices He spoke directly and sharply because he knew what sorrow would come to those who might not hear and heed his warnings Here is how he described the consequences which follow our choice either to follow the prompting of the Spirit of Christ or to follow the evil messages which come from Satan whose purpose is to tempt us and trap us into sin For behold there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that evil spirit for if he listeth to obey him and remaineth and dieth in his sins the same drinketh damnation to his own soul for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge Therefore if that man repenteth not and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord and doth fill his breast with guilt and pain and anguish which is like an unquenchable fire whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever King Benjamin went on O all ye old men and also ye young men and you little children who can understand my words for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression 3For me the power of that warning is the picture it forms in my mind of that time when we will each stand before the Savior after this life to be judged When King Benjamin speaks to me of shrinking from the presence of the Lord it puts fear into my heart I can see myself standing in that day of judgment before the glorified and resurrected Savior I want with all my heart not to shrink but rather to look up at Him and see Him smile and say Well done thou good and faithful servant Enter in 4King Benjamin makes it clear how we can earn the hope to hear those words if we find the way in this life to have our natures changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ That is the only way we can build on the sure foundation and so stand firm in righteousness during the storms of temptation King Benjamin describes that change with a beautiful comparison used by prophets for millennia and by the Lord Himself It is this that we can and we must become as a child a little child For some that will not be easy to understand or to accept Most of us want to be strong We may well see being like a child as being weak Most parents have wanted their children at times to be less childish Even the Apostle Paul used these words as he was about to urge us to incorporate charity the pure love of Christ into our lives When I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things 5But King Benjamin who understood as well as any mortal what it meant to be a man of strength and courage makes it clear that to be like a child is not to be childish It is to be like the Savior who prayed to His Father for strength to be able to do His will and then did it Our natures must be changed to become as a child to gain the strength we must have to be safe in the times of moral peril Here is King Benjamin s stirring description of what that change to become like a child is and how it comes to us For the natural man is an enemy to God and has been from the fall of Adam and will be forever and ever unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord and becometh as a child submissive meek humble patient full of love willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him even as a child doth submit to his father 6We are safe on the rock which is the Savior when we have yielded in faith in Him have responded to the Holy Spirit s direction to keep the commandments long enough and faithfully enough that the power of the Atonement has changed our hearts When we have by that experience become as a child in our capacity to love and obey we are on the sure foundation From King Benjamin we learn what we can do to take us to that safe place But remember the things we do are the means not the end we seek What we do allows the Atonement of Jesus Christ to change us into what we must be Our faith in Jesus Christ brings us to repentance and to keeping His commandments We obey and we resist temptation by following the promptings of the Holy Ghost In time our natures will change We will become as a little child obedient to God and more loving That change if we do all we must to keep it will qualify us to enjoy the gifts which come through the Holy Ghost Then we will be safe on the only sure rock Like you I have felt what King Benjamin meant when he said that we could become like a little child before God I have prayed as you have to know what to do when choices that I faced would have eternal consequences Over many years I have seen a recurring pattern in the times when the answers to such a prayer have come most clearly Once for instance I prayed through the night to know what I was to choose to do in the morning I knew that no other choice could have had a greater effect on the lives of others and on my own I knew what choice looked most comfortable to me I knew what outcome I wanted But I could not see the future I could not see which choice would lead to which outcome So the risk of being wrong seemed too great to me I prayed but for hours there seemed to be no answer Just before dawn a feeling came over me More than at any time since I had been a child I felt like one My heart and my mind seemed to grow very quiet There was a peace in that inner stillness Somewhat to my surprise I found myself praying Heavenly Father it doesn t matter what I want I don t care anymore what I want I only want that Thy will be done That is all that I want Please tell me what to do In that moment I felt as quiet inside as I had ever felt And the message came and I was sure who it was from It was clear what I was to do I received no promise of the outcome There was only the assurance that I was a child who had been told what path led to whatever He wanted for me I learned from that experience and countless repetitions that the description of the Holy Ghost as a still small voice is real It is poetic but it is not poetry Only when my heart has been still and quiet in submission like a little child has the Spirit been clearly audible to my heart and mind King Benjamin taught us how those moments may come more often which they must in the perils we face He told us that there are things we can and must do to invite the blessing of that change to a childlike heart All of them have to do with doing what it takes to build greater faith in Jesus Christ and so qualify for the help of the Holy Ghost King Benjamin gave the reason for that And moreover I say unto you that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men only in and through the name of Christ the Lord Omnipotent 7What we need is faith in Him and to love Him We must know that He lives and who He is When we do we will love Him King Benjamin suggested how to know Him in these words which you have heard often For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart 8We come to love those we serve If we choose to begin to serve the Master out of even a glimmer of faith we will begin to know Him We will come to know His purposes for the people we serve for Him Even when they do not accept our offer to serve them we will feel His appreciation if we persist As we persist we will feel the need for the influence of the Holy Ghost because our task will seem beyond us Our humble prayer to our Heavenly Father will be answered The Holy Ghost has as a major purpose witnessing that Jesus is the Christ As we plead for help in His service the Holy Ghost will come and confirm our faith in Him Our faith in the Savior will increase And as we continue to serve Him we will come to love Him To be called to serve is a call to come to love the Master we serve It is a call to have our natures changed To keep the blessing of that change in our hearts will require determination effort and faith King Benjamin taught at least some of what that will require He said that to retain a remission of our sins from day to day we must feed the hungry clothe the naked visit the sick and help people spiritually and temporally 9 He warned that we must guard against even the feelings of contention entering into our hearts 10 He made it clear that the mighty change which comes through the Atonement working in us can diminish if we are not on guard against sin The Lord said in warning Therefore let the church take heed and pray always lest they fall into temptation yea and even let those who are sanctified take heed also 11Through sin the gift can be lost King Benjamin taught that we are responsible for the determined effort necessary to resist temptation He warned his people about specific temptations But after giving those warnings he put the obligation on them As often as we pray not to be overcome by temptation and to be delivered from evil we are responsible for ourselves Here are the words he spoke which are not his but from God And finally I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin for there are divers ways and means even so many that I cannot number them But this much I can tell you that if ye do not watch yourselves and your thoughts and your words and your deeds and observe the commandments of God and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord even unto the end of your lives ye must perish And now O man remember and perish not 12With the help of the Holy Ghost we can watch over ourselves We can pray to recognize and reject the first thoughts of sin We can pray to recognize a warning not to speak words which would hurt or tempt someone else And we can when we must pray for the humility and the faith to repent There will surely be some who hear my voice who will have this thought come into their minds But the temptations are too great for me I have resisted as long as I can For me the commandments are too hard The standard is too high That is not so The Savior is our Advocate with the Father He knows our weaknesses He knows how to succor those who are tempted 13I bear you my witness that the Savior lives and that He is the sure foundation I know that by acting on our faith in Him we can be cleansed and changed to become pure and strong as a little child I bear you my testimony that the Holy Ghost can lead us to truth and away from sin Joseph Smith saw Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son The Book of Mormon is the word of God and a witness of Jesus Christ as our Savior This is the true Church I know that we can choose the promised joy of eternal life however perilous the times In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Most of us have thought about how to prepare for storms We have seen and felt the suffering of women men and children and of the aged and the weak caught in hurricanes tsunamis wars and droughts One reaction is to ask How can I be prepared And there is a rush to buy and put away whatever people think they might need for the day they might face such calamities But there is another even more important preparation we must make for tests that are certain to come to each of us That preparation must be started far in advance because it takes time What we will need then can t be bought It can t be borrowed It doesn t store well And it has to have been used regularly and recently What we will need in our day of testing is a spiritual preparation It is to have developed faith in Jesus Christ so powerful that we can pass the test of life upon which everything for us in eternity depends That test is part of the purpose God had for us in the Creation The Prophet Joseph Smith gave us the Lord s description of the test we face Our Heavenly Father created the world with His Son Jesus Christ We have these words to tell us about the purpose of the Creation We will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell And we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them 1So the great test of life is to see whether we will hearken to and obey God s commands in the midst of the storms of life It is not to endure storms but to choose the right while they rage And the tragedy of life is to fail in that test and so fail to qualify to return in glory to our heavenly home We are the spirit children of a Heavenly Father He loved us and He taught us before we were born into this world He told us that He wished to give us all that He had To qualify for that gift we had to receive mortal bodies and be tested Because of those mortal bodies we would face pain sickness and death We would be subject to temptations through the desires and weaknesses that came with our mortal bodies Subtle and powerful forces of evil would tempt us to surrender to those temptations Life would have storms in which we would have to make choices using faith in things we could not see with our natural eyes We were promised that we would have Jehovah Jesus Christ as our Savior and Redeemer He would assure that we would all be resurrected And He would make it possible for us to pass the test of life if we exercised faith in Him by being obedient We shouted for joy at the good news A passage from the Book of Mormon another witness of Jesus Christ describes how hard the test is and what it will take to pass it Therefore cheer up your hearts and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life Wherefore my beloved brethren reconcile yourselves to the will of God and not to the will of the devil and the flesh and remember after ye are reconciled unto God that it is only in and through the grace of God that ye are saved Wherefore may God raise you from death by the power of the resurrection and also from everlasting death by the power of the atonement that ye may be received into the eternal kingdom of God that ye may praise him through grace divine Amen 2It will take unshakable faith in the Lord Jesus Christ to choose the way to eternal life It is by using that faith we can know the will of God It is by acting on that faith we build the strength to do the will of God And it is by exercising that faith in Jesus Christ that we can resist temptation and gain forgiveness through the Atonement We will need to have developed and nurtured faith in Jesus Christ long before Satan hits us as he will with doubts and appeals to our carnal desires and with lying voices saying that good is bad and that there is no sin Those spiritual storms are already raging We can expect that they will worsen until the Savior returns However much faith to obey God we now have we will need to strengthen it continually and keep it refreshed constantly We can do that by deciding now to be more quick to obey and more determined to endure Learning to start early and to be steady are the keys to spiritual preparation Procrastination and inconsistency are its mortal enemies Let me suggest to you four settings in which to practice quick and steady obedience One is the command to feast upon the word of God A second is to pray always A third is the commandment to be a full tithe payer And the fourth is to escape from sin and its terrible effects Each takes faith to start and then to persevere And all can strengthen your capacity to know and obey the Lord s commands You already have had the Lord s help to get started In August you received this promise from President Gordon B Hinckley if you would read the Book of Mormon through by the end of the year Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God 3That is the very promise of increased faith we need to be spiritually prepared But if we delayed the start of our obedience to that inspired invitation the number of pages we had to read each day grew larger If we then missed reading for even a few days the chance of failure grew That s why I chose to read ahead of my daily plan to be sure I will qualify for the promised blessings of the spirit of resolution and testimony of Jesus Christ When December ends I will have learned about starting at the moment a command from God comes and being steady in obedience More than that as I read in the Book of Mormon I will pray that the Holy Ghost will help me know what God would have me do There is a promise of that plea being answered in the book itself Wherefore I said unto you feast upon the words of Christ for behold the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do 4I will act quickly on what the Holy Ghost tells me I should do as I read and ponder the Book of Mormon When I complete the project in December I will have had many experiences of stretching my faith to be obedient And so my faith will be strengthened And I will know from my own experience what comes from going to the scriptures early and consistently to know what God wants me to do and then doing it If we do that we will be better prepared for the greater storms when they come We will then have a choice of what to do after January 1 We can choose to sigh with relief and say to ourselves I have built a great reservoir of faith by starting early and being steady in obedience I will store it away against the times when I will be tested in storms There is a better way to prepare because great faith has a short shelf life We could decide to persist in studying the words of Christ in the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets This is what I will do I will go back to the Book of Mormon and drink deeply and often And then I will be grateful for what the prophet s challenge and promise did to teach me how to gain greater faith and maintain it Personal prayer can also build our faith to do what God commands We are commanded to pray always that we will not be overcome Some of the protection we need will be direct intervention of God But more of it will come from building our faith to obey We can pray every day to know what God would have us do We can commit to start to do it quickly when the answer comes My experience is that He always answers such petitions Then we can choose to obey As we do we will build faith enough that we will not be overcome And we will gain the faith to go back again and again for further instruction When the storms come we will be ready to go and do what the Lord commands The Savior showed us a great example of such a prayer of submission He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane as He worked out the Atonement that His Father s will would be done He knew that His Father s will would be for Him to do what was so painful and so terrible that we cannot comprehend it He prayed not simply to accept the Father s will but to do it He showed us the way to pray in perfect and determined submission The principle of exercising faith early and steadily applies as well to the commandment to pay tithing We should not wait until the annual tithing settlement to decide to be a full tithe payer We can decide now It takes time to learn to control our spending with faith that what we have comes from God It takes faith to pay our tithing promptly and without procrastination If we decide now to be a full tithe payer and if we are steady in paying it blessings will flow throughout the year as well as at the time of tithing settlement By our decision now to be a full tithe payer and our steady efforts to obey we will be strengthened in our faith and in time our hearts will be softened It is that change in our hearts through the Atonement of Jesus Christ beyond the offering of our money or goods that makes it possible for the Lord to promise full tithe payers protection in the last days 5 We can have confidence that we will qualify for that blessing of protection if we commit now to pay a full tithe and are steady in doing it The same power of an early choice to exercise faith and to be persistent in obedience applies to gaining the faith to resist temptation and to gain forgiveness The best time to resist temptation is early The best time to repent is now The enemy of our souls will place thoughts in our minds to tempt us We can decide early to exercise faith to cast out evil thoughts before we act on them And we can choose quickly to repent when we do sin before Satan can weaken our faith and bind us Seeking forgiveness is always better now than later As my father lay in his bed near death I asked him if he didn t think it was a time to repent and pray for forgiveness for any sins that were not yet resolved with God He probably heard a little hint in my voice that he might fear death and the Judgment He just chuckled quietly smiled up at me and said Oh no Hal I ve been repenting as I went along Decisions now to exercise faith and be steady in obedience will in time produce great faith and assurance That is the spiritual preparedness we all will need And it will qualify us in the moments of crisis to receive the Lord s promise that if ye are prepared ye shall not fear 6That will be true when we face the storms of life and the prospect of death A loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son have given us all the help They can to pass the test of life set before us But we must decide to obey and then do it We build the faith to pass the tests of obedience over time and through our daily choices We can decide now to do quickly whatever God asks of us And we can decide to be steady in the small tests of obedience which build the faith to carry us through the great tests which will surely come I know that you and I are children of a loving Heavenly Father I know that His Son Jesus Christ lives and that He is our Savior and that He paid the price of all of our sins He was resurrected and He and Heavenly Father appeared to the boy Joseph Smith I know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God translated through the gift and power of God I know that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ I know that through the Holy Ghost we can learn what God would have us do I testify that He can give us the power to do what He asks of us whatever it is and whatever trials may come I pray that we will choose to obey the Lord quickly always in quiet times and in storms As we do our faith will be strengthened we will find peace in this life and we will gain the assurance that we and our families can qualify for eternal life in the world to come I so promise you in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My message is to those who are converts to the Church More than half the members of the Church today chose to be baptized after the age of eight So you are not the exception in the Church To you I wish to say how much the Lord loves you and trusts you And even more I wish to tell you how much He depends on you You felt His love at least to some degree when you were baptized Years ago I took a young man 20 years of age into the waters of baptism My companion and I had taught him the gospel He was the first in his family to hear the message of the restored gospel He asked to be baptized The testimony of the Spirit made him want to follow the example of the Savior who was baptized by John the Baptist even though He was without sin As I brought that young man up out of the waters of baptism he surprised me by throwing his arms around my neck and whispering in my ear tears streaming down his face I m clean I m clean That same young man after we laid our hands on his head with the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood and conferred on him the Holy Ghost said to me When you spoke those words I felt something like fire go down from the top of my head through my body all the way to my feet Your experience will have been unique to you but to some degree you felt the magnitude of the blessing which came to you Since then you have felt the reality of the promises made to you and the promises you made You have felt the cleansing that came from your baptism because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ And you have felt the change in your heart as the Holy Ghost has become your companion Your desires have begun to change When someone tells me that he or she is a convert to the Church I ask Has anyone else in your family accepted the gospel When the answer is Yes there follows an excited description of the happy miracle in the life of a parent or a brother or sister or a grandparent There is joy in knowing that someone in his or her family is sharing the blessing and the happiness When the answer is No so far I am the only member he or she will almost always speak of parents saying something like this No not yet But I am still trying And you can tell from the sound in the voice that the convert will never stop trying not ever The Lord knew you would have those feelings when He allowed you to receive the covenants which are blessing your life He knew you would feel a desire for your family to share the blessings you felt coming into the Church Even more He knew how that desire would increase when you came to know the joy of the promises He makes to us in sacred temples There for those who qualify He lets us make covenants with Him We promise to obey His commandments And He promises us if we are faithful that we may live with Him in glory in families forever in the world to come In His loving kindness He knew you would have a desire to be bound forever to your parents and their parents You may have had a grandfather like mine who always seemed to treasure my visits I thought I was his favorite grandchild until my cousins told me they felt the same way He is gone now All my grandparents and their ancestors have died Many of your ancestors died never having the chance to accept the gospel and to receive the blessings and promises you have received The Lord is fair and He is loving And so He prepared for you and me a way for us to have the desire of our hearts to offer to our ancestors all the blessings He has offered us The plan to make that possible has been in place from the beginning The Lord gave promises to His children long ago The very last book of the Old Testament is the book of the prophet Malachi And the last words are a sweet promise and a stern warning Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse 1Some of those words are crucial to understand The great and dreadful day of the Lord is the end of the world Jehovah the Messiah will come in glory The wicked will all be destroyed We live in the last days Time could be running out for us to do what we have promised to do It is important to know why the Lord promised to send Elijah Elijah was a great prophet with great power given him by God He held the greatest power God gives to His children he held the sealing power the power to bind on earth and have it bound in heaven God gave it to the Apostle Peter And the Lord kept His promise to send Elijah Elijah came to the Prophet Joseph Smith on April 3 1836 just after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple the first temple built after the Restoration of the gospel Joseph described the sacred moment Another great and glorious vision burst upon us for Elijah the prophet who was taken to heaven without tasting death stood before us and said Behold the time has fully come which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi testifying that he Elijah should be sent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near even at the doors 2As you came into the Church you have felt your heart being turned toward family both those who are living and those who are in the spirit world The Lord provided another vision to help you know what to do with those feelings After Joseph Smith the Lord called other prophets to lead His Church One was Joseph F Smith He saw in vision what happened in the spirit world when the Savior appeared there between the time of His death and His Resurrection 3 President Smith saw the joy of the spirits when they learned that the Savior had broken the bands of death and because of His Atonement they could be resurrected And he saw the Savior organize His servants among the spirits to preach His gospel to every spirit and offer the chance to choose the covenants and the blessings which are offered to you and which you want for your ancestors All are to have that chance President Smith also saw the leaders the Savior called to take the gospel to Heavenly Father s children in the spirit world He named some of them Father Adam Mother Eve Noah Abraham Ezekiel Elijah prophets we know from the Book of Mormon and some from the last days including Joseph Smith Brigham Young John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff Think of the power of those missionaries to teach the gospel and to touch the hearts of your ancestors It is not surprising that Wilford Woodruff said while he lived that he believed few if any of the ancestors of the Latter day Saints in the spirit world would choose to reject the message of salvation when they heard it 4Many of your deceased ancestors will have received a testimony that the message of the missionaries is true When you received that testimony you could ask the missionaries for baptism But those who are in the spirit world cannot The ordinances you so cherish are offered only in this world Someone in this world must go to a holy temple and accept the covenants on behalf of the person in the spirit world That is why we are under obligation to find the names of our ancestors and ensure that they are offered by us what they cannot receive there without our help For me knowing that turns my heart not only to my ancestors who wait but to the missionaries who teach them I will see those missionaries in the spirit world and so will you Think of a faithful missionary standing there with those he has loved and taught who are your ancestors Picture as I do the smile on the face of that missionary as you walk up to him and your ancestors whom he converted but could not baptize or have sealed to family until you came to the rescue I do not know what the protocol will be in such a place but I imagine arms thrown around your neck and tears of gratitude If you can imagine the smile of the missionary and your ancestor think of the Savior when you meet Him You will have that interview He paid the price of the sins of you and all of Heavenly Father s spirit children He is Jehovah He sent Elijah He conferred the powers of the priesthood to seal and to bless out of perfect love And He has trusted you by letting you hear the gospel in your lifetime giving you the chance to accept the obligation to offer it to those of your ancestors who did not have your priceless opportunity Think of the gratitude He has for those who pay the price in work and faith to find the names of their ancestors and who love them and Him enough to offer them eternal life in families the greatest of all the gifts of God He offered them an infinite sacrifice He will love and appreciate those who paid whatever price they could to allow their ancestors to choose His offer of eternal life Because your heart has already been turned the price may not seem high You begin by doing simple things Write down what you already know about your family You will need to write down the names of parents and their parents with the dates of birth or death or marriage When you can you will want to record the places Some of that you will know from memory But you can also ask relatives They may even have some certificates of births marriages or deaths Make copies and organize them If you learn stories about their lives write them down and keep them You are not just gathering names Those you never met in life will become friends you love Your heart will be bound to theirs forever You can start searching in the first few generations going back in time From that you will identify many of your ancestors who need your help Someone in your own ward or branch of the Church has been called to help you prepare those names for the temple There they can be offered the covenants which will free them from their spirit prisons and bind them in families your family forever Your opportunities and the obligations they create are remarkable in the whole history of the world There are more temples across the earth than there have ever been More people in all the world have felt the Spirit of Elijah move them to record the identities and facts of their ancestors lives There are more resources to search out your ancestors than there have ever been in the history of the world The Lord has poured out knowledge about how to make that information available worldwide through technology that a few years ago would have seemed a miracle With those opportunities there comes greater obligation to keep our trust with the Lord Where much is given much is required 5 After you find the first few generations the road will become more difficult The price will become greater As you go back in time the records become less complete As others of your family search out ancestors you will discover that the ancestor you find has already been offered the full blessings of the temple Then you will have a difficult and important choice to make You will be tempted to stop and leave the hard work of finding to others who are more expert or to another time in your life But you will also feel a tug on your heart to go on in the work hard as it will be As you decide remember that the names which will be so difficult to find are of real people to whom you owe your existence in this world and whom you will meet again in the spirit world When you were baptized your ancestors looked down on you with hope Perhaps after centuries they rejoiced to see one of their descendants make a covenant to find them and to offer them freedom In your reunion you will see in their eyes either gratitude or terrible disappointment Their hearts are bound to you Their hope is in your hands You will have more than your own strength as you choose to labor on to find them A few nights ago I had a dream I saw a piece of white paper with a name on it I did not know and a date I could only partially read I got up and went to the records of my family The last name on the slip of paper is from a line which came into my mother s ancestry 300 years ago in a place called Eaton Bray Someone is anxious for a long wait to end I have not yet found that person But I have found again the assurance that a loving God sends help in answer to prayer in this sacred work of redeeming our families which is His work and His glory and to which we have pledged our hearts I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In a chapel far from Salt Lake City in a place where a member of the Quorum of the Twelve rarely goes a father approached me He led his young son by the hand As they reached me he looked down at the boy called him by name and said nodding his head towards me This is an Apostle I could tell by the sound of the father s voice that he was hoping his son would feel more than that he was meeting a dignified visitor He hoped that his son would feel a conviction that priesthood keys were on the earth in the Lord s Church His son will need that conviction again and again He will need it when he opens a letter from some future prophet he has never seen calling him to a mission He will need it when he buries a child or a wife or a parent He will need it for courage to follow direction to serve He will need it for the comfort that comes from trusting a sealing power that binds forever Missionaries will invite investigators to meet a bishop or branch president today with the same intent They hope that the investigators will feel far more than that they have met a nice man or even a great man They will be praying that the investigators will feel a conviction that this apparently ordinary man holds priesthood keys in the Lord s Church The investigators will need that conviction when they go into the waters of baptism They will need it when they pay tithing They will need that conviction when the bishop is inspired to give them a calling They will need it when they see him presiding in the sacrament meeting and when he nourishes them by teaching the gospel And so missionaries and fathers and all of us who serve others in the true Church want to help those we love gain a lasting testimony that the keys of the priesthood are held by the Lord s servants in His Church I speak today to encourage all who labor to instill and strengthen that testimony It will help to recognize some things First God is persistent and generous in offering the blessings of priesthood power to His children Second His children must choose for themselves to qualify for and receive those blessings And third Satan the enemy of righteousness has from the beginning tried to undermine the faith necessary to receive the blessings made possible by priesthood power I learned about those realities from a wise teacher nearly 25 years ago I spoke in an ancient theater in Ephesus Bright sunlight flooded the ground where the Apostle Paul had stood to preach My topic was Paul the Apostle called of God The audience was hundreds of Latter day Saints They were arranged on the rows of stone benches the Ephesians sat upon more than a millennium before Among them were two living Apostles Elder Mark E Petersen and Elder James E Faust As you can imagine I had prepared carefully I had read the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles both those of Paul and his fellow Apostles I had read and pondered Paul s Epistle to the Ephesians I tried my best to honor Paul and his office After the talk a number of people said kind things Both of the living Apostles were generous in their comments But later Elder Faust took me aside and with a smile and with softness in his voice said That was a good talk But you left out the most important thing you could have said I asked him what that was Weeks later he consented to tell me His answer has been teaching me ever since He said that I could have told the people that if the Saints who heard Paul had possessed a testimony of the value and the power of the keys he held perhaps the Apostles would not have had to be taken from the earth That sent me back to Paul s letter to the Ephesians I could see that Paul wanted the people to feel the value of the chain of priesthood keys reaching from the Lord through His Apostles to them the members of the Lord s Church Paul was trying to build a testimony of those keys Paul testified to the Ephesians that Christ was at the head of His Church And he taught that the Savior built His Church on a foundation of apostles and prophets who hold all the keys of the priesthood Despite the clarity and the power of his teaching and his example Paul knew that an apostasy would come He knew that apostles and prophets would be taken from the earth And he knew that they would in some great future day be restored He wrote of that time to the Ephesians speaking of what the Lord would do That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him 1Paul looked forward to the ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith when the heavens would be opened again It happened John the Baptist came and conferred on mortals the priesthood of Aaron and the keys of the ministering of angels and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins Ancient apostles and prophets returned and conferred upon Joseph the keys they held in mortality Mortal men were ordained to the holy apostleship in February of 1835 Priesthood keys were given to the Twelve Apostles in the latter part of March 1844 The Prophet Joseph Smith knew that his death was imminent He knew that the precious priesthood keys and the apostleship must not be and would not be lost again One of the Apostles Wilford Woodruff left us this account of what happened in Nauvoo as the Prophet spoke to the Twelve On that occasion the Prophet Joseph rose up and said to us Brethren I have desired to live to see this temple built I shall never live to see it but you will I have sealed upon your heads all the keys of the kingdom of God I have sealed upon you every key power principle that the God of heaven has revealed to me Now no matter where I may go or what I may do the kingdom rests upon you 2Every prophet that followed Joseph from Brigham Young to President Hinckley has held and exercised those keys and has held the sacred apostleship But just as in the time of Paul the power of those priesthood keys for us requires our faith We have to know by inspiration that the priesthood keys are held by those who lead and serve us That requires the witness of the Spirit And that depends upon our testimony that Jesus is the Christ and that He lives and leads His Church We must also know for ourselves that the Lord restored His Church and the priesthood keys through the Prophet Joseph Smith And we must have an assurance through the Holy Ghost refreshed often that those keys have been passed without interruption to the living prophet and that the Lord blesses and directs His people through the line of priesthood keys which reaches down through presidents of stakes and of districts and through bishops and branch presidents to us wherever we are and no matter how far from the prophet and the apostles That is not easy today It was not easy in the days of Paul It has always been hard to recognize in fallible human beings the authorized servants of God Paul must have seemed an ordinary man to many Joseph Smith s cheerful disposition was seen by some as not fitting their expectations for a prophet of God Satan will always work on the Saints of God to undermine their faith in priesthood keys One way he does it is to point out the humanity of those who hold them He can in that way weaken our testimony and so cut us loose from the line of keys by which the Lord ties us to Him and can take us and our families home to Him and to our Heavenly Father Satan succeeded in undermining the testimony of men who had with Joseph Smith seen the heavens opened and heard the voices of angels The evidence of their physical eyes and ears was not enough when they no longer could feel the testimony that the priesthood keys were still in place with Joseph The warning for us is plain If we look for human frailty in humans we will always find it When we focus on finding the frailties of those who hold priesthood keys we run risks for ourselves When we speak or write to others of such frailties we put them at risk We live in a world where finding fault in others seems to be the favorite blood sport It has long been the basis of political campaign strategy It is the theme of much television programming across the world It sells newspapers Whenever we meet anyone our first almost unconscious reaction may be to look for imperfections To keep ourselves grounded in the Lord s Church we can and must train our eyes to recognize the power of the Lord in the service of those He has called We must be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost And we need to pray for the Holy Ghost to help us know that men who lead us hold this power For me such prayers are most often answered when I am fully engaged in the Lord s service myself It happened in the aftermath of a disaster A dam in Idaho broke on a June day A wall of water struck the communities below it Thousands of people mostly Latter day Saints fled their homes to go to safety I was there as the people faced the terrible task of recovery I saw the stake president gather his bishops to lead the people We were cut off in those first days from any supervision from outside I was in the meeting of local leaders when a director from the federal disaster agency arrived He tried to take over the meeting With great force he began to list the things that he said needed to be done As he read aloud each item the stake president who was sitting near him said quietly We ve already done that After that went on for five or ten minutes the federal official grew silent and sat down He listened quietly as the stake president took reports from the bishops and gave directions For the meeting the next day the federal disaster official arrived early He sat toward the back The stake president began the meeting He took more reports and he gave instructions After a few minutes the federal official who had come with all the authority and resources of his great agency said President Ricks what would you like us to do He recognized power I saw more I recognized the evidence of keys and the faith that unlocks their power It happened again when a man and his wife arrived back in town just after the dam had broken They didn t go to their home They went first to find their bishop He was covered in mud leading his members in mucking out homes They asked what he would have them do They went to work Much later they took a few minutes to check on their own house It was gone So they went back to work wherever their bishop asked them to help They knew where to go to get the Lord s direction for service in His Church I learned then as I have since how the stakes of Zion become places of safety They become like a great family united caring for each other It comes by simple faith By faith they are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost As they continue to keep the commandments that gift becomes constant They can recognize spiritual things It becomes easier to see the power of God working through the common people God calls to serve and lead them Hearts are softened Strangers become fellow citizens in the Lord s kingdom united in loving bonds That happy condition will not last without a constant renewal of faith The bishop we love will be released as will the stake president The Apostles we followed in faith will be taken home to the God who called them With those continual changes comes a great opportunity We can act to qualify for the revelation that allows us to know that the keys are being passed by God from one person to another We can seek to have that experience again and again And we must in order to receive the blessings God has for us and wants us to offer to others The answer to your prayer is not likely to be as dramatic as it was when some saw Brigham Young as he spoke take on the appearance of the martyred Prophet Joseph But it can be as sure And with that spiritual assurance will come peace and power You will know again that this is the Lord s true and living Church that He leads it through His ordained servants and that He cares about us If enough of us exercise that faith and receive those assurances God will lift up those who lead us and so bless our lives and our families We will become what Paul so wanted for those he served built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone 3I testify I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior and that He lives I know that He is the rock upon which this His true Church stands In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
When I was a young man I served as counselor to a wise district president in the Church He tried to teach me One of the things I remember wondering about was this advice he gave When you meet someone treat them as if they were in serious trouble and you will be right more than half the time I thought then that he was pessimistic Now more than 40 years later I can see how well he understood the world and life As time passes the world grows more challenging and our physical capacities slowly diminish with age It is clear that we will need more than human strength The Psalmist was right But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble 1The restored gospel of Jesus Christ gives us help in knowing how to qualify for the strength of the Lord as we deal with adversity It tells us why we face tests in life And even more importantly it tells us how to get protection and help from the Lord We have trials to face because our Heavenly Father loves us His purpose is to help us qualify for the blessing of living with Him and His Son Jesus Christ forever in glory and in families To qualify for that gift we had to receive a mortal body With that mortality we understood that we would be tested by temptations and by difficulties The restored gospel not only teaches us why we must be tested but it makes clear to us what the test is The Prophet Joseph Smith gave us an explanation By revelation he was able to record words spoken at the Creation of the world They are about us those of the spirit children of our Heavenly Father who would come into mortality Here are the words And we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them 2That explanation helps us understand why we face trials in life They give us the opportunity to prove ourselves faithful to God So many things beat upon us in a lifetime that simply enduring may seem almost beyond us That s what the words in the scripture Ye must endure to the end 3 seemed to mean to me when I first read them It sounded grim like sitting still and holding on to the arms of the chair while someone pulled out my tooth It can surely seem that way to a family depending on crops when there is no rain They may wonder How long can we hold on It can seem that way to a youth faced with resisting the rising flood of filth and temptation It can seem that way to a young man struggling to get the training he needs for a job to support a wife and family It can seem that way to a person who can t find a job or who has lost job after job as businesses close their doors It can seem that way to a person faced with the erosion of health and physical strength which may come early or late in life for them or for those they love But the test a loving God has set before us is not to see if we can endure difficulty It is to see if we can endure it well We pass the test by showing that we remembered Him and the commandments He gave us And to endure well is to keep those commandments whatever the opposition whatever the temptation and whatever the tumult around us We have that clear understanding because the restored gospel makes the plan of happiness so plain That clarity lets us see what help we need We need strength beyond ourselves to keep the commandments in whatever circumstance life brings to us For some it may be poverty but for others it may be prosperity It may be the ravages of age or the exuberance of youth The combination of trials and their duration are as varied as are the children of our Heavenly Father No two are alike But what is being tested is the same at all times in our lives and for every person will we do whatsoever the Lord our God will command us Knowing why we are tested and what the test is tells us how to get help We have to go to God He gives us the commandments And we will need more than our own strength to keep them Again the restored gospel makes plain the simple things we need to do And it gives us confidence that the help we need will come if we do those things early and persistently long before the moment of crisis The first the middle and the last thing to do is to pray The Savior told us how One of the clearest instructions is in 3 Nephi Behold verily verily I say unto you ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation for Satan desireth to have you that he may sift you as wheat Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name which is right believing that ye shall receive behold it shall be given unto you Pray in your families unto the Father always in my name that your wives and your children may be blessed 4 So we must pray always Another simple thing to do which allows God to give us strength is to feast on the word of God read and ponder the standard works of the Church and the words of living prophets There is a promise of help from God that comes with that daily practice Faithful study of scriptures brings the Holy Ghost to us The promise is given in the Book of Mormon but it applies as well to all the words of God that He has given and will give us through His prophets Behold I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things and ponder it in your hearts And when ye shall receive these things I would exhort you that ye would ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ if these things are not true and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things 5We should claim the promise not only once nor only for the Book of Mormon The promise is sure The power of the Holy Ghost is real It will come again and again And one overriding truth it will always testify to is that Jesus is the Christ That testimony will draw us to the Savior and to accepting the help He offers to all who are being tested in the crucible of mortality More than once He has said that He would gather us to Him as a hen would gather her chickens under her wings He says that we must choose to come to Him in meekness and with enough faith in Him to repent with full purpose of heart 6One way to do that is to gather with the Saints in His Church Go to your meetings even when it seems hard If you are determined He will help you find the strength to do it A member wrote to me from England When her bishop asked if she would accept a call to teach early morning seminary he told her she d better pray about it before she accepted She did She accepted When she met the parents for the first time the bishop stood beside her She announced that she felt the program should go to five days a week Some parents looked doubtful One person said They won t come They ll vote with their feet Well the doubt was half right The students did vote with their feet But their attendance in those cold and dark morning hours is now above 90 percent That teacher and her bishop believed that if the students would start to come they would be strengthened by power more than their own It came That power will protect them when they go to places where they will be the only Latter day Saints They will not be alone nor without strength because they accepted the invitation to gather with the Saints when it was not easy That strength is given to those who are older as well as the young I know a widow more than 90 years of age She is in a wheelchair She prays as you do pleading for help to solve problems beyond her human power to resolve The answer is a feeling in her heart It draws her to keep a commandment And behold ye shall meet together oft 7 So she finds a way to get to her meetings People who attend there have told me We are so glad to see her She brings such a spirit with her She partakes of the sacrament and she renews a covenant She remembers the Savior and she tries to keep His commandments And so she takes His Spirit with her always Her problems may not be resolved Most of them come from the choices of others and even the Heavenly Father who hears her prayers and loves her cannot force others to choose the right But He can send her to the safety of the Savior and the promise of His Spirit to be with her And so I am sure that she will in the strength of the Lord pass the test she faces because she keeps the commandment to gather often with the Saints That is both the evidence that she is enduring well and the source of her strength for what lies ahead There is another simple thing to do The Lord s Church has been restored and so any call to serve in it is a call to serve Him That bishop in England was so wise He asked the woman to pray about her call to serve He knew what answer she would receive It would be an invitation from the Father and His Beloved Son He knew what she has learned by responding to the call from the Master In His service the Holy Ghost comes as a companion to those who try to do the best they can She must have felt that as she stood before the parents and when she saw the students vote with their feet What looked hard almost impossible under her own power became a joy in the strength of the Lord When she reads and ponders over the scriptures and prays to prepare for those classes she knows that the Savior has asked the Father to send her the Holy Ghost just as He promised His disciples He would at the Last Supper when He knew what trials they would face and that He must leave them He did not leave them comfortless He promised them the Holy Ghost and He promises it to us in His service So whenever the invitation to serve comes take it It brings with it help to pass tests far beyond those of that call Now not all have formal calls But every disciple serves the Master by bearing testimony and being kind to people around them All have promised in the waters of baptism to do that And all will gain the companionship of the Spirit as they persist in keeping their commitments with God In the Master s service you will come to know and love Him You will if you persevere in prayer and faithful service begin to sense that the Holy Ghost has become a companion Many of us have for a period given such service and felt that companionship If you think back on that time you will remember that there were changes in you The temptation to do evil seemed to lessen The desire to do good increased Those who knew you best and loved you may have said You have become more kind more patient You don t seem to be the same person You weren t the same person because the Atonement of Jesus Christ is real And the promise is real that we can become new changed and better And we can become stronger for the tests of life We then go in the strength of the Lord a strength developed in His service He goes with us And in time we become His tested and strengthened disciples You will then notice a change in your prayers They will become more fervent and more frequent The words you speak will have a different meaning to you By commandment we always pray to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ But you will feel a greater confidence as you pray to the Father knowing that you go to Him as a trusted and proven disciple of Jesus Christ The Father will grant you greater peace and strength in this life and with it a happy anticipation of hearing the words when the test of life is over Well done thou good and faithful servant 8I know that God the Father lives I testify that He hears and answers our every prayer I know that His Son Jesus Christ paid the price of all of our sins and that He wants us to come to Him I know that the Father and the Son want us to pass the tests of life I testify that They have prepared the way for us Through the Restoration of the gospel in the last days the way is made clear for us We can know the commandments We have the right to claim the promise of the companionship of the Holy Ghost in the true Church of Jesus Christ And we can endure well In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On the evening before he was martyred in Carthage the Prophet Joseph Smith bore testimony to his guards He testified of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon He bore witness of the administration of angels and that the kingdom of God was again established upon the earth I wonder if any of those guards prayed that night The Holy Ghost was ready to tell them that the remarkable message was true With a testimony of the Spirit they would have known that they should ask for baptism And then they could have received the priceless gift of the Holy Ghost With that gift they could know the truth of all things I wonder if any of them sensed that night how close they were to starting down the only path which would lead them to the Savior in the world to come to see His face with pleasure and hear the words Come unto me ye blessed there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father 1We all have people we love Think of them now They may be our children or our grandchildren Perhaps you think of your husband or your wife It may be someone you are teaching as a missionary It may be a friend You want with all your heart to have them someday hear those words from the Master And for that blessing to come they will need that testimony offered by the Prophet in Carthage burning in their hearts through all the tests of life as it did in his To begin we can offer them the testimony of eyewitnesses The Lord gave others to stand with Joseph to verify what the Lord had done They were with the Prophet when the heavens were opened Oliver Cowdery preached the first missionary sermon the first Sunday after the Church was organized He went into the mission field to proclaim what he knew by what he saw and heard and felt With two others he signed a testimony which they never denied Their witness is printed in the front of the Book of Mormon Be it known unto all nations kindreds tongues and people unto whom this work shall come That we through the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ have seen the plates which contain this record which is a record of the people of Nephi and also of the Lamanites their brethren and also of the people of Jared who came from the tower of which hath been spoken And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God for his voice hath declared it unto us wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates and they have been shown unto us by the power of God and not of man And we declare with words of soberness that an angel of God came down from heaven and he brought and laid before our eyes that we beheld and saw the plates and the engravings thereon and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ that we beheld and bear record that these things are true And it is marvelous in our eyes Nevertheless the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it wherefore to be obedient unto the commandments of God we bear testimony of these things And we know that if we are faithful in Christ we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men and be found spotless before the judgment seat of Christ and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens And the honor be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost which is one God Amen Oliver Cowdery David Whitmer Martin Harris 2Those you love can have more than the physical evidence given those witnesses by what they saw and heard Those three witnesses had something more something we all need The Holy Ghost bore witness to their minds and hearts that what they saw and heard was true The Spirit told them that the angel was from God and that the voice was that of the Lord Jesus Christ That witness of the Spirit was given to them and many who were not there It is a witness that can if we qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost be ours and stay with us forever The Three Witnesses never denied their testimony of the Book of Mormon They could not because they knew it was true They made sacrifices and faced difficulties beyond what most people ever know Oliver Cowdery gave the same testimony about the divine origin of the Book of Mormon as he lay dying But in the times of trial they wavered in their faith that Joseph was still God s prophet and that the only way to come unto the Savior was through His restored Church That they continued to affirm what they saw and heard in that marvelous experience during long periods of estrangement from the Church and from Joseph makes their testimony more powerful The Lord gave the witness of the Spirit without the same physical evidence to others who were severely tested by opposition and tribulation Brigham Young John Taylor Heber C Kimball and many others stayed steady in their testimony They endured in faith because they paid the price to keep the companionship of the Holy Ghost and the burning testimony He alone brings Because of that they had more than a memory of the moment when the Spirit whispered to their minds and hearts that God lived that Jesus was the Christ and that Joseph was their prophet And they had more than a memory of the feeling of peace and the joy that witness brought Because they qualified for the companionship of the Holy Ghost they could say in every circumstance however difficult I knew it then I felt it was true then I feel so now They did some simple things to keep that testimony bright and vibrant We can teach those we love to do those same things Done faithfully they allow the Holy Ghost to be a constant companion And we can promise those we love that they will feel joy and peace as the Spirit confirms truth if they ask for that blessing in faith Now we teach things of the Spirit best with both example and testimony I don t remember much of what my parents said about the Holy Ghost but I remember what I felt when I saw them do the things which brought the Holy Ghost into our home Here are some things you can teach those you love with your example and testimony with confidence that the Lord will send the Spirit to confirm truth to their minds and to their hearts Teach them to pray to the Father in faith in the name of Jesus Christ There is a promise in the book of Omni about that And now my beloved brethren I would that ye should come unto Christ who is the Holy One of Israel and partake of his salvation and the power of his redemption Yea come unto him and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him and continue in fasting and praying and endure to the end and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved 3The young Joseph Smith showed us how to pray that way He believed in the promise he read in the book of James 4 He went to the grove with faith that his prayer would be answered He wanted to know which church to join He was submissive enough to be ready to do whatever he was told to do So he prayed as we must already committed to obey What he was told to do required his whole soul and finally his life He endured during the 24 years that followed by continuing to pray with that childlike faith and humility We can teach those we love to pray with the intent to obey We can promise them they will gain the companionship of the Holy Ghost The Spirit will testify the truth to their hearts every time they read in the scriptures which came to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith And the Spirit will confirm again that God spoke through His prophet Teach them to ponder the scriptures every day with faith that they will be taught by the Spirit Now listen to these words from scripture translated by Joseph Smith Expect to be taught now what you should do You will feel impressions of how you should approach the scriptures and how you should teach that to the people you love Wherefore ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men Wherefore if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life 5The Prophet Joseph taught us what it means to feast on the scriptures He said that the Book of Mormon would get a man nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other book 6 You will grow closer to the Lord and love Him more That is the promise in Jacob 3 2 O all ye that are pure in heart lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God and feast upon his love for ye may if your minds are firm forever You and those you love will receive the word of God by obeying it That will allow them to feel His love That is one of the great blessings of the gift of the Holy Ghost When we feel that love we can know that our course in life is approved of God That is the feast of the delicious fruit described in the Book of Mormon 7Teach them to sacrifice to build up the kingdom of God That sacrifice brings the testimony of the Spirit The Prophet Joseph translated a wonderful promise written by a prophet long ago for our time And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb and whoso shall publish peace yea tidings of great joy how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be 8All can claim that promise The youngest and the newest member can seek to build up the kingdom of God Zion is made up of individuals and families When their faith increases the kingdom is established more firmly We can try to help with that every day Even the smallest act to build faith in another person or in a family qualifies us for the gift and power of the Holy Ghost The Holy Ghost testifies of truth Therefore in our service our faith increases that Jesus is the Christ that our Heavenly Father lives and loves us and that Joseph was Their prophet You can expect that every time you go to a home to build faith as a home teacher or a visiting teacher or a friend Some may not feel that blessing in their Church service But that is because they have focused on the mechanics and not the glorious opportunity of publishing peace yea tidings of great joy to God s children in His kingdom When that is how we see our service we will not only be lifted up at the last day but refreshed and encouraged along the way And the Spirit will testify that this is the Lord s kingdom restored in the latter days Teach them to love others by serving others That brings the Spirit The Prophet Joseph taught that and he lived it Of the many examples recorded of his loving nature the one which most touches me occurred in Carthage Jail the night before his death One of the men who went there with him was Dan Jones The Prophet sensed the danger from the mob He had reason to turn inward to think of himself and his own peril Instead his heart turned outward to comfort someone else When all were apparently fast asleep Joseph whispered to Dan Jones are you afraid to die Dan answered Has that time come think you Engaged in such a cause I do not think that death would have many terrors Joseph replied You will yet see Wales and fulfill the mission appointed you before you die 9Dan Jones survived to serve missions in Wales Thousands of Welsh converts came to Zion Some were gifted singers They were among the first members of what became the Tabernacle Choir When we hear the choir sing I hope we remember Dan Jones the faithful friend of the Prophet Joseph Teach those you love to remember Joseph s comfort given when he needed comfort When we comfort others out of our faith in the Lord He sends the Comforter to us And the Comforter the Holy Ghost gave Joseph the power to give prophetic and loving encouragement Joseph showed in his loving kindness the truth of the words from the Book of Mormon Wherefore cleave unto charity which is the greatest of all for all things must fail But charity is the pure love of Christ and it endureth forever and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day it shall be well with him 10The Prophet Joseph is an example and a teacher of enduring well in faith I do not worship him but I thank and love him as the Lord s prophet of the Restoration He has helped me pray with the intent to obey I am better able to feast in the word and the love of God Because of him I feel the Holy Ghost more often in the moments when I try to build the faith of a person in the Lord s kingdom And because of what I know of the Prophet Joseph and the scriptures which were revealed through him I more often feel the love of God for His children and of His for me when I reach down to lift someone up My prayer is that we and those we love will endure in faith in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and in His kingdom I pray that we will keep the promise as we take the sacrament to always remember Him so we may always have His Spirit to be with us I pray that in family home evenings and in missionary discussions and in all the times we worship together we will invite the Holy Spirit by what we do and what we say and by what we are I testify that God lives I know that Jesus Christ lives and that He is our Savior This is His Church Joseph was His prophet President Gordon B Hinckley is His prophet today I know this by the Spirit which tells me that it is true I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
All of us who are under the baptismal covenant have promised to offer the gospel to others 1 Sometimes fear of rejection or of giving offense looms before us like an impassable obstacle Yet some members clear that barrier with ease I have observed them carefully in my travels I can picture some of them now Saturday is a market day across the world In the countryside of Ghana in Ecuador and in the Philippine Islands countless people bring the produce of their farms and their handicrafts to a town to sell They talk with those they meet on the road And they visit with those near them as they wait for someone to buy Much of the talk is about the struggles of existence of breaking out of poverty and sometimes about danger Among those on the roads and in the markets are Latter day Saints Much of their talk with those they meet would be the same as you would hear anywhere in the world Where are you from Is that your son with you How many children do you have But there will be a difference in the Latter day Saints It would be noticeable in their eyes as much as in their words They listen carefully with the look of someone who cares about the answers to questions and who cares about the person If the conversation lasts more than a few minutes it would turn to things that matter deeply to both of them They would talk of what they believe brings happiness and what brings sadness And the talk would turn to hopes for this life and the next The Latter day Saint would express quiet assurance Not every time but sometimes the Latter day Saint would be asked Why are you so much at peace How do you know these things you say you know And then there would come a quiet answer Perhaps it would be about Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ appearing to the young boy Joseph Smith It might be about the resurrected Savior s loving ministry as described in the Book of Mormon to common people who had faith in Him and who loved Him as we do If you could hear such a conversation which reaches spiritual things in a marketplace or on a street you might ask How could I do that How could I become better at sharing my faith with those who do not yet feel what I feel It is a question for each of us who are members That same question is on the mind of every bishop and branch president in the Church who now has the charge to lead missionary work among his people The answer to that question is at the heart of the harvest which will come I ve studied carefully and prayerfully some who are remarkably faithful and effective witnesses of the Savior and His Church Their stories are inspiring One humble man was called as the president of a tiny branch There were so few members he could not see how the branch could function He walked into a grove of trees to pray He asked God what he should do An answer came He and the few members began inviting friends to join with them In a year hundreds had come into the waters of baptism and become fellow citizens in the Lord s Church I know a man who travels almost every week in his work On any day there are missionaries somewhere in the world teaching someone he met There is another man who seems undeterred by how many he must speak to before any of them wish to be taught by the missionaries He doesn t count the cost in his effort but only the happiness of those whose lives are changed There is no single pattern in what they do There is no common technique Some always carry a Book of Mormon to give away Others set a date to find someone for the missionaries to teach Another has found questions which draw out feelings about what matters most in life to a person Each has prayed to know what to do They each seem to get a different answer suited especially to them and to the people they meet But in one way they are all alike It is this they have a common way of seeing who they are They can do what they have been inspired to do because of who they are To do what we are to do we will have to become like them in at least two ways First they feel that they are the beloved children of a loving Heavenly Father Because of that they turn to Him easily and often in prayer They expect to receive His personal direction They obey in meekness and humility as the children of a perfect parent He is close to them Second they are the grateful disciples of the resurrected Jesus Christ They know for themselves that the Atonement is real and necessary for all They have felt cleansed through baptism by those in authority and the receipt of the Holy Ghost for themselves And because of the peace they have experienced they are like the sons of Mosiah desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature for they could not bear that any human soul should perish yea even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble 2Those who speak easily and often of the restored gospel prize what it has meant to them They think of that great blessing often It is the memory of the gift they have received which makes them eager for others to receive it They have felt the love of the Savior For them these words are their daily hourly reality There is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment He that feareth is not made perfect in love We love him because he first loved us 3Even having felt that love the true disciple sometimes feels anxiety The Apostle John was clear about that fear will be gone when we are made perfect in love We can pray for that gift of perfect love We can pray with confidence that we can feel the Savior s love for us and for all we meet He loved us and them enough to pay the price of all our sins It is one thing to believe that It is something far more to have our hearts changed to feel it every moment The command to pray to feel the Savior s love is also a promise Listen Wherefore my beloved brethren if ye have not charity ye are nothing for charity never faileth Wherefore cleave unto charity which is the greatest of all for all things must fail But charity is the pure love of Christ and it endureth forever and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day it shall be well with him Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure 4The Lord trusts His true disciples He sends prepared people to His prepared servants You have had the experience as have I of meeting people where you were sure the meeting could not have been by chance I have a friend who prays every day to meet someone who is prepared to receive the gospel He carries with him a copy of the Book of Mormon The night before a short trip recently he decided not to take a copy with him but instead to carry what is called a pass along card But in the morning a spiritual impression came Take a Book of Mormon with you He put one in his bag A woman he knew sat next to him on the plane and he wondered Is this the one She rode with him again on the return trip Now he thought How should I bring the gospel up Instead she said to him You pay tithing to your Church don t you He said that he did She said that she was supposed to pay tithing to her church but she didn t And then she said What is this about the Book of Mormon He explained that it was scripture another witness of Jesus Christ translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith She seemed interested So he reached down into his bag and said I was impressed to bring this book with me I think it is for you She began to read it As they parted she said You and I are going to have to have more conversations about this What my friend could not know but God did was that she was looking for a church God knew she had watched my friend and wondered what about his church made him so happy God knew she would ask about the Book of Mormon and He knew she would be willing to be taught by the missionaries She was prepared So was my friend And so can you and I be Your worthiness and your desire will shine in your face and your eyes You will be excited about the Lord s Church and His work and it will show You will be His disciple 24 hours a day in every situation You won t need to build up your courage for one great moment to speak to someone and then retreat The fact that most people are not interested in the restored gospel will have little bearing on what you do and say Speaking what you believe will be part of what you are My father was like that He was a scientist He lectured to audiences in countries around the world Once I read a talk he had given to a large scientific convention In it he referred to creation and a Creator as he talked about his science I knew that few if any in that audience would have shared his faith So I said to him with wonder and admiration Dad you bore your testimony He looked at me with surprise on his face and said Did I He had not even known that he was being brave He simply said what he knew was true When he bore testimony even those who rejected it knew it came not by design but because it was part of him He was what he was wherever he was That is the mark of every person who is bold and effective in sharing the gospel They see themselves as children of a loving living Father in Heaven And they see themselves as disciples of Jesus Christ It takes no discipline for them to pray They do it naturally It is no special effort to remember the Savior His love for them and theirs for Him is always with them That is who they are and how they see themselves and see those around them Now that may seem to us to require a great change but we can be confident that it will come The change in individual members is happening across the Church in every nation This is the great time foreseen by prophets since the Creation The restored gospel will go to every nation The Savior sent these words to the Prophet Joseph Smith I have sent forth mine angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel who hath appeared unto some and hath committed it unto man who shall appear unto many that dwell on the earth And this gospel shall be preached unto every nation and kindred and tongue and people 5Whatever tumults occur we can know that God will set bounds to fulfill His promises He not just men has the ultimate control of nations and of events to allow His purposes to be fulfilled Among every people and every nation there will be raised up those who serve with absolute assurance that they are children of God and who have become purified disciples of the resurrected Christ in His Church A few years ago I spoke to the missionaries in the training center in Japan I promised them then that a great day would dawn in that nation I said that there would be a great increase in the members speaking eagerly to those they met of their testimony of the restored gospel My thought then was that the courage to speak would come from an increased admiration for the Church in that land I know now that the great miracle a mighty change will come inside the members not in the world around them They and members across the earth will love and listen and talk and testify out of changed hearts Bishops and branch presidents will lead them by example The harvest of souls will be great and it will be safe in the Lord s hands 6To be part of that miracle you must not wait until you feel closer to Heavenly Father or until you are sure that you have been purified through the Atonement of Jesus Christ Pray for the chance to encounter people who sense there could be something better in their lives Pray to know what you should do to help them Your prayers will be answered You will meet people prepared by the Lord You will find yourself feeling and saying things beyond your past experience And then in time you will feel yourself drawing closer to your Heavenly Father and you will feel the cleansing and the forgiveness the Savior promises His faithful witnesses And you will feel His approval knowing you have done what He asked of you because He loves you and trusts you I am grateful to live in such a time I am grateful to know that you and I are loved children of a glorified Heavenly Father I testify that Jesus is the Christ that He is my Savior and yours and the Savior of all the people you will ever meet The Father and the Son came to the Prophet Joseph Smith The keys of the priesthood were restored and the last great gathering has begun I know that is true In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Not long ago a young man I did not know approached me in a crowded place He said quietly but with great intensity Elder Eyring I have just been called as the president of my elders quorum What advice do you have for me I was sure that what he needed to know and to feel I couldn t give him there with the people rushing past us And so I said I will give you my counsel in general conference That young man is not alone in wanting help Thousands of members of the Church across the earth are called every week to serve many of them recent converts The variety in their callings is great and the variety of their previous Church experience is even greater If you are the one who calls them or trains them or simply cares about them as we all do there are some things to know about how to help them succeed You may think first of being sure that they get a handbook lesson manuals or the records they are to keep You might even give them a list of the times and the places of the meetings they are to attend Then you might be about to tell them how their work will be evaluated when you will notice concern in their eyes You see even the newest member of the Church can sense that a call to service should be primarily a matter of the heart It is by giving our whole hearts to the Master and keeping His commandments that we come to know Him In time through the power of the Atonement our hearts are changed and we can become like Him So there is a better way to help those who are called than descriptions of what they are to do What they will need even more than to be trained in their duties is to see with spiritual eyes what it means to be called to serve in the restored Church of Jesus Christ This is the kingdom of God on the earth Because of that it has a power beyond any other endeavor in which humans can engage That power depends on the faith of those called to serve in it And so to everyone man or woman girl or boy who has been called or who will yet be I give you my counsel There are a few things you must come to know are true I will try to put them in words Only the Lord through the Holy Ghost can put them deep in your heart Here they are First you are called of God The Lord knows you He knows whom He would have serve in every position in His Church He chose you He has prepared a way so that He could issue your call He restored the keys of the priesthood to Joseph Smith Those keys have been passed down in an unbroken line to President Hinckley Through those keys other priesthood servants were given keys to preside in stakes and wards in districts and branches It was through those keys that the Lord called you Those keys confer a right to revelation And revelation comes in answer to prayer The person who was inspired to recommend you for this call didn t do it because they liked you or because they needed someone to do a particular task They prayed and felt an answer that you were the one to be called The person who called you did not issue the call simply because he learned by interviewing you that you were worthy and willing to serve He prayed to know the Lord s will for you It was prayer and revelation to those authorized of the Lord which brought you here Your call is an example of a source of power unique to the Lord s Church Men and women are called of God by prophecy and by the laying on of hands by those God has authorized You are called to represent the Savior Your voice to testify becomes the same as His voice your hands to lift the same as His hands His work is to bless His Father s spirit children with the opportunity to choose eternal life So your calling is to bless lives That will be true even in the most ordinary tasks you are assigned and in moments when you might be doing something not apparently connected to your call Just the way you smile or the way you offer to help someone can build their faith And should you forget who you are just the way you speak and the way you behave can destroy faith Your call has eternal consequences for others and for you In the world to come thousands may call your name blessed even more than the people you serve here They will be the ancestors and the descendants of those who chose eternal life because of something you said or did or even what you were If someone rejects the Savior s invitation because you did not do all you could have done their sorrow will be yours You see there are no small callings to represent the Lord Your call carries grave responsibility But you need not fear because with your call come great promises One of those promises is the second thing you need to know It is that the Lord will guide you by revelation just as He called you You must ask in faith for revelation to know what you are to do With your call comes the promise that answers will come But that guidance will come only when the Lord is sure you will obey To know His will you must be committed to do it The words Thy will be done written in the heart are the window to revelation The answer comes by the Holy Spirit You will need that guidance often To have the Holy Ghost as your companion you must be worthy cleansed by the Atonement of Jesus Christ So your obedience to the commandments your desire to do His will and your asking in faith will determine how clearly the Master can guide you by answers to your prayers Often the answers will come as you study the scriptures They contain accounts of what the Lord did in His mortal ministry and the guidance He has given His servants They have doctrine in them which will apply in every time and every situation Pondering the scriptures will lead you to ask the right questions in prayer And just as surely as the heavens were opened to Joseph Smith after he pondered the scriptures in faith God will answer your prayers and He will lead you by the hand There is a third thing you need to know Just as God called you and will guide you He will magnify you You will need that magnification Your calling will surely bring opposition You are in the Master s service You are His representative Eternal lives depend on you He faced opposition and He said that facing opposition would be the lot of those He called The forces arrayed against you will try not only to frustrate your work but to bring you down The Apostle Paul described it this way For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world 1There will be times when you will feel overwhelmed One of the ways you will be attacked is with the feeling that you are inadequate Well you are inadequate to answer a call to represent God with only your own powers But you have access to more than your natural capacities and you do not work alone The Lord will magnify what you say and what you do in the eyes of the people you serve He will send the Holy Ghost to manifest to them that what you spoke was true What you say and do will carry hope and give direction to people far beyond your natural abilities and your own understanding That miracle has been a mark of the Lord s Church in every dispensation It is so much a part of your call that you may begin to take it for granted The day of your release will teach you a great lesson On the day I was released as a bishop one of the ward members came to my home afterwards and said I know you are no longer my bishop but could we talk just one more time You have always spoken words I needed and given me such good counsel The new bishop doesn t know me the way you do Could we just talk one more time Reluctantly I agreed The member sat down in a chair opposite mine It seemed to be just as it had been in the hundreds of times I had interviewed members of the ward as a judge in Israel The conversation began There came the moment when counsel was needed I waited for the ideas the words and the feelings to flow into my mind as they always had Nothing came In my heart and mind there was only silence After a few moments I said I m sorry I appreciate your kindness and your trust But I m afraid I can t help you When you are released from your calling you will learn what I learned then God magnifies those He calls even in what may seem to you a small or inconspicuous service You will have the gift of seeing your service magnified Give thanks while that gift is yours You will appreciate its worth more than you can imagine when it is gone The Lord will not only magnify the power of your efforts He will work with you Himself His voice to four missionaries called through the Prophet Joseph Smith to a difficult task gives courage to everyone He calls in His kingdom And I myself will go with them and be in their midst and I am their advocate with the Father and nothing shall prevail against them 2Because the Savior is a resurrected and glorified being He is not physically with every one of His servants at every moment But He is perfectly aware of them and their circumstance and able to intervene with His power That is why He can promise you Whoso receiveth you there I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 3There is yet another way the Lord will magnify you in your call to His service You will feel at some time perhaps at many times that you cannot do all you feel you must The heavy weight of your responsibilities will seem too great You will worry that you can t spend more time with your family You will wonder how you can find the time and the energy to meet your responsibilities beyond your family and your calling You may feel discouragement and even guilt after you have done all you could to meet all your obligations I have had such days and such nights Let me tell you what I have learned It is this If I only think of my own performance my sadness deepens But when I remember that the Lord promised that His power would go with me I begin to look for evidence of what He has done in the lives of the people I am to serve I pray to see with spiritual eyes the effects of His power Then invariably the faces of people flood back into my memory I remember the shine in the eyes of my child whose heart was softened the tears of happiness on the face of a girl on the back row of a Sunday School class I was teaching or a problem that was resolved before I had time to get to it I know then that I have done enough for the promise made by Joseph Smith to be fulfilled once again Let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power and then may we stand still with the utmost assurance to see the salvation of God and for his arm to be revealed 4You can have the utmost assurance that your power will be multiplied many times by the Lord All He asks is that you give your best effort and your whole heart Do it cheerfully and with the prayer of faith The Father and His Beloved Son will send the Holy Ghost as your companion to guide you Your efforts will be magnified in the lives of the people you serve And when you look back on what may now seem trying times of service and sacrifice the sacrifice will have become a blessing and you will know that you have seen the arm of God lifting those you served for Him and lifting you I know that God the Father lives He hears and answers our prayers Those we serve are His spirit children This is the true Church of Jesus Christ His is the only name through which our Father s children may be sanctified and gain eternal life The keys of the priesthood are exercised by the Lord s living prophet Gordon B Hinckley I testify that the Savior lives and leads His living Church I know that I am a witness for Him and of Him He sees and appreciates your faithful service in the work to which He called you In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Each year hundreds of thousands of the children of our Heavenly Father come into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints For most it requires a great change in their lives All of them have made a sacred covenant with great promises and with a solemn pledge to endure That covenant is so important that our Heavenly Father described the blessing and the challenge to the prophet Nephi And I heard a voice from the Father saying Yea the words of my Beloved are true and faithful He that endureth to the end the same shall be saved And now my beloved brethren I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end in following the example of the Son of the living God he cannot be saved 1The Savior warns that if we start along the path and go far enough and then fail and deny Him it would have been better if we had never begun 2I think of that each time I visit with new members of the Church I get that opportunity often across the world I see their trusting faces and often they tell me about some trial of their faith and then with urgency in their voices they whisper Please pray for me At those moments I feel again the weight of the charge to each of us from the Lord s living prophet It is to keep the promise we made in the waters of baptism to bear one another s burdens 3 It is to be a friend These words of President Hinckley energize me I hope I pray I plead with you every one of you to embrace every new member of the Church Make a friend of him or her Hold onto them 4President Hinckley can t be there as a friend for every new member But you can be there for at least one All it takes is to feel something of what they feel and something of what the Savior feels for them Try to feel the heart of a young man Nkosiyabo Eddie Lupahla in Africa writing about his friend Two and a half years prior to my joining the Church in 1999 my good friend Mbuti Yona looked me up We had been friends through grades 5 to 12 then were separated when we attended different schools Mbuti was baptized in April 1999 and four weeks later he visited me at home and introduced the gospel to me Regardless of the rumors about the Church I was impressed by the fellow Saints who gave me a warm welcome on my first visit It was this same Sunday that my friend introduced me to the missionaries Arrangements were made to be taught My friend was there for every discussion and he kept inviting me to the activities I really enjoyed being around people with the same values interests standards and goals It was during this same time period that I began attending institute of religion It all seemed very natural Thursday nights 5 30 missionary discussion followed by institute I learned a lot in institute and especially enjoyed our class about how to achieve a celestial marriage The first semester ended in May shortly after I began attending and I felt cheated But I was fortunate enough to catch the second semester class Teachings of the Living Prophets While in institute I bought myself the four standard works and I continued to learn and grow in the Church line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little I was baptized September 17 1999 by another friend I had made while attending institute I am thankful for the institute program It has not only shaped me but it has also helped me qualify to become a missionary which mission I started preparing for five months after my baptism I have been blessed with many opportunities to serve and to teach prior to my mission I am thankful for my friend I hope he realizes what he has done for me We have both served missions I to South Africa Durban he to South Africa Cape Town All it takes is a friend to bring such a mighty change in one s life 5Now there seems to be nothing miraculous in that story But there is a miracle of wisdom beyond human capacity Perhaps because Mbuti had walked the path himself or perhaps by revelation he knew what his friend would have to do to endure And so he knew how to lift and help He introduced his friend to the missionaries He saw that his friend was baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost He took his friend even before baptism to where he would study the scriptures and thus be nurtured by the good word of God Even before baptism he helped his friend discover this promise Wherefore I said unto you feast upon the words of Christ for behold the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do 6 The words must have told him to buy scriptures which he did At baptism Brother Lupahla received the gift of the Holy Ghost to serve as his constant companion as long as he invited it and lived worthy of it That assured him of another promise For behold again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way and receive the Holy Ghost it will show unto you all things what ye should do 7 The Holy Ghost must have told him to begin to prepare for a mission which he did We do not know which friends went with him to his sacrament meetings both before and after baptism but some must have greeted him warmly as they did on his first visit There he renewed his covenant to always remember the Savior to keep His commandments and to receive again the promise of the companionship of the Holy Ghost We don t know what part his friends had in his calls to serve and to speak But we can be sure that they thanked him and told him when they felt the Spirit in his service and in his teaching We can know something of his private life Remember that he wrote that he continued to learn He wrote that he grew in the Church line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little He said that he had been shaped by his experiences in the Church Educational System institute We know from the scriptures what caused those changes in him He had to be praying with faith in the Savior He was receiving testimony and directions through the Spirit And then he was not only doing what he was inspired to do but he was asking God to let the Atonement work in his life Nephi describing that miracle of change and what brings it said this And now my beloved brethren I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray but teacheth him that he must not pray But behold I say unto you that ye must pray always and not faint that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul 8The Holy Ghost is a comforter and a guide But it is also a cleansing agent That is why service in the kingdom is so crucial to enduring When we are called to serve we can pray for the Holy Ghost to be our companion with assurance it will come When we ask in faith a change can come in our natures both for the welfare of our souls and to strengthen us for the tests we all must face There are limits on what friends can do to help the ones who must endure It is the new members who must pray It is they who must rely on the strength they will receive in answers to their prayers They must choose for themselves in faith to be baptized trusting in their perfect friend the Savior They must choose in faith in Him to repent to be humble and contrite They must choose to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost The words of confirmation into the Church are an invitation Receive the Holy Ghost And that choice must be made not once but every day every hour every minute Even when the Holy Ghost comes and inspires them what they should do doing it or not is a choice Even when they read the scriptures regularly it takes a choice to feast upon the words of Christ And even the feast is not nourishing without a choice to do what the words of Christ tell them to do With faith and obedience practiced long enough the Holy Ghost becomes a constant companion our natures change and endurance becomes certain The member must make the choices but the true friend is vital There are important ways for us to share the new member s burden that it may be bearable We can love listen show and testify First we must love them That is what the Savior does We can do it with Him and for Him He showed us the way in His mortal ministry He taught by precept and example that we are to love His disciples This is my commandment That ye love one another as I have loved you Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you Henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you 9The Savior watches over the struggling member as a friend He laid down His life for all of us He loves us and will grant us if we are faithful the gift of feeling a part of His love for them I have at times been blessed by the Holy Ghost to sense the Savior s love for a struggling new member I know for myself that is possible Second we must listen to the new member with understanding and empathy That also will take spiritual gifts since our experience will rarely parallel theirs It will not be enough to say I understand how you feel unless we do But the Savior does He is prepared to help you be a friend who understands even those you have just met if you ask in faith Before He was born prophets knew what He would do to be able to help you be a friend for Him And he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities 10Third we must be an example for the new member We can feast upon the word of God We can ask for and live for the companionship of the Holy Ghost We can be obedient out of our faith in Jesus Christ And in time we can become an example of a disciple who is born again through the Atonement It may be gradual It may be hard for us to discern in ourselves But it will be real And it will give hope to the new member and to all those we befriend on the path to eternal life Fourth we must testify of the truth to the new member It must be sincere and it is best when it is simple It is most helpful when it is about the reality and mission of the Savior about our Heavenly Father s love and of the gifts and companionship of the Holy Ghost And it is essential to testify that the Father and the Son appeared to the young Joseph Smith and that the full gospel and the true Church have been restored by heavenly messengers The Holy Ghost will confirm those simple declarations as truth The new member will need that confirmation again and again even when we are not there to testify Should they choose to reject the companionship of the Holy Ghost he or she will not endure But that is true for all of us wherever we are and however faithful we have been All of us will be tested And all of us need true friends to love us to listen to us to show us the way and to testify of truth to us so that we may retain the companionship of the Holy Ghost You must be such a true friend I can still remember as if it were today friends who touched my life for good long ago They are gone but the memory of their love example faith and testimony still lifts me And your friendship to even one new member may in this life and in the next cause hundreds or even thousands of their ancestors and their descendants to call you blessed This is the true Church of Jesus Christ He lives He loves you and He loves those whom you must serve and who will become your true friends forever In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
The world seems to be in commotion There are wars and rumors of wars The economies of whole continents are faltering Crops are failing from lack of rain in places all over the earth And the people in peril have flooded heaven with prayers In public and in private they are petitioning God for help for comfort and for direction You have probably noticed as I have in recent days that prayers have not only become more numerous but more heartfelt I often am seated on the stand in a meeting near the person who has been asked to pray I have listened recently with wonder The words spoken are clearly inspired by God both eloquent and wise And the tone is that of a loving child seeking help not as we might from an earthly parent but from an all powerful Heavenly Father who knows our needs before we ask Such a turning to fervent prayer when the world seems out of joint is as old as mankind In times of tragedy and danger people turn to God in prayer Even the ancient King David would recognize what is happening You remember his words from the book of Psalms The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou Lord hast not forsaken them that seek thee 1The great increase in heartfelt prayer and the public acceptance of it has been remarkable to me and to others More than once in recent days someone has said to me with great intensity and with a sound of worry in the voice I hope that the change lasts That worry is justified Our own personal experience and God s record of His dealing with His children teaches us that Dependence on God can fade quickly when prayers are answered And when the trouble lessens so do the prayers The Book of Mormon repeats that sad story over and over again From the book of Helaman O how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he has delivered you 2 And later from the same book after God had answered prayers with gracious kindness the awful pattern is described again And thus we can behold how false and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men yea we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him Yea and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people yea in the increase of their fields their flocks and their herds and in gold and in silver and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art sparing their lives and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them yea and in fine doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people yea then is the time that they do harden their hearts and do forget the Lord their God and do trample under their feet the Holy One yea and this because of their ease and their exceedingly great prosperity And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions yea except he doth visit them with death and with terror and with famine and with all manner of pestilence they will not remember him 3And now from the next words of that same scripture we learn why it is we forget so easily the source of our blessings and cease to feel our need to pray with faith O how foolish and how vain and how evil and devilish and how quick to do iniquity and how slow to do good are the children of men yea how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world Yea how quick to be lifted up in pride yea how quick to boast and do all manner of that which is iniquity and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God and to give ear unto his counsels yea how slow to walk in wisdom s paths Behold they do not desire that the Lord their God who hath created them should rule and reign over them notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them they do set at naught his counsels and they will not that he should be their guide 4From those three short verses of scripture we see three causes for the sad drift away from humble prayer First while God implores us to pray the enemy of our souls belittles and then derides it The warning from 2 Nephi is true And now my beloved brethren I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray but teacheth him that he must not pray 5Second God is forgotten out of vanity A little prosperity and peace or even a turn slightly for the better can bring us feelings of self sufficiency We can feel quickly that we are in control of our lives that the change for the better is our own doing not that of a God who communicates to us through the still small voice of the Spirit Pride creates a noise within us which makes the quiet voice of the Spirit hard to hear And soon in our vanity we no longer even listen for it We can come quickly to think we don t need it The third cause is rooted deeply within us We are spirit children of a loving Heavenly Father who placed us in mortality to see if we would choose freely choose to keep His commandments and come unto His Beloved Son They do not compel us They cannot for that would interfere with the plan of happiness And so there is in us a God given desire to be responsible for our own choices That desire to make our own choices is part of the upward pull toward eternal life But it can if we see life only through our mortal eyes make dependence on God difficult or even impossible when we feel such a powerful desire to be independent This true doctrine can sound hard For the natural man is an enemy to God and has been from the fall of Adam and will be forever and ever unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord and becometh as a child submissive meek humble patient full of love willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him even as a child doth submit to his father 6Those who submit like a child do it because they know that the Father wants only the happiness of His children and that only He knows the way That is the testimony we must have to keep praying like a submissive child in the good times as well as the times of trouble With that faith we will be able to pray for what we want and appreciate whatever we get Only with that faith will we pray with the diligence God requires When God has commanded us to pray He has used words like pray unceasingly and pray always and mighty prayer Those commands do not require using many words In fact the Savior has told us that we need not multiply words when we pray The diligence in prayer which God requires does not take flowery speech nor long hours of solitude That is taught clearly in Alma in the Book of Mormon Yea and when you do not cry unto the Lord let your hearts be full drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare and also for the welfare of those who are around you 7Our hearts can only be drawn out to God when they are filled with love for Him and trust in His goodness Joseph Smith even as a boy gave us an example of how we can come to pray from a heart filled with the love of God and then pray unceasingly through a life filled with trials and blessings Joseph started for the grove to pray with faith that a loving God would answer his prayer and relieve his confusion He gained that assurance reading the word of God and receiving a witness that it was true He said that he read in James Let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him 8 His faith to ask of God in prayer came after pondering a scripture which assured him of God s loving nature He prayed as we must with faith in a loving God He prayed with the intent not only to listen but to obey He did not ask only to know the truth He was committed to act upon whatever God would communicate to him His written account makes clear that he prayed with real intent determined to comply with whatever answer he received He wrote Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart I reflected on it again and again knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God I did for how to act I did not know and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had I would never know for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible 9The Father and His Beloved Son appeared to him in answer to his prayer And he was told how to act as he had desired He obeyed like a child He was told to join none of the churches He did as he was told And because of his faithfulness in the days and months and years ahead his prayers were answered with a flood of light and truth The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the keys of the kingdom of God were restored to the earth His humble dependence on God led to the Restoration of the gospel with authority and sacred ordinances Because of that Restoration we have the chance to choose the most priceless independence to be free of the bondage of sin through the cleansing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ Joseph Smith s mission was unique yet his humble prayer can be a helpful model for us He began as we must with faith in a loving God who can and wants to communicate with us and help us That faith was rooted in impressions which came to him as he pondered the words of God s servants in the scriptures We can and must go often and carefully to the word of God If we become casual in our study of the scriptures we will become casual in our prayers We may not cease to pray but our prayers will become more repetitive more mechanical lacking real intent Our hearts cannot be drawn out to a God we do not know and the scriptures and the words of living prophets help us know Him As we know Him better we love Him more We must also serve Him to love Him Joseph Smith did that finally surrendering life itself in His service Joseph prayed with the intent to obey That obedience always includes service to others Service in God s work allows us to feel a part of what He feels and come to know Him For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart 10 As our love for Him increases so will our desire to approach the Father in prayer The words and the music of this conference will lead you to do what will strengthen you against the danger of a drift away from heartfelt prayer From what you hear you will feel promptings to go to the scriptures Follow the promptings You will be reminded in this conference of service you committed to give when you entered the waters of baptism Choose to obey If you ponder the scriptures and begin to do what you covenanted with God to do I can promise you that you will feel more love for God and more of His love for you And with that your prayers will come from the heart full of thanks and of pleading You will feel a greater dependence on God You will find the courage and the determination to act in His service without fear and with peace in your heart You will pray always And you will not forget Him no matter what the future brings I bear you my testimony that God the Father lives He loves us He hears our prayers and He answers with what is best for us As we come to know Him through His words and in His service we will love Him more I know that is true The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the true Church of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith The keys of the priesthood are only in this Church I know as surely as I live that President Gordon B Hinckley holds and exercises the keys on the earth Jesus Christ lives I know that and He leads His Church today He will teach you through His servants in this conference In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful for the honor of speaking in the name of the Lord to the shepherds of Israel That is who we are When we accepted the priesthood we took upon us the responsibility to do our part in watching over the Church None of us can escape accountability The president of the priesthood in all the earth bears the total responsibility Through the keys of the priesthood each quorum bears its part Even the newest deacon in the most distant place on earth has a part in the great responsibility to watch over the Church Listen to these words from the Doctrine and Covenants Therefore let every man stand in his own office and labor in his own calling and let not the head say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand And then the Savior includes even the deacons in His listing of assignments The deacons and teachers should be appointed to watch over the church to be standing ministers unto the church D C 84 109 111 I pray that I might explain our sacred trust so that even the newest deacon and the convert most recently ordained will see his opportunity In many places in the scriptures the Lord has described Himself and those He calls to the priesthood as shepherds A shepherd watches over sheep In the scriptural stories the sheep are in danger they need protection and nourishment The Savior warns us that we must watch the sheep as He does He gave His life for them They are His We cannot approach His standard if like a hired servant we watch only when it is convenient and only for a reward Here is His standard I am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep But he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep John 10 11 12 The members of the Church are the sheep They are His and we are called by Him to watch over them We are to do more than warn them against danger We are to feed them Once long ago the Lord commanded His prophet to rebuke the shepherds of Israel Here is the warning which is still in force in the words of the prophet Ezekiel And the word of the Lord came unto me saying Son of man prophesy against the shepherds of Israel and say unto them Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the flocks Ezek 34 1 2 The food those shepherds took for themselves letting the sheep starve could lead to salvation for the sheep One of the great shepherds in the Book of Mormon described both what that food is and how it can be provided And after they had been received unto baptism and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ and their names were taken that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God to keep them in the right way to keep them continually watchful unto prayer relying alone upon the merits of Christ who was the author and the finisher of their faith Moro 6 4 It is painful to imagine a shepherd feeding himself and letting the sheep go hungry Yet I have seen many shepherds who feed their flocks One was the president of a deacons quorum One of his quorum members lived near my home That neighbor boy had never attended a quorum meeting nor done anything with the members of his quorum His stepfather was not a member and his mother did not attend church The presidency of his deacons quorum met in council one Sunday morning Each week they were fed the good word of God by the fine adviser and teacher In their presidency meeting those 13 year old shepherds remembered the boy who never came They talked about how much he needed what they received The president assigned his counselor to go after that wandering sheep I knew the counselor and I knew he was shy and I knew the difficulty of the assignment so I watched with wonder through my front window as the counselor trudged by my house going up the road to the home of the boy who never came to church The shepherd had his hands in his pockets His eyes were on the ground He walked slowly the way you would if you weren t sure you wanted to get where you were headed In 20 minutes or so he came back down the road with the lost deacon walking by his side That scene was repeated for a few more Sundays Then the boy who had been lost and was found moved away Now that story seems unremarkable It was just three boys sitting in a room around a small table Then it was a boy walking up a road and coming back with another boy But years later I was in a stake conference a continent away from the room in which that presidency had met in council A gray haired man came up to me and said quietly My grandson lived in your ward years ago With tenderness he told me of that boy s life And then he asked if I could find that deacon who walked slowly up that road And he wondered if I could thank him and tell him that his grandson now grown to be a man still remembered He remembered because in those few weeks he had been for the first time in his life that he recognized watched over by the shepherds of Israel He had been warned by hearing eternal truth from people who cared about him He had been offered the bread of life And young shepherds had been true to their trust from the Lord It is not easy to learn to do that well and do it consistently The Savior showed us how and how to train others to do it He established His Church He had to leave His Church in the hands of inexperienced servants just as many of us are He knew they would face difficulties beyond their human powers to resolve What He did for them can be a guide for us When the Savior went to the Garden of Gethsemane to suffer bitter agonies before His betrayal and sufferings on the cross He could have gone alone But He took His priesthood servants with Him Here is the account from Matthew Then saith he unto them My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me Matt 26 38 emphasis added The Savior prayed to His Father for strength In the midst of His agony He returned to Peter to teach him what it requires for all who would watch with Him And he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter What could ye not watch with me one hour Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak Matt 26 40 41 There is a reassurance and a warning in that simple exchange of the Master with His shepherds He watches with us He who sees all things whose love is endless and who never sleeps He watches with us He knows what the sheep need at every moment By the power of the Holy Ghost He can tell us and send us to them And we can by the priesthood invite His power to bless them But His warning to Peter is to us as well The wolf who would kill the sheep will surely tear at the shepherd So we must watch over ourselves as well as others As a shepherd we will be tempted to go near the edges of sin But sin in any form offends the Holy Ghost You must not do anything or go anywhere that offends the Spirit You cannot afford that risk Should sin cause you to fail you would not only be responsible for your own sins but for the sorrow you might have prevented in the lives of others had you been worthy to hear and obey the whisperings of the Spirit The shepherd must be able to hear the voice of the Spirit and bring down the powers of heaven or he will fail The warning given to an ancient prophet is a warning to us as well So thou O son of man I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me When I say unto the wicked O wicked man thou shalt surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand Ezek 33 7 8 The penalty for failure is great But the Lord taught Peter how to build the foundation for success He repeated a simple message three times It was that love for the Lord would be in the heart of a true shepherd Here is the end of the account He saith unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time Lovest thou me And he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus saith unto him Feed my sheep John 21 17 It is love that must motivate the shepherds of Israel That may seem difficult at the start because we may not even know the Lord well But if we begin with even a little grain of faith in Him our service to the sheep will increase our love for Him and for them It comes from simple things that every shepherd must do We pray for the sheep every one for whom we are responsible When we ask Please tell me who needs me answers will come A face or a name will come into our minds Or we may have a chance meeting that we feel isn t chance In those moments we will feel the love of the Savior for them and for us As you watch over His sheep your love for Him will grow And that will increase your confidence and your courage Now you may be thinking It s not that easy for me I have so many people to watch over And I have so little time But where the Lord calls He prepares a way His way There are shepherds who believe that I ll tell you about one Two years ago a man was called as the president of his elders quorum He had been a member of the Church for less than 10 years He had just become worthy to be sealed to his wife and family in the temple His wife was an invalid He had three daughters The oldest was 13 and she cooked the meals and with the others cared for the house His scant earnings from manual labor supported not only those five people but a grandfather who lived with them in their small house When he was called to be president of his elders quorum it had 13 members That tiny quorum was responsible for another 101 men who either had no priesthood at all or who were deacons teachers or priests He was responsible to watch over the souls of 114 families with little hope that he could devote more than his Sundays and perhaps one night a week to his service with all he did to serve his own family The difficulty of what he faced drove him to his knees in prayer Then he stood up and went to work In his efforts to meet and know his sheep his prayers were answered in a way he had not expected He came to see beyond individuals He came to know that the Lord s purpose was for him to build families And even with his limited experience he knew that the way to build families would be to help them qualify to make and keep temple covenants He began to do what a good shepherd always does but he did it differently when he saw the temple as their destination First he prayed to know who were to be his counselors to go with him And then he prayed to know which families needed him and had been prepared He called on as many as he could Some were cold and did not accept his friendship But with those who did he followed a pattern As soon as he saw interest and trust he invited them to meet the bishop He had asked the bishop beforehand Please tell them what it takes to be worthy to go to the temple to claim its blessings for them and their families And then please testify to them as I have that it will be worth it A few then accepted the quorum president s invitation to a temple preparation class taught by stake leaders Not all completed the course and not all qualified for the temple But each family and each father was prayed for Most were invited at least once to a feast of the good word of God With every invitation came the president s testimony of the blessings of being a family sealed forever and the sadness of being separated Every invitation was issued with the love of the Savior During the president s service he has seen 12 of the men he taught ordained elders He has seen four of his elders ordained high priests Those numbers don t come close to measuring the miracle The families of those men will be blessed over generations Fathers and mothers are now sealed to each other and to their children They are praying over their children receiving the help of heaven and teaching the gospel with the love and inspiration the Lord gives to faithful parents That president and his counselors have become true shepherds They have watched over the flock with the Master and have come to love Him They are eyewitnesses to the truth of what the Savior taught an Apostle Thomas B Marsh It is true for all who watch with the Lord over His sheep Go your way whithersoever I will and it shall be given you by the Comforter what you shall do and whither you shall go Pray always lest you enter into temptation and lose your reward Be faithful unto the end and lo I am with you These words are not of man nor of men but of me even Jesus Christ your Redeemer by the will of the Father Amen D C 31 11 13 I testify that God the Father lives and answers our prayers I am a witness that the loving Savior watches over His sheep with His faithful shepherds In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Parents should teach their children to pray The child learns both from what the parents do and what they say The child who sees a mother or a father pass through the trials of life with fervent prayer to God and then hears a sincere testimony that God answered in kindness will remember what they saw and heard When their trials come they will be prepared In time when the child is away from home and family prayer can provide the shield of protection the parent will want so much for them to have Parting can be hard particularly when the parent and the child know that they may not see each other for a long time I had that experience with my father We parted on a street corner in New York City He had come there for his work I was there on my way to another place We both knew that I probably would never return to live with my parents under the same roof again It was a sunny day around noontime the streets crowded with cars and pedestrians On that particular corner there was a traffic light which stopped the cars and the people in all directions for a few minutes The light changed to red the cars stopped The crowd of pedestrians hurried off the curbs moving every way including diagonally across the intersection The time had come for parting and I started across the street I stopped almost in the center with people rushing by me I turned to look back Instead of moving off in the crowd my father was still standing on the corner looking at me To me he seemed lonely and perhaps a little sad I wanted to go back to him but I realized the light would change and so I turned and hurried on Years later I talked to him about that moment He told me that I had misread his face He said he was not sad he was concerned He had seen me look back as if I were a little boy uncertain and looking for assurance He told me in those later years that the thought in his mind had been Will he be all right Have I taught him enough Is he prepared for whatever may lie ahead There were more than thoughts in his mind I knew from having watched him that he had feelings in his heart He yearned for me to be protected to be safe I had heard and felt that yearning in his prayers and even more in the prayers of my mother for all the years I had lived with them I had learned from that and I remembered Prayer is a matter of the heart I had been taught far more than the rules of prayer I had learned from my parents and from the Savior s teachings that we must address our Heavenly Father in the reverent language of prayer Our Father in heaven Hallowed be Thy name Matt 6 9 I knew that we never profane His sacred name never Can you imagine how the prayers of a child are harmed by hearing a parent profane the name of God There will be terrible consequences for such an offense to the little ones I had learned that it was important to give thanks for blessings and to ask for forgiveness And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors Matt 6 12 I had been taught that we ask for what we need and pray for others to be blessed Give us this day our daily bread Matt 6 11 I knew that we must surrender our will Thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven Matt 6 10 I had been taught and found it true that we can be warned of danger and shown early what we have done which displeased God And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil Matt 6 13 I had learned that we must always pray in the name of Jesus Christ But something I had seen and heard had taught me those words were more than a formality There was a picture of the Savior on the bedroom wall where my mother was bedridden in the years before she died She had put it there because of something her cousin Samuel O Bennion had told her He had traveled with an Apostle who described seeing the Savior in a vision Elder Bennion gave her that print saying that it was the best portrayal he had ever seen of the Master s strength of character So she framed it and placed it on the wall where she could see it from her bed She knew the Savior and she loved Him I had learned from her that we do not close in the name of a stranger when we approach our Father in prayer I knew from what I had seen of her life that her heart was drawn to the Savior from years of determined and consistent effort to serve Him and to please Him I knew the scripture was true which warns For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart Mosiah 5 13 Years after my mother and father are gone the words in the name of Jesus Christ are not casual for me either when I say them or when I hear others say them We must serve Him to know the Master s heart But we also must pray that Heavenly Father will answer our prayers in our hearts as well as in our minds see Jer 31 33 Heb 8 10 Heb 10 16 and 2 Cor 3 3 President George Q Cannon described the blessing of people coming together having prayed for such answers He was speaking of going to a priesthood meeting yet many of you have come to this meeting with hearts prepared in the way he described in these words I should enter that assembly with my mind entirely free from all influence that would prevent the operation of the Spirit of God upon me I should go in a prayerful spirit asking God to write upon my heart His will not with my own will already prepared and determined to carry out my will regardless of everyone else s views If I were to go and all the rest were to go with this spirit then the Spirit of God would be felt in our midst and that which we would decide upon would be the mind and will of God because God would reveal it to us We would see light in the direction where we should go and we would behold darkness in the direction we should not go Deseret Semi Weekly News 30 Sept 1890 2 emphasis added Our goal when we teach our children to pray is for them to want God to write upon their hearts and be willing then to go and do what God asks of them It is possible for our children to have faith enough from what they see us do and what we teach that they can feel at least part of what the Savior felt as He prayed to have the strength to make His infinite sacrifice for us And he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt Matt 26 39 I have had prayers answered Those answers were most clear when what I wanted was silenced by an overpowering need to know what God wanted It is then that the answer from a loving Heavenly Father can be spoken to the mind by the still small voice and can be written on the heart Some parents are listening with this question But how can I soften the heart of my child now grown older and convinced he or she doesn t need God How can I soften a heart enough to allow God to write His will upon it Sometimes tragedy will soften a heart But for some even tragedy is not enough But there is one need even the hardened and proud person cannot believe they can meet for themselves They cannot lift the weight of sin from their own shoulders And even the most hardened may at times feel the prick of conscience and thus the need for forgiveness from God A loving father Alma taught that need to his son Corianton this way And now the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world to bring about the plan of mercy to appease the demands of justice that God might be a perfect just God and a merciful God also Alma 42 15 And then after bearing testimony of the Savior and His Atonement the father made this plea for a softened heart O my son I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins by denying the justice of God but do you let the justice of God and his mercy and his long suffering have full sway in your heart and let it bring you down to the dust in humility Alma 42 30 Alma knew what we can know that testifying of Jesus Christ and Him crucified had the greatest possibility of his son coming to sense his need for the help only God could give And prayers are answered to those whose hearts are softened by that overwhelming feeling of the need for cleansing When we teach those we love that we are spirit children temporarily away from a loving Heavenly Father we open the door of prayer to them We lived in His presence before we came here to be tested We knew His face and He knew ours Just as my earthly father watched me go away from him our Father in Heaven watched us go into mortality His Beloved Son Jehovah left those glorious courts to come down into the world to suffer what we would suffer and to pay the price of all the sins we would commit He provided for us the only way to go home again to our Heavenly Father and to Him If the Holy Ghost can tell us just that much about who we are we and our children might feel what Enos felt He prayed this way And my soul hungered and I kneeled down before my Maker and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul and all the day long did I cry unto him yea and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens And there came a voice unto me saying Enos thy sins are forgiven thee and thou shalt be blessed Enos 1 4 5 I can promise you that no joy will exceed what you would feel if a child of yours prays in the hour of need and receives such an answer You will someday be separated from them with a longing in your heart to be reunited A loving Heavenly Father knows that longing would last forever unless we are reunited as families with Him and His Beloved Son He put in place all His children will need to have that blessing To find it they must ask of God for themselves nothing doubting as the boy Joseph Smith did My dad was concerned that day in New York because he knew as my mother knew that the only real tragedy would be if we were apart forever That is why they taught me to pray They knew we could be together forever only with God s help and with His assurances As you will do they taught prayer best by example The afternoon my mother died we went to the family home from the hospital We sat quietly in the darkened living room for a while Dad excused himself and went to his bedroom He was gone for a few minutes When he walked back into the living room there was a smile on his face He said that he d been concerned for Mother During the time he had gathered her things from her hospital room and thanked the staff for being so kind to her he thought of her going into the spirit world just minutes after her death He was afraid she would be lonely if there was no one to meet her He had gone to his bedroom to ask his Heavenly Father to have someone greet Mildred his wife and my mother He said that he had been told in answer to his prayer that his mother had met his sweetheart I smiled at that too Grandma Eyring was not very tall I had a clear picture of her rushing through the crowd her short legs moving rapidly on her mission to meet my mother Dad surely didn t intend at that moment to teach me about prayer but he did I can t remember a sermon from my mother or my father about prayer They prayed when times were hard and when they were good And they reported in matter of fact ways how kind God was how powerful and how close The prayers I heard most were about what it would take for us to be together forever And the answers which will remain written on my heart seem most often to be the assurances that we were on the path When I saw in my mind my grandmother rushing to my mother I felt joy for them and a longing to bring my sweetheart and our children to such a reunion That longing is why we must teach our children to pray I testify that our Heavenly Father answers the pleadings of faithful parents to know how to teach their children to pray I testify that because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can have eternal life in families if we honor the covenants offered in this His true Church I so testify as His servant in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Hundreds of thousands of people in the last year were baptized and confirmed members of the Church Each was given the opportunity of a call to serve For them and for the Church that experience will shape the future Many of us remember the first time we gave a talk or conducted a meeting or knocked on the door of a home as an official visitor My heart beats a little faster just thinking about it The new members may have been baptized only days or weeks before their call to serve Some of them had never seen anyone perform the service that now was theirs Because we have no professional clergy the challenge of calls to serve came to more than the new members In the last year it is estimated that nearly two million Latter day Saints received either a new call to be a shepherd or were given some new sheep to watch over Just less than half of those called were youth some as young as 12 or 13 years of age More than 30 000 missionaries were called and set apart in that time Most of them were less than 20 years of age They went with only brief training and little experience Someone who knows organizations in the world might predict failure for a rapidly growing church depending on so many novice lay members Even those called may well have felt some apprehension And yet when they see through the eyes of faith the challenge as it really is confidence replaces fear because they turn to God My message is first to those newly called to serve in the Church then to those who called them and finally to those they will serve First to the newly called Confidence depends on your seeing the call for what it is Your call to serve is not from human beings It is a trust from God And the service is not simply to perform a task Whatever name it has every call is an opportunity and an obligation to watch over and strengthen the children of our Heavenly Father The Savior s work is to bring to pass their immortality and eternal life see Moses 1 39 He called us to serve others so that we could strengthen our own faith as well as theirs He knows that by serving Him we will come to know Him An inspired prophet saw service as the way we come to want what the Lord wants He wrote For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart Mosiah 5 13 Because you are called by Jesus Christ to His service you may go forward with great confidence First you may be assured that He knows you and your capacity to grow He has prepared you Calls will stretch you often at the start and always over their course but He will give you the Holy Ghost to be your companion The Holy Ghost will tell you what to do when your own abilities and efforts are not enough see John 14 26 The Holy Ghost will prompt you to bear testimony with conviction The Savior will let you feel the love He feels for those you serve The call is an invitation to become like Him see 3 Ne 27 27 You might well ask How will seeing my call that way make me more confident of success The answer is that seeing it in that lofty way will make it more likely that you will go for help to the only source that is never failing I saw a young man nearly overwhelmed by a new call not long ago The Lord had inspired His servant to call him to be the president of a stake The young man had never been a bishop He had never served in a stake presidency The stake had in it many men of greater maturity and experience He was humbled when he heard the call His wife through tears said to the servant of the Lord who called him Are you sure Her husband said quietly that he would serve His wife nodded her support tears streaming down her face As you might have done at such a time he wanted to talk with his father who was far away He called him that afternoon on the telephone His father has been a dairy farmer all his life He raised the boy into a man through milking cows and letting his son observe him stop to talk with neighbors to see how they were doing The next morning in his first talk as a stake president this is how he recounted the conversation with his father Many of you that know me know I am a man of few words I must have gotten that from my father As I called him yesterday to let him know that I was being called as a stake president his one response to me was Well you better do a lot of praying That was his counsel to me What better counsel could he give His father couldn t have done much better And you can see why The Lord is his only hope for success Most of the help will come through the ministrations of the Holy Ghost The Lord s servants cannot succeed without it We can only have the Holy Ghost as a companion if we plead for it and if we qualify for it And both require a lot of praying praying with real faith in our Heavenly Father and in His Beloved Son and in the Holy Ghost see D C 90 24 A of F 1 1 To have the companionship of the Holy Ghost we must be cleansed of sin see D C 50 29 That only comes through faith enough in Jesus Christ to repent and qualify for forgiveness see D C 3 20 And then we have to stay away from sin That takes prayer both frequent and fervent see 3 Ne 18 18 You better do a lot of praying is good counsel for all of the Lord s servants new or seasoned It is what His wise servants do They pray The disciples of Jesus Christ when He lived on the earth noticed that about Him He was the Son of God He was Jehovah And yet He prayed often enough to His Heavenly Father that His disciples realized that they must know how to pray to be His servants So they asked Him to teach them You remember the record And it came to pass that as Jesus was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples And he said unto them When ye pray say Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done as in heaven so in earth And forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil Luke 11 1 2 4 see also Matt 6 9 13 We seldom use those exact words as we pray But the words of that prayer are a perfect summary of what a servant of the Lord pleads for to qualify for the promise the Savior makes to all whom He calls And whoso receiveth you there I will be also for I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up D C 84 88 Think of that prayer as a standard of service The prayer begins with reverence for our Heavenly Father Then the Lord speaks of the kingdom and its coming The servant with a testimony that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ feels joy in its progress and a desire to give his or her all to build it up The Savior Himself exemplified the standard set by these next words of the prayer Thy will be done as in heaven so in earth Luke 11 2 That was His prayer in the extremity of offering the Atonement for all mankind and all the world see Matt 26 42 The faithful servant prays that even the apparently smallest task will be done as God would have it done It makes all the difference to work and to pray for His success more than for our own Then the Savior set for us this standard of personal purity And forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil Luke 11 4 The strengthening we are to give those we watch over comes from the Savior We and they must forgive to be forgiven by Him see Matt 6 14 We and they can only hope to remain clean with His protection and with the change in our hearts that His Atonement makes possible We need that change to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost Such a gift might seem too lofty and too distant for us and for those we serve But a prophet of the Lord named Samuel called and anointed a young man named Saul On that very day Samuel promised Saul And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man 1 Sam 10 6 That promise was fulfilled not after many years or months or even days Listen to the account in 1 Samuel the tenth chapter And it was so that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel God gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day And when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the Spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied among them 1 Sam 10 9 10 You may have confidence in the Lord s service The Savior will help you do what He has called you to do be it for a time as a worker in the Church or forever as a parent You may pray for help enough to do the work and know that it will come Now a word to those who have issued those calls in the Church When you did you conveyed the trust of the Lord But He placed a trust with you as well Just as those members were called to watch over and strengthen others you were placed under the same obligation to watch over and strengthen them If you issued the call and gave no training or did not watch to see that the training was enough you failed them and the Lord Even with that training the path will become difficult for them You know that and so you must watch and listen to see when they need strengthening You will give just enough help to strengthen their faith that the Lord is watching over them and over the people they serve and that they may turn with confidence to Him To do that well you must do a lot of praying yourself for guidance and for them Finally a word to those of us who are served by those who are newly called Our opportunity and our obligation is the same as theirs We are to watch and strengthen And each of us has almost endless chances to do it Every meeting you attend every class every activity will have someone doing something that to them is at the limit of their capacities or maybe a little beyond Most of us carry into those situations the attitudes we learn in the world where we may be quick to notice inferior service It is too easy to think In the Lord s true Church our standard of performance should be higher than that There is more than one way to help the Lord lift them to that standard One is to express or show our displeasure I ve been the beneficiary of another way the better way I ve sensed when I was not doing very well when I was speaking or teaching or leading in a meeting Most people can tell when they are failing I have been able to tell when I have been not doing well and I ve looked out and seen someone in the audience apparently not paying attention to me with eyes closed I ve learned not to be irritated And then they ve opened their eyes and smiled at me with a look of encouragement that was unmistakable It was a look that said as clearly as if they had spoken to me I know the Lord will help you and lift you up I m praying for you I ve been in settings where many people listening to me were doing that And I was lifted beyond what I knew were my abilities or at least what I had thought my abilities were You could serve that way when you see people struggling in their service It will take a lot of praying but you could watch and you could strengthen even when your only call in the Church at that moment is to be a follower of Jesus Christ and your only tools are to pray and smile and encourage There is a miracle appearing in the Church I see it as I travel back to nations after an absence of only a short time The members and the leaders are changed Just as Alma promised their souls have been enlarged and their understanding enlightened and their minds expanded see Alma 32 28 34 They have served each other in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ He has sent them the Holy Ghost as a companion in answer to fervent prayer Their watching over and testifying and loving and helping each other has let the Lord give a miracle of growth in the hearts and capacities of humble sons and daughters of God I know that God the Father lives He hears and answers our prayers I testify that His beloved Son Jesus Christ has called Gordon B Hinckley as His prophet and president I testify that through His authorized servants the Master calls us and that He sustains and transforms us in His service in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
All of us have faced deadlines Fear can grip us when we realize that there may not be enough time left to finish what we promised we would do The thought comes Why didn t I start earlier The Lord knew we would be tempted to procrastinate the most important preparation we could ever make in this life More than once He warned us about delay He taught the parable of the ten virgins five of whom did not fill their lamps for the coming of the bridegroom He also gave the parable of the servants who were faithless because they believed their Lord would delay His coming The results of delay were tragic For the five unprepared virgins it was this Afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us But he answered and said Verily I say unto you I know you not Matt 25 11 12 For the faithless servants who delayed their preparation it was this The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of And shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth Matt 24 50 51 The temptation to delay repentance comes not only at the end of the world as suggested by those scriptures That temptation seems to have been nearly constant since the beginning of time and goes on throughout our lives In youth we may have thought There will be time enough to worry about spiritual things just before my mission or before marriage Spiritual things are for older people Then in the early years of marriage the pressures of life of jobs of bills of finding a moment for rest and recreation seem to crowd us so closely that delay in meeting obligations to God and family again seems reasonable It is easy to think Perhaps there will be more time for that in the middle years But the compression of time does not ease in the years that follow There is so much to do and time seems to shrink The 55th birthday and the 65th and the 75th don t seem to be a decade apart With aging comes physical and emotional challenge We cannot seem to get as much done in an hour as we did in youth And it is harder to be patient with others and they seem more demanding It is tempting then to excuse ourselves yet again from rising to the standards required by our early covenants now so long neglected Not all of us fall into that trap of inaction But enough people do that we each have at least one person we love and often more a child a parent a friend someone for whom we feel responsibility for whom we ache with concern They have been taught the gospel They have made covenants And yet they go on in disobedience or neglect despite the emptiness we know that brings them The choice to repent or to remain a prisoner of sin is their own Yet knowing something of how the trap of inaction and resistance was built in their minds and hearts may help us hear more easily the answer to our fervent prayer Please Heavenly Father what can I do to help That temptation to delay comes from our enemy Lucifer He knows that we can never be truly happy unless we have hope in this life and then realization in the next of eternal life It is the greatest of all the gifts of God It is to live in families forever with our Heavenly Father and with Jesus Christ and to have eternal increase Satan wants us to be miserable as he is And he knows that we can only have that true happiness if we are washed clean through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ by deep and continuing repentance and the making and keeping of sacred covenants offered only through God s authorized servants The scriptures confirm the hazard Wherefore if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation then ye are found unclean before the judgment seat of God and no unclean thing can dwell with God wherefore ye must be cast off forever 1 Ne 10 21 And so Satan tempts with procrastination throughout our days of probation Any choice to delay repentance gives him the chance to steal happiness from one of the spirit children of our Heavenly Father We have all been tempted with that delay We know from our own experience that President Spencer W Kimball was right when he wrote One of the most serious human defects in all ages is procrastination and then he defined it an unwillingness to accept personal responsibility now The Teachings of Spencer W Kimball ed Edward L Kimball 1982 48 emphasis in original And so Satan works on both our desire to think we have no cause to repent and our desire to push anything unpleasant into the future He has tempted you and me and those we love with thoughts like this God is so loving surely He won t hold me personally responsible for mistakes which are simply the result of being human And then if that fails there is the thought that will almost surely come Well I may be responsible to repent but this is not a good time to start If I wait later will be better There are some truths which expose those lies intended to tempt us to procrastinate repentance Let s start with the deception which is so attractive that we have no need to repent The truth is that we all need repentance If we are capable of reason and past the age of eight we all need the cleansing that comes through applying the full effects of the Atonement of Jesus Christ When that is clear we cannot be tricked into delay by the subtle question Have I crossed the line of serious sin or can I put off even thinking about repentance The question that really matters is this How can I learn to sense even the beginning of sin and so repent early A second truth about our accountability is to know that we are not the helpless victims of our circumstances The world tries to tell us that the opposite is true imperfections in our parents or our faulty genetic inheritance are presented to us as absolving us of personal responsibility But difficult as circumstances may be they do not relieve us of accountability for our actions or our inactions Nephi was right God gives no commandments to the children of men save He prepares a way for them to obey However difficult our circumstances we can repent Similarly the world might be willing to excuse our bad behavior because those around us behave badly It is not true that the behavior of others removes our responsibility for our own God s standards for our behavior are unchanged whether or not others choose to rise to them That becomes especially difficult when others hurt us and we feel justified in our anger It is a lie that our anger justifies our impulse to hurt or ignore our antagonists We are to forgive to be forgiven To wait for them to repent before we forgive and repent is to allow them to choose for us a delay which could cost us happiness here and hereafter Finally we are personally accountable because the Lord has given us ample warning We receive the Spirit of Christ at birth to tell us right from wrong and to allow us to experience the connection between sin and unhappiness From the beginning of time He has sent prophets to speak against sin and to invite faith and repentance He has restored the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith Gordon B Hinckley is His living prophet holding all the keys of the priesthood which allow those who live now to repent and to choose to gain eternal life We are made accountable this day as the Holy Ghost confirms that these words are true Even the acceptance of personal responsibility may not overcome the temptation to believe that now is not the time to repent Now can seem so difficult and later appear so much easier The truth is that today is always a better day to repent than any tomorrow First sin has its debilitating effects on us The very faith we need to repent is weakened by delay The choice to continue in sin diminishes our faith and lessens our right to claim the Holy Ghost as our companion and comforter And second even should we be forgiven at some later time the Lord cannot restore the good effects our repentance today might have had on those we love and are to serve That is particularly poignant for the parents of young children In those tender years there are chances for shaping and lifting spirits which may never come again But even the grandfather who may have missed chances with his own children might by choosing to repent today do for grandchildren what he once could have done for their parents When responsibility is accepted and the urgency to repent is felt the question may come Where do I start Each life is unique But for all repentance will surely include passing through the portal of humble prayer Our Father in Heaven can allow us to feel fully the conviction of our sins He knows the depths of our remorse He can then direct what we must do to qualify for forgiveness For serious sin we will need to confess to a judge in Israel and accept his guidance Prayer alone will in that case not be enough But for all of us whatever the gravity of our sins prayer will open the door to repentance and forgiveness Without earnest prayer repentance and cleansing are not possible When the door is opened by prayer there is possibility for peace One of the questions we must ask of our Heavenly Father in private prayer is this What have I done today or not done which displeases Thee If I can only know I will repent with all my heart without delay That humble prayer will be answered And the answers will surely include the assurance that asking today was better than waiting to ask tomorrow I testify that the words of a servant of God spoken long ago are true And now my brethren I would that after ye have received so many witnesses seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance Yea I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer for behold now is the time and the day of your salvation and therefore if ye will repent and harden not your hearts immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you For behold this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God yea behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors And now as I said unto you before as ye have had so many witnesses therefore I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end for after this day of life which is given us to prepare for eternity behold if we do not improve our time while in this life then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed Ye cannot say when ye are brought to that awful crisis that I will repent that I will return to my God Nay ye cannot say this for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world Alma 34 30 34 There is another temptation to be resisted It is to yield to the despairing thought that it is too hard and too late to repent I knew a man once who could have thought that and given up When he was 12 he was ordained a deacon Some of his friends tempted him to begin to smoke He began to feel uncomfortable in church He left his little town not finishing high school to begin a life following construction jobs across the United States He was a heavy equipment operator He married They had children The marriage ended in a bitter divorce He lost his children He lost an eye in an accident He lived alone in boardinghouses He lost everything he owned except what he could carry in a trunk One night as he prepared to move yet again he decided to lighten the load of that trunk Beneath the junk of years he found a book He never knew how it got there It was the Book of Mormon He read it through and the Spirit told him it was true He knew then that all those years ago he had walked away from the true Church of Jesus Christ and from the happiness which could have been his Later he was my more than 70 year old district missionary companion I asked the people we were teaching as I testified of the power of the Savior s Atonement to look at him He had been washed clean and given a new heart and I knew they would see that in his face I told the people that what they saw was evidence that the Atonement of Jesus Christ could wash away all the corrosive effects of sin That was the only time he ever rebuked me He told me in the darkness outside the trailer where we had been teaching that I should have told the people that while God was able to give him a new heart He had not been able to give him back his wife and his children and what he might have done for them But he had not looked back in sorrow and regret for what might have been He moved forward lifted by faith to what yet might be One day he told me that in a dream the night before the sight in his blind eye was restored He realized that the dream was a glimpse of a future day walking among loving people in the light of a glorious resurrection Tears of joy ran down the deeply lined face of that towering raw boned man He spoke to me quietly with a radiant smile I don t remember what he said he saw but I remember that his face shone with happy anticipation as he described the view With the Lord s help and the miracle of that book in the bottom of a trunk it had not for him been too late nor the way too hard I testify that God the Father lives I know that And He loves us His Only Begotten Son lives Because He was resurrected we too will live again We will see then those we have loved and who have loved us We can through faith and obedience have family associations forever Those in our families who love us on both sides of the veil would say as we consider whether to humble our hearts and repent Please do not delay That is the Savior s invitation and His plea In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
There has been a war between light and darkness between good and evil since before the world was created The battle still rages and the casualties seem to be increasing All of us have family members we love who are being buffeted by the forces of the destroyer who would make all God s children miserable For many of us there have been sleepless nights We have tried to add every force for good we can to the powers swirling around the people who are at risk We have loved them We have set the best example we could We have pled in prayer for them A wise prophet long ago gave us counsel about another force which we may at times underestimate and thus use too little Alma was the leader of a people faced with destruction by ferocious enemies In the face of that danger he could not do everything so he had to choose He could have built fortifications or created armaments or trained armies But his only hope of victory was to get God s help and for that he knew the people must repent And so he chose to try one thing first And now as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just yea it had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword or anything else which had happened unto them therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God Alma 31 5 The word of God is the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ and by His prophets Alma knew that words of doctrine had great power They can open the minds of people to see spiritual things not visible to the natural eye And they can open the heart to feelings of the love of God and a love for truth The Savior drew on both those sources of power to open our eyes and open hearts in the 18th section of the Doctrine and Covenants as He taught His doctrine to those whom He wants to serve Him as missionaries As you listen think of that young man in your family now wavering in preparing himself for a mission Here is how the Master taught two of His servants and how you might teach His doctrine to the young man you love And now Oliver Cowdery I speak unto you and also unto David Whitmer by the way of commandment for behold I command all men everywhere to repent and I speak unto you even as unto Paul mine apostle for you are called even with that same calling with which he was called Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God D C 18 9 10 He began by saying how much He trusts them Then He draws their hearts to Him by saying how much His Father and He love every soul He next goes to the foundation of His doctrine He describes how much we have cause to love Him For behold the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh wherefore he suffered the pain of all men that all men might repent and come unto him And he hath risen again from the dead that he might bring all men unto him on conditions of repentance And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth D C 18 11 13 Having given the doctrine of His mission to open their hearts He gives them His command Wherefore you are called to cry repentance unto this people D C 18 14 Finally He opens their eyes to see beyond the veil He takes them and us to a future existence described in the great plan of salvation where we may yet be He tells us of wonderful associations worth giving our all to enjoy And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people and bring save it be one soul unto me how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father And now if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me D C 18 15 16 In those few passages He teaches doctrine to open our hearts to His love And He teaches doctrine to open our eyes to see spiritual realities invisible to any mind not illuminated by the Spirit of Truth The need to open eyes and hearts tells us how we must teach doctrine Doctrine gains its power as the Holy Ghost confirms that it is true We prepare those we teach as best we can to receive the quiet promptings of the still small voice That takes at least some faith in Jesus Christ It takes at least some humility some willingness to surrender to the Savior s will for us The person you would help may have little of either but you can urge that they desire to believe More than that you can take confidence from another of the powers of doctrine Truth can prepare its own way Simply hearing the words of doctrine can plant the seed of faith in the heart And even a tiny seed of faith in Jesus Christ invites the Spirit We have more control over our own preparation We feast on the word of God in the scriptures and study the words of the living prophets We fast and pray to invite the Spirit for ourselves and the person we would teach Because we need the Holy Ghost we must be cautious and careful not to go beyond teaching true doctrine The Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Truth His confirmation is invited by our avoiding speculation or personal interpretation That can be hard to do You love the person you are trying to influence He or she may have ignored the doctrine they have been taught It is tempting to try something new or sensational But we invite the Holy Ghost as our companion when we are careful to teach only true doctrine One of the surest ways to avoid even getting near false doctrine is to choose to be simple in our teaching Safety is gained by that simplicity and little is lost We know that because the Savior has told us to teach the most important doctrine to little children Listen to His command And again inasmuch as parents have children in Zion or in any of her stakes which are organized that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in Christ the Son of the living God and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands when eight years old the sin be upon the heads of the parents D C 68 25 We can teach even a child to understand the doctrine of Jesus Christ It is therefore possible with God s help to teach the saving doctrine simply We have the greatest opportunity with the young The best time to teach is early while children are still immune to the temptations of their mortal enemy and long before the words of truth may be harder for them to hear in the noise of their personal struggles A wise parent would never miss a chance to gather children together to learn of the doctrine of Jesus Christ Such moments are so rare in comparison with the efforts of the enemy For every hour the power of doctrine is introduced into a child s life there may be hundreds of hours of messages and images denying or ignoring the saving truths The question should not be whether we are too tired to prepare to teach doctrine or whether it wouldn t be better to draw a child closer by just having fun or whether the child isn t beginning to think that we preach too much The question must be With so little time and so few opportunities what words of doctrine from me will fortify them against the attacks on their faith which are sure to come The words you speak today may be the ones they remember And today will soon be gone The years pass we teach the doctrine the best we can and yet some still do not respond There is sorrow in that But there is hope in the scriptural record of families Think of Alma the Younger and Enos In their moments of crisis they remembered the words of their fathers words of the doctrine of Jesus Christ It saved them Your teaching of that sacred doctrine will be remembered Two doubts may creep into your mind You may wonder if you know the doctrine well enough to teach it And if you have already tried to teach it you may wonder why you can t see much of the good effects In my own family there is a story of a young woman who had the courage to start to teach doctrine when she was only a new convert with little education And the fact that the effects of her teaching haven t ended gives me patience to wait for the fruits of my own efforts Mary Bommeli was my great grandmother I never met her Her granddaughter heard her tell her story and wrote it down Mary was born in 1830 The missionaries taught her family in Switzerland when she was 24 She was still living at home weaving and selling cloth to help support her family on their small farm When the family heard the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ they knew it was true They were baptized Mary s brothers were called on missions going without purse or scrip The rest of the family sold their possessions to go to America to gather with the Saints There was not enough money for all to go Mary volunteered to stay behind because she felt she could earn enough from her weaving to support herself and save for her passage She found her way to Berlin and to the home of a woman who hired her to weave cloth for the family s clothing She lived in a servant s room and set up her loom in the living area of the home It was against the law then to teach the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in Berlin But Mary could not keep the good news to herself The woman of the house and her friends would gather around the loom to hear the Swiss girl teach She talked about the appearance of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to Joseph Smith of the visitation of angels and of the Book of Mormon When she came to the accounts of Alma she taught the doctrine of the Resurrection That caused some problems with her weaving In those days many children died very young The women around the loom had lost children in death some of them several children When Mary taught the truth that little children were heirs of the celestial kingdom and that those women might again be with them and with the Savior and our Heavenly Father tears rolled down the faces of the women Mary cried too All those tears falling got the cloth wet that Mary had woven Mary s teaching created a more serious problem Even though Mary begged the women not to talk about what she told them they did They shared the joyous doctrine with their friends So one night there was a knock at the door It was the police They took Mary off to jail On the way she asked the policeman for the name of the judge she was to appear before the next morning She asked if he had a family She asked if he was a good father and a good husband The policeman smiled as he described the judge as a man of the world At the jail Mary asked for a pencil and some paper She wrote a letter to the judge She wrote about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the Book of Mormon about the spirit world and about how long the judge would have to think and to consider his life before facing the final judgment She wrote that she knew he had much to repent of which would break his family s heart and bring him great sorrow She wrote through the night In the morning she asked the policeman to take her letter to the judge He did Later the policeman was summoned by the judge to his office The letter Mary had written was irrefutable evidence that she was teaching the gospel and so breaking the law Nevertheless it wasn t long until the policeman came back to Mary s cell He told her that all charges were dismissed and that she was free to go on the conditions she had stated in her letter Her teaching the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ had opened eyes and hearts enough to get her cast into jail And her declaring the doctrine of repentance to the judge got her cast out of jail see Theresa Snow Hill Life and Times of Henry Eyring and Mary Bommeli 1997 15 22 The teaching of Mary Bommeli touched more than those women around the loom and the judge My father her grandson talked to me during the nights as he approached death He spoke of joyous reunions that were coming soon in the spirit world I could almost see the bright sunlight and the smiles in that place of paradise as he talked about it with such assurance At one point I asked him if he had some repenting to do He smiled He chuckled softly as he said No Hal I ve been repenting as I went along The doctrine of paradise that Mary Bommeli taught those women was real to her grandson And even the doctrine Mary taught the judge had shaped my father s life for good That will not be the end of Mary Bommeli s teaching The record of her words will send true doctrine to generations of her family yet unborn Because she believed that even a new convert knew enough doctrine to teach it the minds and hearts of her descendants will be opened and they will be strengthened in the battle Your descendants will teach doctrine to each other because you taught it Doctrine can more than open minds to spiritual things and hearts to the love of God When that doctrine brings joy and peace it also has the power to open mouths Like those women in Berlin your descendants will not be able to keep the good news to themselves I am grateful to live in a time when we and our families have the fulness of the gospel restored I am grateful for the Savior s mission of love for us and for the words of life which He has given us I pray that we may share those words with those we love I testify that God our Father lives and loves all His children Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten Son in the flesh and our Savior He is risen We can be washed clean through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ The keys of the priesthood are restored President Gordon B Hinckley holds those keys I know that is true In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Because the Lord is kind He calls servants to warn people of danger That call to warn is made harder and more important by the fact that the warnings of most worth are about dangers that people don t yet think are real Think of Jonah He fled at first from the call from the Lord to warn the people of Nineveh who were blinded to the danger by sin He knew that wicked people through the ages have rejected prophets and sometimes killed them Yet when Jonah went forward with faith the Lord blessed him with safety and success We can also learn from our experiences as parents and as children Those of us who have been parents have felt the anxiety of sensing danger our children cannot yet see Few prayers are so fervent as those of a parent asking to know how to touch a child to move away from danger Most of us have felt the blessing of hearing and heeding the warning voice of a parent I can still remember my mother speaking softly to me one Saturday afternoon when as a little boy I asked her for permission to do something I thought was perfectly reasonable and which she knew was dangerous I still am amazed at the power she was granted I believe from the Lord to turn me around with so few words As I remember them they were Oh I suppose you could do that But the choice is yours The only warning was in the emphasis she put on the words could and choice Yet that was enough for me Her power to warn with so few words sprang from three things I knew about her First I knew she loved me Second I knew she had already done what she wanted me to do and been blessed by it And third she had conveyed to me her sure testimony that the choice I had to make was so important that the Lord would tell me what to do if I asked Him Love example and testimony those were keys that day and they have been whenever I have been blessed to hear and then heed the warning of a servant of the Lord Our ability to touch others with our warning voice matters to all who are covenant disciples of Jesus Christ Here is the charge given to each of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Behold I sent you out to testify and warn the people and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor D C 88 81 That command and warning of danger was given to those called as missionaries at the start of the Restoration But the duty to warn our neighbor falls on all of us who have accepted the covenant of baptism We are to talk with nonmember friends and relatives about the gospel Our purpose is to invite them to be taught by the full time missionaries who are called and set apart to teach When a person has chosen to accept our invitation to be taught a referral of great promise has been created one far more likely to enter the waters of baptism and then to remain faithful As a member of the Church you can expect that the full time or the stake missionaries will ask for the opportunity to visit with you in your home They will help you make a list of people with whom you could share the gospel They may suggest you think of relatives neighbors and acquaintances They may ask you to set a date by which you will try to have the person or family prepared to be taught perhaps even ready to invite the missionaries I ve had that experience Because we in our family accepted that invitation from the missionaries I was blessed to perform the baptism of a widow in her 80s taught by sister missionaries When I placed my hands on her head to confirm her a member of the Church I felt impressed to say that her choice to be baptized would bless generations of her family after and before her She s dead now but in a few weeks I will be in the temple with her son as he is sealed to her You may have had such experiences with people you have invited to be taught and so you know that few moments in life are sweeter The Lord s words are true for the missionaries and for all of us And now if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me D C 18 16 The missionaries will help and encourage us but whether such moments at the baptismal font and in the temple come more often will depend largely on how we see our charge and what we choose to do about it The Lord would not use the word warn if there is no danger Yet not many people we know sense it They have learned to ignore the increasing evidence that society is unraveling and that their lives and family lack the peace they once thought was possible That willingness to ignore the signs of danger can make it easy for you to think Why should I speak to anyone about the gospel who seems content What danger is there to them or to me if I do or say nothing Well the danger may be hard to see but it is real both for them and for us For instance at some moment in the world to come everyone you will ever meet will know what you know now They will know that the only way to live forever in association with our families and in the presence of our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ was to choose to enter into the gate by baptism at the hands of those with authority from God They will know that the only way families can be together forever is to accept and keep sacred covenants offered in the temples of God on this earth And they will know that you knew And they will remember whether you offered them what someone had offered you It s easy to say The time isn t right But there is danger in procrastination Years ago I worked for a man in California He hired me he was kind to me he seemed to regard me highly I may have been the only Latter day Saint he ever knew well I don t know all the reasons I found to wait for a better moment to talk with him about the gospel I just remember my feeling of sorrow when I learned after he had retired and I lived far away that he and his wife had been killed in a late night drive to their home in Carmel California He loved his wife He loved his children He had loved his parents He loved his grandchildren and he will love their children and will want to be with them forever Now I don t know how the crowds will be handled in the world to come But I suppose that I will meet him that he will look into my eyes and that I will see in them the question Hal you knew Why didn t you tell me When I think of him and when I think of that widow I baptized and her family who will now be sealed to her and to each other I want to do better I want to increase my power to invite people to be taught With that desire and with faith that God will help us we will do better It isn t hard to see how Love always comes first A single act of kindness will seldom be enough The Lord described the love we must feel and that those we invite must recognize in us with words like these Charity suffereth long and it beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things 1 Cor 13 4 7 I ve seen what suffereth long and endureth all things mean A family moved into a house near us The home was new so I was part of the crew of Latter day Saints who spent a number of nights putting in landscaping I remember the last night standing next to the husband of the family as we finished He surveyed our work and said to us standing nearby This is the third yard you Mormons have put in for us and I think this is the best And then he quietly but firmly told me of the great satisfaction he got from membership in his own church a conversation we had often in the years he lived there In all that time the acts of kindness extended to him and his family never ceased because the neighbors really came to love them One evening I came home to see a truck in his driveway I had been told they were moving to another state I approached to see if I could help I didn t recognize the man I saw loading household things into the truck He said quietly as I drew near Hello Brother Eyring I hadn t recognized him because he was the son now grown older who had lived there married and moved away And because of the love of many for him he was now a baptized member of the Church I don t know the end of that story because it will have no end But I know that it begins with love Second we will need to be better examples of what we invite others to do In a darkening world this command of the Savior will become more important Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven Matt 5 16 Most of us are modest enough to think that our small candle of example might be too dim to be noticed But you and your family are watched more than you may realize I had the chance in the spring of this year to attend and speak at meetings with nearly 300 ministers and leaders of other churches I visited alone with as many as I could I asked them why they had been so attentive to my message which was to recount the origins of the Church to tell of the young Joseph Smith s First Vision and of living prophets In every case they gave essentially the same answer They told a story of a person or a family a story of knowing some of you One repeated often was of a neighbor family Latter day Saints They were the finest family I have ever known Often they spoke of some community effort or public response to a disaster where members of the Church worked in a way which to them seemed remarkable The people I met at those meetings could not yet recognize the truth in the doctrine but they had already seen its fruit in your lives and so they were ready to listen They were ready to listen to the truths of the Restoration that families can be sealed forever and that the gospel can change our very natures They were ready because of your examples The third thing we must do better is to invite with testimony Love and example will open the way But we still have to open our mouths and bear testimony We are helped by a simple fact Truth and choice are inseparably connected For everyone there are some choices we must make to qualify for a testimony of spiritual truths And for everyone once we know a spiritual truth we must choose whether we will conform our lives to it That means there are some things we must do before we invite our friends to make choices And when we bear testimony of truth to them we must convey to them the choices which once they know that truth they must make There are two important examples inviting someone to read the Book of Mormon and inviting someone to agree to be taught by the missionaries For us to know that the Book of Mormon is true we must read it and make the choice found in Moroni pray to know if it is true When we have done that we can testify from personal experience to our friends that they can make that choice and know the same truth When they know the Book of Mormon is the word of God they will face another choice whether to accept your invitation to be taught by the missionaries To make that invitation with testimony you will need to know that the missionaries are called as servants of God You can gain that testimony by choosing to invite the missionaries into your home to teach your family or friends Missionaries will welcome the opportunity When you sit with them as they teach as I have you will know they are inspired with power beyond their years and their education Then when you invite others to choose to be taught by the missionaries you will be able to bear testimony that they will teach the truth and that they offer the choices which lead to happiness Perhaps some of us may find it hard to believe that we love enough or that our lives are good enough or that our power to testify is sufficient for our invitations to our neighbors to be accepted But the Lord knew we might feel that way Listen to His encouraging words which He directed to be placed at the first of the Doctrine and Covenants when He gave us our charge And the voice of warning shall be unto all people by the mouths of my disciples whom I have chosen in these last days D C 1 4 And then listen to His description of the qualifications of those disciples of us The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones D C 1 19 And then later That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world D C 1 23 And then again And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong and blessed from on high D C 1 28 That assurance was given to the first missionaries in the Church and to missionaries today But it is given to all of us as well We must have the faith that we can love enough and that the gospel has touched our lives enough that our invitation to choose can be heard as coming from the Master whose invitation it is His is the perfect example for what we are to do You have felt His love and His caring even when you did not respond as those you approach with the gospel may not respond Time after time He has invited you to be taught by His servants You may not have recognized that in the visits of home teachers and visiting teachers or in a bishop s phone call but those were His invitations to be helped and taught And the Lord has always made consequences clear and then allowed us to choose for ourselves His servant Lehi taught his sons what has always been true for all of us And now my sons I would that ye should look to the great Mediator and hearken unto his great commandments and be faithful unto his words and choose eternal life according to the will of his Holy Spirit 2 Ne 2 28 And then from Jacob this encouragement to meet your obligation to testify as you must that the choice to be taught by the missionaries is to enter the way toward eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God Therefore cheer up your hearts and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life 2 Ne 10 23 I testify that only accepting and living the restored gospel of Jesus Christ brings the peace the Lord promised in this life and the hope of eternal life in the world to come I testify that we have been given the privilege and the obligation to offer the truth and the choices which lead to those blessings to our Heavenly Father s children who are our brothers and our sisters Jesus is the Christ He lives and this is His work In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Savior of the world Jesus Christ said of those who would be part of His Church Be one and if ye are not one ye are not mine D C 38 27 And at the creation of man and woman unity for them in marriage was not given as hope it was a command Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh Gen 2 24 Our Heavenly Father wants our hearts to be knit together That union in love is not simply an ideal It is a necessity The requirement that we be one is not for this life alone It is to be without end The first marriage was performed by God in the garden when Adam and Eve were immortal He placed in men and women from the beginning a desire to be joined together as man and wife forever to dwell in families in a perfect righteous union He placed in His children a desire to live at peace with all those around them But with the Fall it became clear that living in unity would not be easy Tragedy struck early Cain slew Abel his brother The children of Adam and Eve had become subject to the temptations of Satan With skill hatred and cunning Satan pursues his goal It is the opposite of the purpose of our Heavenly Father and the Savior They would give us perfect union and eternal happiness Satan their enemy and ours has known the plan of salvation from before the Creation He knows that only in eternal life can those sacred joyful associations of families endure Satan would tear us from loved ones and make us miserable And it is he who plants the seeds of discord in human hearts in the hope that we might be divided and separate All of us have felt something of both union and separation Sometimes in families and perhaps in other settings we have glimpsed life when one person put the interests of another above his or her own in love and with sacrifice And all of us know something of the sadness and loneliness of being separate and alone We don t need to be told which we should choose We know But we need hope that we can experience unity in this life and qualify to have it forever in the world to come And we need to know how that great blessing will come so that we can know what we must do The Savior of the world spoke of that unity and how we will have our natures changed to make it possible He taught it clearly in the prayer He gave in His last meeting with His Apostles before His death That supernally beautiful prayer is recorded in the book of John He was about to face the terrible sacrifice for all of us that would make eternal life possible He was about to leave the Apostles whom He had ordained whom He loved and with whom He would leave the keys to lead His Church And so He prayed to His Father the perfect Son to the perfect Parent We see in His words the way families will be made one as will all the children of our Heavenly Father who follow the Savior and His servants As thou hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth Neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word That they all may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me John 17 18 21 In those few words He made clear how the gospel of Jesus Christ can allow hearts to be made one Those who would believe the truth He taught could accept the ordinances and the covenants offered by His authorized servants Then through obedience to those ordinances and covenants their natures would be changed The Savior s Atonement in that way makes it possible for us to be sanctified We can then live in unity as we must to have peace in this life and to dwell with the Father and His Son in eternity The ministry of the apostles and prophets in that day as it is today was to bring the children of Adam and Eve to a unity of the faith in Jesus Christ The ultimate purpose of what they taught and of what we teach is to unite families husbands wives children grandchildren ancestors and finally all of the family of Adam and Eve who will choose it You remember the Savior prayed For their sakes speaking of the Apostles I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth John 17 19 The Holy Ghost is a sanctifier We can have it as our companion because the Lord restored the Melchizedek Priesthood through the Prophet Joseph Smith The keys of that priesthood are on the earth today By its power we can make covenants which allow us to have the Holy Ghost constantly Where people have that Spirit with them we may expect harmony The Spirit puts the testimony of truth in our hearts which unifies those who share that testimony The Spirit of God never generates contention see 3 Ne 11 29 It never generates the feelings of distinctions between people which lead to strife see Joseph F Smith Gospel Doctrine 13th ed 1963 131 It leads to personal peace and a feeling of union with others It unifies souls A unified family a unified Church and a world at peace depend on unified souls Even a child can understand what to do to have the Holy Ghost as a companion The sacramental prayer tells us We hear it every week as we attend our sacrament meetings In those sacred moments we renew the covenants we made at baptism And the Lord reminds us of the promise we received as we were confirmed members of the Church the promise that we might receive the Holy Ghost Here are the words of the sacramental prayer They are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them that they may always have his Spirit to be with them D C 20 77 We can have His Spirit by keeping that covenant First we promise to take His name upon us That means we must see ourselves as His We will put Him first in our lives We will want what He wants rather than what we want or what the world teaches us to want As long as we love the things of the world first there will be no peace in us Holding an ideal for a family or a nation of comfort through material goods will at last divide them see Harold B Lee Stand Ye in Holy Places 1974 97 The ideal of doing for each other what the Lord would have us do which follows naturally from taking His name upon us can take us to a spiritual level which is a touch of heaven on earth Second we promise always to remember Him We do that every time we pray in His name Especially when we ask for His forgiveness as we must do often we remember Him At that moment we remember His sacrifice that makes repentance and forgiveness possible When we plead we remember Him as our advocate with the Father When the feelings of forgiveness and peace come we remember His patience and His endless love That remembering fills our hearts with love We also keep our promise to remember Him when as families we pray together and when we read the scriptures At family prayer around a breakfast table one child may pray for another to be blessed that things will go well that day in a test or in some performance When the blessings come the child blessed will remember the love of the morning and the kindness of the Advocate in whose name the prayer was offered Hearts will be bound in love We keep our covenant to remember Him every time we gather our families to read the scriptures They testify of the Lord Jesus Christ for that is the message and always has been of prophets Even if children do not remember the words they will remember the true Author who is Jesus Christ Third we promise as we take the sacrament to keep His commandments all of them President J Reuben Clark Jr as he pled as he did many times for unity in a general conference talk warned us against being selective in what we will obey He put it this way The Lord has given us nothing that is useless or unnecessary He has filled the Scriptures with the things which we should do in order that we may gain salvation President Clark went on When we partake of the Sacrament we covenant to obey and keep his commandments There are no exceptions There are no distinctions no differences in Conference Report Apr 1955 10 11 President Clark taught that just as we repent of all sin not just a single sin we pledge to keep all the commandments Hard as that sounds it is uncomplicated We simply submit to the authority of the Savior and promise to be obedient to whatever He commands see Mosiah 3 19 It is our surrender to the authority of Jesus Christ which will allow us to be bound as families as a Church and as the children of our Heavenly Father The Lord conveys that authority through His prophet to humble servants That faith turns our call as a home teacher or a visiting teacher into an errand from the Lord We go for Him at His command An ordinary man and a teenage junior companion go into homes expecting that the powers of heaven will help them assure that families are united and that there is no hardness lying backbiting nor evil speaking That faith that the Lord calls servants will help us ignore their limitations when they reprove us as they will We will see their good intent more clearly than their human limitations We will be less likely to feel offense and more likely to feel gratitude to the Master who called them There are some commandments which when broken destroy unity Some have to do with what we say and some with how we react to what others say We must speak no ill of anyone We must see the good in each other and speak well of each other whenever we can see David O McKay in Conference Report Oct 1967 4 11 At the same time we must stand against those who speak contemptuously of sacred things because the certain effect of that offense is to offend the Spirit and so create contention and confusion President Spencer W Kimball showed the way to stand without being contentious as he lay on a hospital gurney and asked an attendant who in a moment of frustration took the name of the Lord in vain Please Please That is my Lord whose names you revile There was a deathly silence then a subdued voice whispered I am sorry The Teachings of Spencer W Kimball ed Edward L Kimball 1982 198 An inspired loving rebuke can be an invitation to unity Failure to give it when moved upon by the Holy Ghost will lead to discord If we are to have unity there are commandments we must keep concerning how we feel We must forgive and bear no malice toward those who offend us The Savior set the example from the cross Father forgive them for they know not what they do Luke 23 34 We do not know the hearts of those who offend us Nor do we know all the sources of our own anger and hurt The Apostle Paul was telling us how to love in a world of imperfect people including ourselves when he said Charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil 1 Cor 13 4 5 And then he gave solemn warning against reacting to the fault of others and forgetting our own when he wrote For now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known 1 Cor 13 12 The sacramental prayer can remind us every week of how the gift of unity will come through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ When we keep our covenants to take His name upon us to remember Him always and to keep all His commandments we will receive the companionship of His Spirit That will soften our hearts and unite us But there are two warnings which must come with that promise First the Holy Ghost remains with us only if we stay clean and free from the love of the things of the world A choice to be unclean will repel the Holy Ghost The Spirit only dwells with those who choose the Lord over the world Be ye clean 3 Ne 20 41 D C 38 42 and love God with all your heart might mind and strength D C 59 5 are not suggestions but commandments And they are necessary to the companionship of the Spirit without which we cannot be one The other warning is to beware of pride A unity which comes to a family or to a people softened by the Spirit will bring great power With that power will come recognition from the world Whether that recognition brings praise or envy it could lead us to pride That would offend the Spirit There is a protection against pride that sure source of disunity It is to see the bounties which God pours upon us not only as a mark of His favor but an opportunity to join with those around us in greater service A man and his wife learn to be one by using their similarities to understand each other and their differences to complement each other in serving one another and those around them In the same way we can unite with those who do not accept our doctrine but share our desire to bless the children of our Heavenly Father We can become peacemakers worthy to be called blessed and the children of God see Matt 5 9 God our Father lives His beloved Son Jesus Christ is the head of this Church and He offers to all who will accept it the standard of peace I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Savior taught Peter and His other Apostles and disciples why and how they were to nourish others You remember that in the Bible account He fed them before He taught them He had been crucified and then resurrected His servants had gone to Galilee They had fished through the night catching nothing When they drew near to shore in the dawn they did not at first recognize Him He called out to them telling them where to cast their nets and when they did the nets were filled They rushed to greet Him on the shore They found a fire of coals with fish cooking and bread I have often wondered as you may have done who laid the fire who caught the fish and who cooked the meal but it was the Master who prepared His disciples to be fed more than fish and bread He let them eat first And then He taught them of spiritual feeding And He gave a commandment to them which still stands for each of us So when they had dined Jesus saith to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these He saith unto him Yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee He saith unto him Feed my lambs John 21 15 The Saints of God have always been under covenant to nourish each other spiritually especially those tender in the gospel We are blessed to live in a time when a great increase in that capacity to nourish new members of the Church must and therefore will be poured out upon the faithful Saints That power has been given before among the Lord s people This is the description of how the Lord s people did it once in a time recounted in the Book of Mormon In a scripture that we ve heard today you remember that they were numbered that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God to keep them in the right way to keep them continually watchful unto prayer relying alone upon the merits of Christ who was the author and the finisher of their faith Moro 6 4 All of us have tried at some time to nourish another person s faith Most of us have felt the concern of others for our own faith and with it we have felt their love More than a few of us have had a child look up to us and say Would you like to go to church with me or Would you pray with me And we have had our disappointments Someone we love may not have accepted our attempts to nourish their faith We know from painful experience that God respects the choice of His children not to be nourished Yet this is a time to feel renewed optimism and hope that our power to nourish will be increased The Lord through His living prophet has told us that He will preserve the bounteous harvest of new converts entering the waters of baptism across the earth And the Lord will do it through us So we can have confidence that by doing simple things things that even a child can do we will be granted soon greater power to nourish tender faith The place to start is with our own hearts What we want with all our hearts will determine in large degree whether we can claim our right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost without which there can be no spiritual nourishing We can begin today to try to see those we are to nourish as our Heavenly Father sees them and so feel some of what He feels for them Those new members of the Church are His children He has known them and they have known Him in the world before this one His purpose and that of His Son the Lord Jesus Christ is to have them return to Him and to give them eternal life if only they will choose it He has led and sustained His missionaries by the Holy Spirit to find and teach and baptize them He allowed His Son to pay the price of their sins Our Father and the Savior see those converts as tender lambs purchased with a price we cannot fathom A mortal parent may appreciate in some small way the feelings of a loving Heavenly Father When our children come to the age when they must leave our direct care we feel anxiety for their safety and concern that those who are to help them will not fail them We can feel at least some of the Father s and the Savior s love for the new members of the Church and the trust they place in us to nourish Those feelings in our hearts for the new members will go far to qualify us for the help of the Spirit and thus overcome the fears which may deter us from our sacred responsibility It is wise to fear that our own skills are inadequate to meet the charge we have to nourish the faith of others Our own abilities however great will not be enough But that realistic view of our limitations creates a humility which can lead to dependence on the Spirit and thus to power Brigham Young told us to have courage despite our weaknesses He did it in this language that seems so much like him In addressing a congregation though the speaker be unable to say more than half a dozen sentences and those awkwardly constructed if his heart is pure before God those few broken sentences are of more value than the greatest eloquence without the Spirit of the Lord and of more real worth in the sight of God angels and all good men In praying though a person s words be few and awkwardly expressed if the heart is pure before God that prayer will avail more than the eloquence of a Cicero What does the Lord the Father of us all care about our mode of expression The simple honest heart is of more avail with the Lord than all the pomp pride splendor and eloquence produced by men When he looks upon a heart full of sincerity integrity and child like simplicity he sees a principle that will endure forever That is the spirit of my own kingdom the spirit I have given to my children Discourses of Brigham Young sel John A Widtsoe 1954 169 A child can do the things which will give us power to nourish the faith of others Children could invite a recent convert to come with them to a meeting Children could smile and greet a new member coming into a chapel or into a class So can we And as surely as we do the Holy Ghost will be our companion The fear of not knowing what to say and of being rejected will be taken from us The newcomer will not appear to be a stranger to us And the Holy Ghost will begin nourishing them even before we have spoken of gospel truths It does not require a calling more than being a member to nourish by reaching out in kindness And even those who have no calling to teach or to preach can nourish with the good word of God if we prepare for it We can do it every time we speak with a new member and every time we participate in a class discussion Every word we speak can strengthen or weaken faith We need help from the Spirit to speak the words which will nourish and which will strengthen There are two great keys to inviting the Spirit to guide what words we speak as we feed others They are the daily study of the scriptures and the prayer of faith The Holy Ghost will guide what we say if we study and ponder the scriptures every day The words of the scriptures invite the Holy Spirit The Lord said it this way Seek not to declare my word but first seek to obtain my word and then shall your tongue be loosed then if you desire you shall have my Spirit and my word yea the power of God unto the convincing of men D C 11 21 With daily study of the scriptures we can count on this blessing even in casual conversations or in a class when we may be asked by a teacher to respond to a question We will experience the power the Lord promised Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man D C 84 85 We treasure the word of God not only by reading the words of the scriptures but by studying them We may be nourished more by pondering a few words allowing the Holy Ghost to make them treasures to us than to pass quickly and superficially over whole chapters of scripture Just as pondering the scriptures invites the Holy Ghost so does daily pleading in prayer If we do not ask in prayer He will rarely come and without our petition He is not likely to linger And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach D C 42 14 Heartfelt constant pleading for the companionship of the Holy Ghost with the pure intent to nourish our Father s children will surely bring blessings to us and to those we love and serve The good word of God with which we must nourish is the simple doctrine of the gospel We need not fear either simplicity or repetition The Lord himself described how that doctrine goes into the hearts of men and women to nourish them Behold verily verily I say unto you I will declare unto you my doctrine And this is my doctrine and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me and I bear record of the Father and the Father beareth record of me and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men everywhere to repent and believe in me And whoso believeth in me and is baptized the same shall be saved and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God And whoso believeth not in me and is not baptized shall be damned Verily verily I say unto you that this is my doctrine and I bear record of it from the Father and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also and unto him will the Father bear record of me for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost 3 Ne 11 31 35 The Lord went on to describe those who would be nourished by that simple doctrine and so endure those who would inherit the celestial kingdom as those who were childlike It takes a childlike heart to feel the promptings of the Spirit to surrender to those commands and to obey That is what it takes to be nourished by the good word of God And that is why we can be so optimistic in our charge to nourish the new members of the Church However much or little they knew of the doctrine they have just submitted humbly to the ordinance of baptism and received the right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost And so the very tenderness of their faith which leads the Savior to refer to them as lambs comes at a time when they have proven themselves willing to do what the Savior asks of them If the full requirements of their new membership are explained clearly and with love if the opportunity to serve in the Church is extended wisely and their performance in that service judged with charity and nurtured with patient encouragement they will be strengthened by the companionship of the Holy Ghost and then they will be nurtured by power beyond our own As they endure even the gates of hell will not prevail against them Brigham Young made the promise of how their strength to stand would grow in these words Those who humble themselves before the Lord and wait upon Him with a perfect heart and willing mind will receive little by little line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little Now and again as brother John Taylor says until they receive a certain amount Then they have to nourish and cherish what they receive and make it their constant companion encouraging every good thought doctrine and principle and doing every good work they can perform until by and bye the Lord is in them a well of water springing up unto everlasting life in Journal of Discourses 4 286 87 That is what it means in Moroni when it says Relying alone upon the merits of Christ who was the author and the finisher of their faith Moro 6 4 It is the Savior who made possible our being purified through His Atonement and our obedience to His commandments And it is the Savior who will nourish those who go down in faith into the waters of baptism and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost When they always remember Him and when they continue in childlike obedience it is He who will assure that they have His Spirit always to be with them You and I can and will by small means be part of a great work We will study and pray and serve to qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost We will then be allowed to see the new members as precious beloved children of our Heavenly Father and we will be led to nourish them with love with opportunity to serve and with the good word of God And then we will see in our own time what the great missionary Ammon described to his missionary companions just as we are now companions to the missionaries laboring across the world Behold the field was ripe and blessed are ye for ye did thrust in the sickle and did reap with your might yea all the day long did ye labor and behold the number of your sheaves And they shall be gathered into the garners that they are not wasted Yea they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day yea neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place that the storm cannot penetrate to them yea neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them But behold they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest and they are his and he will raise them up at the last day Alma 26 5 7 We can by simple obedience help the Lord to take the lambs His lambs into His hands and take them in His arms home to their Father and our Father I know that God will pour out the powers of heaven upon us as we join in preserving that sacred harvest of souls I know that Jesus is the Christ I know that He lives And I know that He leads His missionaries and that He leads us in this work His work to bring to pass the eternal life of His Father s children In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Savior has always been the protector of those who would accept His protection He has said more than once How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens and ye would not 3 Ne 10 5 The Lord expressed the same lament in our own dispensation after describing the many ways in which He calls us to safety How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants and by the ministering of angels and by mine own voice and by the voice of thunderings and by the voice of lightnings and by the voice of tempests and by the voice of earthquakes and great hailstorms and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind and by the great sound of a trump and by the voice of judgment and by the voice of mercy all the day long and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation but ye would not D C 43 25 There seems to be no end to the Savior s desire to lead us to safety And there is constancy in the way He shows us the path He calls by more than one means so that it will reach those willing to accept it And those means always include sending the message by the mouths of His prophets whenever people have qualified to have the prophets of God among them Those authorized servants are always charged with warning the people telling them the way to safety When tensions ran high in northern Missouri in the fall of 1838 the Prophet Joseph Smith called for all the Saints to gather to Far West for protection Many were on isolated farms or in scattered settlements He specifically counseled Jacob Haun founder of a small settlement called Haun s Mill A record of that time includes this Brother Joseph had sent word by Haun who owned the mill to inform the brethren who were living there to leave and come to Far West but Mr Haun did not deliver the message Philo Dibble in Early Scenes in Church History in Four Faith Promoting Classics 1968 90 Later the Prophet Joseph recorded in his history Up to this day God had given me wisdom to save the people who took counsel None had ever been killed who had abided by my counsel History of the Church 5 137 Then the Prophet recorded the sad truth that innocent lives could have been saved at Haun s Mill had his counsel been received and followed In our own time we have been warned with counsel of where to find safety from sin and from sorrow One of the keys to recognizing those warnings is that they are repeated For instance more than once in these general conferences you have heard our prophet say that he would quote a preceding prophet and would therefore be a second witness and sometimes even a third Each of us who has listened has heard President Kimball give counsel on the importance of a mother in the home and then heard President Benson quote him and we have heard President Hinckley quote them both The Apostle Paul wrote that in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established 2 Cor 13 1 One of the ways we may know that the warning is from the Lord is that the law of witnesses authorized witnesses has been invoked When the words of prophets seem repetitive that should rivet our attention and fill our hearts with gratitude to live in such a blessed time Looking for the path to safety in the counsel of prophets makes sense to those with strong faith When a prophet speaks those with little faith may think that they hear only a wise man giving good advice Then if his counsel seems comfortable and reasonable squaring with what they want to do they take it If it does not they consider it either faulty advice or they see their circumstances as justifying their being an exception to the counsel Those without faith may think that they hear only men seeking to exert influence for some selfish motive They may mock and deride as did a man named Korihor with these words recorded in the Book of Mormon And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers and according to your own desires and ye keep them down even as it were in bondage that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands that they durst not look up with boldness and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges Alma 30 27 Korihor was arguing as men and women have falsely argued from the beginning of time that to take counsel from the servants of God is to surrender God given rights of independence But the argument is false because it misrepresents reality When we reject the counsel which comes from God we do not choose to be independent of outside influence We choose another influence We reject the protection of a perfectly loving all powerful all knowing Father in Heaven whose whole purpose as that of His Beloved Son is to give us eternal life to give us all that He has and to bring us home again in families to the arms of His love In rejecting His counsel we choose the influence of another power whose purpose is to make us miserable and whose motive is hatred We have moral agency as a gift of God Rather than the right to choose to be free of influence it is the inalienable right to submit ourselves to whichever of those powers we choose Another fallacy is to believe that the choice to accept or not accept the counsel of prophets is no more than deciding whether to accept good advice and gain its benefits or to stay where we are But the choice not to take prophetic counsel changes the very ground upon which we stand It becomes more dangerous The failure to take prophetic counsel lessens our power to take inspired counsel in the future The best time to have decided to help Noah build the ark was the first time he asked Each time he asked after that each failure to respond would have lessened sensitivity to the Spirit And so each time his request would have seemed more foolish until the rain came And then it was too late Every time in my life when I have chosen to delay following inspired counsel or decided that I was an exception I came to know that I had put myself in harm s way Every time that I have listened to the counsel of prophets felt it confirmed in prayer and then followed it I have found that I moved toward safety Along the path I have found that the way had been prepared for me and the rough places made smooth God led me to safety along a path which was prepared with loving care sometimes prepared long before The account at the beginning of the Book of Mormon is of a prophet of God Lehi He was also the leader of a family He was warned by God to take those he loved to safety Lehi s experience is a type of what happens as God gives counsel through His servants Of Lehi s family only those who had faith and who themselves received confirming revelation saw both the danger and the way to safety For those without faith the move into the wilderness seemed not only foolish but dangerous Like all prophets Lehi to his dying day tried to show his family where safety would lie for them He knew that the Savior holds responsible those to whom He delegates priesthood keys With those keys comes the power to give counsel that will show us the way to safety Those with keys are responsible to warn even when their counsel might not be followed Keys are delegated down a line which passes from the prophet through those responsible for ever smaller groups of members closer and closer to families and to individuals That is one of the ways by which the Lord makes a stake a place of safety For instance I have sat with my wife in a meeting of parents called by our bishop our neighbor so that he could warn us of spiritual dangers faced by our children I heard more than the voice of my wise friend I heard a servant of Jesus Christ with keys meeting his responsibility to warn and passing to us the parents the responsibility to act When we honor the keys of that priesthood channel by listening and giving heed we tie ourselves to a lifeline which will not fail us in any storm Our Heavenly Father loves us He sent His Only Begotten Son to be our Savior He knew that in mortality we would be in grave danger the worst of it from the temptations of a terrible adversary That is one of the reasons why the Savior has provided priesthood keys so that those with ears to hear and faith to obey could go to places of safety Having listening ears requires humility You remember the Lord s warning to Thomas B Marsh He was then the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles The Lord knew that President Marsh and his brethren of the Twelve would be tested He gave counsel about taking counsel The Lord said Be thou humble and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers D C 112 10 The Lord added a warning that is applicable to any who follow a living prophet Exalt not yourselves rebel not against my servant Joseph for verily I say unto you I am with him and my hand shall be over him and the keys which I have given unto him and also to youward shall not be taken from him till I come D C 112 15 God offers us counsel not just for our own safety but for the safety of His other children whom we should love There are few comforts so sweet as to know that we have been an instrument in the hands of God in leading someone else to safety That blessing generally requires the faith to follow counsel when it is hard to do An example from Church history is that of Reddick Newton Allred He was one of the rescue party sent out by Brigham Young to bring in the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies When a terrible storm hit Captain Grant captain of the rescue party decided to leave some of the wagons by the Sweetwater River as he pressed ahead to find the handcart companies With the blizzards howling and the weather becoming life threatening two of the men left behind at the Sweetwater decided that it was foolish to stay They thought that either the handcart companies had wintered over somewhere or had perished They decided to return to the Salt Lake Valley and tried to persuade everyone else to do the same Reddick Allred refused to budge Brigham had sent them out and his priesthood leader had told him to wait there The others took several wagons all filled with needed supplies and started back Even more tragic each wagon they met coming out from Salt Lake they turned back as well They turned back 77 wagons returning all the way to Little Mountain where President Young learned what was happening and turned them around again When the Willie Company was finally found and had made that heartrending pull up and over Rocky Ridge it was Reddick Allred and his wagons that waited for them See Rebecca Bartholomew and Leonard J Arrington Rescue of the 1856 Handcart Companies 1992 29 33 34 In this conference you will hear inspired counsel for instance to reach out to the new members of the Church Those with the faith of Reddick Newton Allred will keep offering friendship even when it seems not to be needed or to have no effect They will persist When some new member reaches the point of spiritual exhaustion they will be there offering kind words and fellowship They will then feel the same divine approval Brother Allred felt when he saw those handcart pioneers struggling toward him knowing he could offer them safety because he had followed counsel when it was hard to do While the record does not prove it I am confident that Brother Allred prayed while he waited I am confident that his prayers were answered He then knew that the counsel to stand fast was from God We must pray to know that I promise you answers to such prayers of faith Sometimes we will receive counsel that we cannot understand or that seems not to apply to us even after careful prayer and thought Don t discard the counsel but hold it close If someone you trusted handed you what appeared to be nothing more than sand with the promise that it contained gold you might wisely hold it in your hand awhile shaking it gently Every time I have done that with counsel from a prophet after a time the gold flakes have begun to appear and I have been grateful We are blessed to live in a time when the priesthood keys are on the earth We are blessed to know where to look and how to listen for the voice that will fulfill the promise of the Lord that He will gather us to safety I pray for you and for me that we will have humble hearts that we will listen that we will pray that we will wait for the deliverance of the Lord which is sure to come as we are faithful I testify that God our Heavenly Father lives and loves us This is the Church of Jesus Christ He lives and loves us He is the head of the Church and He is our Savior I testify that Gordon B Hinckley holds all the keys of the priesthood of God In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Latter day Saints are a covenant people From the day of baptism through the spiritual milestones of our lives we make promises with God and He makes promises with us He always keeps His promises offered through His authorized servants but it is the crucial test of our lives to see if we will make and keep our covenants with Him I saw again the power of keeping covenants through a chance conversation with a man I sat down next to on a trip I had never met him before but apparently he had seen me in the crowd because his first words after I introduced myself were I ve been watching you He told me about his work I told him about mine He asked about my family and then he told me something about his He said that his wife was a member of the Church and that he was not After he came to trust me he said something like this You know there is something in your church you should fix You need to tell your people when to quit He explained that he and his wife had been married for 25 years She had been a member of the Church since childhood In their years of marriage she had only once stepped into a building of the Church and that was to tour a temple before its dedication and then only because her parents had arranged it Then he told me why he thought we ought to make a change He said that in those 25 years of married life in which his wife showed no interest in the Church visiting teachers and home teachers had never stopped coming to their home He told of one evening when he went out to walk his dog alone only to find the home teacher happening by with his dog eager to visit with him He told with a touch of exasperation of another night when he came home from a long business trip put his car in the garage and then came out to find his home teachers standing there smiling He said to me something like And there they were right in my face with another plate of cookies I think I understood his feelings And then I tried as best I could to tell him how hard it would be to teach such teachers to quit I told him that the love that he had felt from those many visitors and their constancy over the years in the face of little response came from a covenant they had made with God I told him about the baptismal covenant as Alma described it in the Book of Mormon I didn t quote these words but you will remember them as Alma asked those he had taught whether they wished to be baptized And it came to pass that he said unto them Behold here are the waters of Mormon for thus were they called and now as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God and to be called his people and are willing to bear one another s burdens that they may be light Yea and are willing to mourn with those that mourn yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places that ye may be in even until death that ye may be redeemed of God and be numbered with those of the first resurrection that ye may have eternal life Mosiah 18 8 9 Those home teachers and visiting teachers understood and believed that the covenant to be a witness and to love were intertwined and that they reinforced each other There is no other way to explain what had happened My new friend recognized that the visitors had genuine concern for him and for his wife And he knew their caring sprang from a belief that impelled them to come back He seemed at least to me to understand that those visitors were driven from within by a covenant they would not break As we parted I think he knew why he could expect that there would be more visits more evidence of caring and more patient waiting for the opportunity to bear testimony of the restored gospel As we parted I realized that I had learned something too I will never again see home teaching or visiting teaching as only programs of the Church Those faithful teachers saw what they were doing for what it really was Such work is an opportunity not a burden Every member has made the covenant in the waters of baptism to be a witness for God Every member has made a covenant to do works of kindness as the Savior would do So any call to bear witness and to care for others is not a request for extra service it is a blessing designed by a loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ They have provided such calls as well as other settings sometimes without a formal call all for the same purpose Each is a chance to prove what blessings flow from being a covenant people and each is an opportunity for which you agreed to be accountable Each is a sacred responsibility for others accepted in the waters of baptism but too often not met because it may not be recognized for what it is The power of that covenant to love and to witness should transform what members do in other settings across the world One of the most important is in the family Prophets in our time have consolidated our meetings on Sunday to allow time for families to be together The prophets have also been inspired to help us reserve Monday night for family home evenings Those opportunities require choices In thousands of homes the choices made are guided by the covenant to comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God Both the consolidation of the Sunday meetings and the creation of a family home evening are to provide opportunity for families to have time together to give Christlike service and to study the scriptures and gospel principles The power of that possibility was taught by President Spencer W Kimball this way I wonder what this world would be like if every father and mother gathered their children around them at least once a week explained the gospel and bore fervent testimonies to them How could immorality continue and infidelity break families and delinquency spawn The Teachings of Spencer W Kimball ed Edward L Kimball 1982 345 There are in those hours on Sunday and in a family home evening on Monday the opportunity to combine genuine caring teaching the gospel and the bearing of testimony Across the earth there are families who love and understand their covenants who do that From my front window I have seen parents their children at their sides move down the street to the home of a neighbor to offer comfort to give Christlike service I wasn t there to see it but surely the warmth of those moments lingered later at home when a song of Zion was sung a prayer given that likely included a plea for the person visited a scripture read a short lesson taught and testimonies of the restored gospel borne There is a caution I would give and a promise I would offer about such choices of how to use family time For a person not yet a member of the Church to fail to provide such moments of love and faith is simply a lost opportunity But for those under covenant it is much more There are few places where the covenant to love and to bear witness is more easily kept than in the home And there are few places where it can matter more for those for whom we are accountable For members of the Church my caution is that to neglect those opportunities is a choice not to keep sacred covenants Because God always honors covenants I can make a promise to those who in faith keep the covenant to create experiences of giving love and bearing testimony with their families They will reap a harvest of hearts touched faith in Jesus Christ exercised unto repentance and the desire and the power to keep covenants strengthened There is another circumstance in which the covenant to combine kindness with bearing witness has great power to change lives Thousands of times every day members of the Church are watched as I was by the man I met on a trip by people curious to know something about our lives Because we are under covenant to be a witness we will try to tell them how the gospel has brought us happiness What they think of what we say may depend largely on how much they sense we care for them That was true when King Lamoni met Ammon as we have it described in the Book of Mormon Ammon had been captured by guards and brought to the king who could take his life But apparently within minutes King Lamoni recognized that Ammon cared enough for him to want to serve him Ammon said when offered high station Nay but I will be thy servant Alma 17 25 Within days the king knew that Ammon was willing to risk his life for him And then came the opportunity for Ammon to be a witness of God to the king Those we meet will feel the love that springs from our long practice in keeping a covenant to mourn with those that mourn yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort Mosiah 18 9 It may not be in hours or days as it was for King Lamoni but they will feel our love after testing our hearts And when they find our concern sincere the Holy Spirit can more easily touch them to allow us to teach and to testify as it did for Ammon Again I have a caution and a promise The caution is that sorrow will come from failure either to love or to bear witness If we fail to feel and show honest concern for those we approach with the gospel they will reasonably distrust our message But if out of fear of rejection we fail to tell them what the gospel has meant in our lives and could mean in theirs we will someday share their sorrow Either in this life or in the life to come they will know that we failed to share with them the priceless gift of the gospel They will know that accepting the gospel was the only way for them to inherit eternal life And they will know that we received the gospel with a promise that we would share it I can make two promises to those who offer the gospel to others The first is that even those who reject it will someday thank us More than once I have asked missionaries to visit friends far from where I lived learned that the missionaries had been rejected and then received a letter from my friend with words like this I was honored that you would offer to me something that I knew meant so much to you If not in this life such messages will be sent to us in the world to come when those we approached will know the truth and how much we cared for them My second promise is that as you offer the gospel to others it will go down more deeply into your own heart It becomes the well of water springing up into eternal life for us as we offer it to others There is one other setting which provides a near perfect opportunity to combine love and testimony In every ward and branch in the Church once a month we hold a fast and testimony meeting We fast for two meals With the money saved and adding more to it whenever we can we pay a generous fast offering The bishop and the branch president use those offerings under inspiration to care for the poor and the needy Thus by paying a fast offering we give comfort to those in need of comfort as we promised that we would The fast also helps us to feel humble and meek so that the Holy Ghost may more easily be our companion By our fast we both keep our covenant to care for others and we prepare to keep our covenant to bear testimony Those who have prepared carefully for the fast and testimony meeting won t need to be reminded how to bear testimony should they feel impressed to do it in the meeting They won t give sermons or exhortations or travel reports or try to entertain as they bear witness Because they will have already expressed appreciation to people privately they will have less need to do it publicly Neither will they feel a need to use eloquent language nor to go on at length A testimony is a simple expression of what we feel The member who has fasted both for the blessing of the poor and for the companionship of the Spirit will be feeling gratitude for the love of God and the certainty of eternal truth Even a child can feel such things which may be why sometimes the testimony of a child so moves us and why our preparation of fasting and prayer produces in us childlike feelings That preparation for the fast and testimony meeting is a covenant obligation for members of the Church The offering of the gospel to those we meet and to our families are covenant obligations We can take heart that our honest effort to keep our covenants allows God to increase our power to do it We all need that assurance at times when our promise to love and to witness seems hard for us The fruit of keeping covenants is the companionship of the Holy Ghost and an increase in the power to love That happens because of the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to change our very natures We are eyewitnesses of that miracle of greater spiritual power coming to those who accept covenants and keep commandments For instance there are families across the Church who read and reread letters from their missionary children with wonder and a few tears at the miracle that in so short a time they have become new better people Yet I have also seen that same miracle in a mature man and woman called to serve as proselyting missionary companions in the most difficult of circumstances which would have taxed the bravest youth As the husband made his report I thought back to the man I had known I realized that the promised miracle of spiritual growth is not a product of youth but of the faith simply to try to keep covenants That couple went out to love the people and to bear witness and they returned transformed as much as any 21 year old Each of us who have made covenants with God face challenges unique to us But each of us shares some common assurances Our Heavenly Father knows us and our circumstances and even what faces us in the future His Beloved Son Jesus Christ our Savior has suffered and paid for our sins and those of all the people we will ever meet He has perfect understanding of the feelings the suffering the trials and the needs of every individual Because of that a way will be prepared for us to keep our covenants however difficult that may now appear if we go forward in faith I share with you the obligation to be a witness for God at all times and in all places that I will be in as long as I live And I share with you the confidence that God can grant us the power to keep all our covenants I am grateful that I know as surely as did the Apostles Peter James and John that Jesus is the Christ our risen Lord and that he is our advocate with the Father I know that the Father bore direct witness of His Beloved Son by introducing the resurrected Lord to the boy Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove I know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God translated by the Prophet Joseph through the power of God I know that the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood were restored by those who received them from the Savior and that President Gordon B Hinckley is now the only person on earth authorized to direct the use of all those keys I bear solemn testimony that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ in which the ordinances and the covenants are offered which if accepted and honored produce peace in this life and assure us eternal life in the world to come In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Hearts were touched by the proclamation on the family read by President Hinckley last fall because we want for our families what God wants for them that they will live in love and righteousness But in our thoughtful moments we know that we will need help We will need to invite the powers of heaven to guide our families in days when we are not there and to face spiritual dangers we may not foresee Our families can be given a gift to know what God would have them do and to learn it in a way that will encourage them to do it God has provided such a guide It is the Holy Ghost We cannot give that to our family members as a companion but they can earn it The Holy Ghost can be their constant companion only after they have been faithful and after they have received the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands by those with proper authority But even before baptism a child or an adult can have the Holy Ghost testify to their hearts of sacred truth They must act on that testimony to retain it but it will guide them toward goodness and it can lead them to accept and keep the covenants which will in time bring them the companionship of the Holy Ghost We would if we could leave our families a legacy of testimony that it might reach through the generations What we can do to create and transmit that legacy comes from an understanding of how testimony is instilled in our hearts Since it is the Holy Ghost who testifies of sacred truth we can do at least three things to make that experience more likely for our families First we can teach some sacred truth Then we can testify that we know what we have taught is true And then we must act so that those who hear our testimony see that our actions conform with what we said was true The Holy Ghost will then confirm to them the truth of what we said and that we knew it to be true That is how a legacy of testimony is created preserved and transmitted in a family It isn t easy but ordinary people have done it Like many of you I had such ancestors One was my great grandfather John Bennion We cannot duplicate what he did because the world has changed but we can learn from it He was a convert to the Church from Wales He his wife and his children came into the Salt Lake Valley in one of the early companies of pioneers We know something of his life because after that time he kept a journal making a short entry nearly every day We have the journals from 1855 to 1877 They were published in one bound volume because his descendants hoped to transmit that legacy of testimony My mother was one of them Her last labor before she died was to transform the day books in which he d written into a manuscript for publication His short entries don t have much preaching in them He doesn t testify that he knew Brigham Young was a prophet He just records having answered yes every time the prophet called him on a mission from over Jordan to the Muddy mission then on to a mission back to Wales He also answered yes to the call to ride into the canyons to track Johnston s army and the call to take his family south when the army invaded the valley There is even a family legend that the reason he died so close to the day when Brigham Young was buried was to follow the prophet one more time The fact that he wrote every day makes clear to me that he knew his ordinary life was historic because it was part of the building of Zion in the latter days The few entries which record his testimony seem to appear when death took a child His testimony is to me more powerful because he offered it when his soul was tried Here is his record of one of those times His daughter Elizabeth died in his arms He reported her burial and the location of her grave in a few lines But then the next day November fourth of 1863 this is the entire entry Wednesday Repairing up the stable my little children pratling around me but I miss my dear Lizzy I pray the Lord to help me to indure faithfull to his cause to the end of my days that I may be worthy to receive my children back into the family circle who have fallen asleep in Christ in the days of their innocence Ann Moroni Esther Ellen Elizabeth blessed happy are they because of the atonement of Jesus Christ All the elements are there He taught the truth He testified that it was true He lived consistent with his testimony and prayed that he might endure faithful until he could be united with his dear family I feel his love and a desire to be included in that circle We must find other ways to convey our legacy of testimony but the process of teaching testifying and living the truth will be the same The scriptures living prophets and common sense tell us where to begin We need to start with ourselves as parents No program we follow or family tradition we create can transmit a legacy of testimony we do not have We must start where Alma started so that our descendants can know that we testified from the same ground from which he testified Here are his words as recorded in the Book of Mormon It is what we must be able to say And this is not all Do ye not suppose that I know of these things myself Behold I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety Behold I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God Behold I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself And now I do know of myself that they are true for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me Alma 5 45 46 As we gain that assurance most settings we will be in with our families will be good ones to create a legacy of testimony Some of the best are already familiar to us Here are some ways to make those common settings more likely to invite the experiences which bring testimony to our families First plan for our weekly family night to be a setting for the bearing of testimony Be sure that some truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ is taught simply and plainly so that even a child could understand A child could do the teaching The child may choose to end with a testimony if that is the way we end our teaching A shy child may not easily bear testimony in larger settings but may in the safety of our homes And the Holy Ghost will testify to those who hear and to the child who testifies Second read the scriptures aloud together as a family It may take unusual determination and inspiration to find a time and a setting But reading and hearing the words of life from the scriptures will invite the Holy Ghost to confirm their truth The Savior said it this way Search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me John 5 39 From this pulpit years ago President Marion G Romney recounted reading the Book of Mormon aloud alternating paragraphs with his young son he on the bottom level of a double decker bed and his son on the upper He thought his son was catching a cold but then learned that the tears came from his son feeling testimony that the book was true And because they read together both were blessed See Conference Report Apr 1949 41 Third kneel together in humble prayer as a family each having the opportunity to be voice There may be times when the prayer seems rote and when those not praying let their minds wander But there will be other priceless moments when someone will petition in faith for real needs and the Holy Ghost will touch hearts with testimony I don t remember as much of my mother s teaching as I do her prayers for us I could feel her love and the Spirit confirmed in my heart that she loved Heavenly Father and the Savior and that her prayers would be answered She brought blessings down on our heads then and the memory of her prayers still does Fourth fast and allow your children to fast once a month before the meeting in which they will partake of the Lord s Supper hear others bear testimony and perhaps themselves feel prompted to testify The spiritual blessing will be even greater for them if they know that their choice to overcome their physical desires for food is making possible the caring for the poor That can t happen unless we pay a generous fast offering with a joyful heart It can if we do And the likelihood will be greatly increased that they will feel the Spirit confirm that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ if we have first taught and testified that the Savior always organizes his disciples to care for the poor and the needy among them We could extend the list of things to do to invite the confirmation of the Holy Spirit For instance the warmth and confidence with which we receive home teachers can allow our children to feel confirmation that they come as God s servants The giving of priesthood blessings as children start a school year or leave home invites the Spirit at a time when hearts are humble and thus receptive to the whisperings of the Spirit Some of the greatest opportunities to create and transmit a legacy of testimony cannot be planned Tragedy loss and hurt often arrive unanticipated How we react when we are surprised will tell our families whether what we have taught and testified lies deep in our hearts Most of us will have taught our children of the power of the Savior to carry us through whatever befalls us These words are from the Book of Mormon And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities Alma 7 12 When tragedy strikes or even when it looms our families will have the opportunity to look into our hearts to see whether we know what we said we knew Our children will watch feel the Spirit confirm that we lived as we preached remember that confirmation and pass the story across the generations I have one such story in my legacy Grandmother Eyring learned from a doctor in his office that she would die of stomach cancer My father her oldest son had driven her there and was waiting for her He told me that on the way home she said Now Henry let s be cheerful Let s sing hymns They sang O My Father Hymns no 292 and Come Come Ye Saints where the last verse begins And should we die before our journey s through Hymns no 30 I wasn t there but I imagine they sang loudly they didn t have very melodic voices with faith and no tears She spent part of her last months in the home of her oldest child her daughter Aunt Camilla told me that Grandma complained only once and then it was not really a complaint but just to say that it hurt Now there are many people who have been cheerful and brave in the face of death But it means far more to her family when the person has taught and testified of the power of the Savior to succor of the sureness of the Resurrection and of the hope of eternal life The Spirit confirmed to me that Grandma s peace and her courage were signs that her testimony was true and because of that all was well all was well Sadly each of us knows that even teaching testifying and living true to that testimony may not pass on the legacy Great and good parents have done that and then seen their families or some in their families reject that testimony There is reason for us to have great hope and optimism It comes first from our testimony of the nature of our Heavenly Father he loves our family members he is their Heavenly Father as well as ours It also comes from our testimony of the mission of Jesus Christ he paid the price to redeem them And it comes from our testimony of the restoration of priesthood keys Because of that the power is on the earth again to make covenants with God which seals families together covenants which God honors That is why we must not despair As we offer the legacy of testimony to our families some may not receive it It may even seem to skip over generations But God will reach out to offer the legacy again and again More than we can imagine our faithful effort to offer to our family the testimony we have of the truth will be multiplied in power and extended in time We have all seen evidence of that in families we have known I saw it in South America as I looked into the faces of missionaries Hundreds of them passed by me shaking my hand and looking deeply into my eyes I was nearly overwhelmed with the confirmation that these children of Father Lehi and of Sariah were there in the Lord s service because our Heavenly Father honors His promises to families To nearly his last breath Lehi taught and testified and tried to bless his children Terrible tragedy came among his descendants when they rejected his testimony the testimonies of other prophets and of the scriptures But in the eyes and faces of those missionaries I felt confirmation that God has kept his promises to reach out to Lehi s covenant children and that he will reach out to ours I testify that I know that God our Heavenly Father lives and that he loves us and that he knows us I know that Jesus Christ lives and that we will be resurrected and can be sanctified because of his sacrifice I testify that we can know the truth by the power of the Holy Ghost I know that we can live together in families in eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God I pray that we may with all our hearts for all our lives offer testimony of the truth to our families In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am grateful that we are assembled as the priesthood of God tonight presided over by the prophet who holds and exercises the keys of the holy priesthood in all the world President Hinckley spoke in the Sunday morning session of conference last April Near the end of that talk he said this Now my brethren and sisters in conclusion I wish to leave with you one thought which I hope you will never forget With that introduction which surely caught our attention he then said This church does not belong to its President Its head is the Lord Jesus Christ whose name each of us has taken upon ourselves We are all in this great endeavor together We are here to assist our Father in His work and His glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility as is my obligation in my sphere No calling in this church is small or of little consequence All of us in the pursuit of our duty touch the lives of others To each of us in our respective responsibilities the Lord has said Wherefore be faithful stand in the office which I have appointed unto you succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees D C 81 5 in Conference Report Apr 1995 p 94 or Ensign May 1995 p 71 You must have wondered about that idea that your calling carries for you as serious a responsibility as his does for him But you can see why that must be so You and he are called by the same Savior whose church this is You are involved in the same work which is to help the Lord to bring to pass the eternal life of man In your calling you touch lives The life you touch in your service will be as valuable to God as any other life And so how you touch a life is as serious a matter for you as it would be for any other servant of God That seriousness comes from your assigned purpose Your responsibility is to touch people so that they will make the choices that will take them toward eternal life And eternal life is the greatest of all the gifts of God Some of you young men may feel uncomfortable with the thought that what may seem to you simple assignments or everyday acts could have eternal consequences But you may have done more than you know Your deacons quorum president next week may ask you to invite to come with you to a Sunday meeting a boy who has never attended nor has anyone in his family You may trudge up to his house get him to come with you a few times and then see him move away You may think you haven t done much that mattered But the grandfather of such a boy came up to me during a stake conference described in detail how a deacon had done just that for his grandson more than ten years before and almost a continent away and with tears in his eyes asked me if I could thank that deacon for him now grown older unaware that the Savior had reached out through a twelve year old servant assigned by a thirteen year old quorum president Some of you brethren know the feelings of that grandfather The mother of his grandson was raising him alone with no contact with the Church The grandfather had tried every way he knew to reach out to touch their lives He loved them He felt responsible for her and for his grandson And he knew what you know He knew that someday when they saw things as they really are they would wish with all their hearts that they had made the choices that would qualify them for eternal life choices which won t and can t be made without faith in Jesus Christ sufficient to salvation His heartache was one most of us have felt over someone we cared about and could not seem to reach And that heartache will lead you to ponder and pray for the answer to this question How can I touch a life with faith A place to begin your pondering is with the Savior and his disciples Early in his mortal ministry they wanted him to touch their lives with faith And the apostles said unto the Lord Increase our faith And the Lord said If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree Be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you Luke 17 5 6 You will not be surprised that the Lord responded by speaking of a seed The first thing to know about how faith in him increases is to think of its growth like that of a tree You remember how Alma used that illustration The seed is the word of God It must be planted in the heart of the person you serve and whose faith you want to see increase He described what must happen this way Now we will compare the word unto a seed Now if ye give place that a seed may be planted in your heart behold if it be a true seed or a good seed if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord behold it will begin to swell within your breasts and when you feel these swelling motions ye will begin to say within yourselves It must needs be that this is a good seed or that the word is good for it beginneth to enlarge my soul yea it beginneth to enlighten my understanding yea it beginneth to be delicious to me Now behold would not this increase your faith I say unto you Yea Alma 32 28 29 Just as soil needs preparation for a seed so does a human heart for the word of God to take root Before he told the people to plant the seed Alma told them that their hearts were prepared They had been persecuted and cast out of their churches Alma with his love and the circumstances of their lives which led them to be humble had prepared them They were then ready to hear the word of God If they chose to plant it in their hearts the growth in their souls would surely follow and that would increase their faith It s not hard to see from these examples what you can do to touch someone s life with faith To begin with you recognize that what people choose to do and what the Savior has done will matter more than what you do But there are things you can do to make it more likely that they will make the choices that will move them toward eternal life You know first of all that to plant the seed they must do more than hear the word of God They have to try it by keeping commandments The Lord said it this way Jesus answered them and said My doctrine is not mine but his that sent me If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself John 7 16 17 It won t be enough for them simply to listen to the word of God They must choose to keep commandments because they feel at least a beginning desire to know the will of our Heavenly Father and submit to it That feeling of surrender is not likely to come unless they experience some feeling of being loved and some value in their being meek and lowly of heart You can help with your example If you love them because you feel God s love for them they will feel that If you are meek and humble because you feel your dependence on God they will sense that too In addition to your example you can teach the word of God to them in a way that is more likely to give them a desire to repent and to try to live it They may think they have heard preaching enough But they must do more than hear the word of God they must plant it in their hearts by trying it You can make that more likely if you talk with them about it in a way that helps them feel how much God loves them and how much they need God Aaron one of the great missionaries in the Book of Mormon knew how to teach that way You remember how he taught King Lamoni s father the old king The king s heart had already been prepared by seeing love and humility in the way Aaron s brother had treated Lamoni his son But even with that preparation of the old king s heart Aaron taught the word of God in a way to emphasize God s love and our need for him Listen to this description of how he did it And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words he began from the creation of Adam reading the scriptures unto the king how God created man after his own image and that God gave him commandments and that because of transgression man had fallen And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam laying the fall of man before him and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption which was prepared from the foundation of the world through Christ for all whosoever would believe on his name Alma 22 12 13 You won t very often have the remarkable result that Aaron had After hearing the word of God taught that way in what the scriptures sometimes call the plan of happiness the old king said that he would give whatever he had to root the wickedness out of him and have eternal life When Aaron told him to cry to God in prayer for forgiveness the king bowed down on the spot The seed was planted He was doing the will of God see Alma 22 15 18 When you touch the hearts of people you serve you won t do everything exactly the way Aaron did But you will do some of the same things You will try to help them feel that God loves them by the way you treat them You will be humble so that they are more likely to choose to be meek and lowly of heart You will teach the word of God when the Spirit prompts you in a way that testifies of God s love for them and their need for the atonement of Jesus Christ And you will teach them commandments they can keep That is why when you go into the mission field you learn to commit those you teach to pray or to read the Book of Mormon or to come with you to a sacrament meeting or to be baptized You know that when they keep commandments they plant the seed And you know that it will grow their souls will be expanded and that when that happens their faith will increase You not only know what to do but you know when the Spirit is apt to prompt you to do it The times people will be most likely to choose to try the word of God to repent will be when they feel at least the beginnings of his love for them and their dependence on him For instance wise bishops have learned that funerals can be such times When death occurs in a family the bishop quorum members and the home and visiting teachers reach out to the family because they love them The family generally feel humbled longing for comfort and peace For many their hearts will be prepared to hear the word of God The bishop will know that as he plans the funeral service He will be sure that testimony is given of the plan of salvation of the atonement of Jesus Christ of the Resurrection and of glorious reunions because that will bring comfort and hope But such teaching will do more than that The word of God will be heard by people with hearts softened by love and by grief and so more likely to choose living it more fully And from doing that faith will increase and the changes will come in people which move them toward eternal life Your opportunities won t come only at times of great tragedy or overwhelming need Life has in it moments of challenge that will bring even the people most hardened to spiritual things to say to themselves Isn t there more than this If you have been a constant friend if you have proved your love by service and so become trusted they may turn to you with that question When they do you can say knowing that their hearts are prepared Yes there is and I can tell you where it is and what you can do to find it Your teaching will become easier as those you serve try the word of God For instance a deacon or an elder might choose to follow the command to search the scriptures and so read passages that tell him of the honor and glory bestowed through the holy priesthood D C 124 34 From such obedience in reading scriptures he might be able to hear the Holy Ghost whisper that such an honor such a holy calling deserves wearing better than everyday clothes when he performs priesthood ordinances or more considerate speech wherever they are Because others may not honor the dignity of the priesthood in those ways such obedience may take faith But faith when exercised increases And that increase in faith will give greater power to hear and to obey Now you will have great moments in your service to others as they discover the source of faith or when that faith leads them to go through the pain of repentance to gain the peace of forgiveness But even people with faith developed by obedience and with sins washed away will need your help to refresh and strengthen their faith There are reasons for that Blessings when they are no longer seen as coming from our Heavenly Father can lead to pride The peace of forgiveness can lead to overconfidence forgetting to pray always lest we be overcome Even some who have exercised faith enough to have great spiritual experiences have later been deceived into apostasy or overcome with the trials of life All of them need your help in nurturing faith in learning to put all their trust in God For all those you serve wherever they may be in the tests of life the way you nurture will be much the same You will love them You will encourage them as they choose to be humble You will present the word of God to them in the way most likely to lead to their choosing to exercise enough faith to repent and thus see that there is more that God would have them do And that will help them endure in faith Now your responsibility to touch lives might seem overwhelming You can take heart that you were called by the Savior You have the same promise he gave those he called at the beginning of his earthly ministry He called first humble men uneducated with less schooling and less gospel knowledge than the most recently ordained of you may have But listen to what he said and know that it applies to you And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers And he saith unto them Follow me and I will make you fishers of men And they straightway left their nets and followed him Matt 4 18 20 He will make you a fisher of men however inadequate you may feel now It won t be done by a mysterious process It will be the natural result of your choosing to follow him Just think about what you must do to be a fisher of men to touch lives with faith for him You will need to love the people you serve You will need to be humble and full of hope You will need to have the Holy Ghost as your companion to know when to speak and what to say and how to testify But all of that will come naturally in time from the covenants you make and keep as you follow him Here is the description of how that will happen from the eighth chapter of Moroni the twenty fifth and twenty sixth verses Moro 8 25 26 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins And the remission of sins bringeth meekness and lowliness of heart and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love which love endureth by diligence unto prayer until the end shall come when all the saints shall dwell with God You may not have seen that mighty change in yourself yet But it will come as you continue to follow him You can trust that he will qualify you as his servant to assist him in touching lives with faith to bring to pass the eternal life of man And you will find satisfaction in that service beyond your fondest dreams I testify that God the Father lives and that he loves you I testify that Jesus is the Christ that he called you and that he atoned for your sins and those of all you will ever serve I testify that President Gordon B Hinckley holds the keys that allow us to offer to our Father s children the covenants and ordinances that can qualify them for eternal life And I pray with all my heart that we may touch lives with faith enough to repent and to make and keep those sacred covenants In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Many years ago I went on assignment to Brazil As part of the trip I was to travel by car from S o Paulo to a conference in a city about two hours distant A member of the Quorum of the Twelve was going to preside at that conference I hoped to ride in the car with him so that I might learn But he suggested that I make the trip in another car with missionaries He said Teach them while you travel So when I climbed into the front seat of the car I learned that two young lady missionaries companions were going to that city for a transfer After we had become acquainted I leaned back over the seat and asked What would you like to know about Both of them eagerly and almost in chorus said Tell us how we can become more humble You might have struggled with that as I did I only remember the green hills of Brazil going by as I tried And the feeling at the end that I failed If only I could have that chance again on this beautiful day I have learned some things about their question since President Hinckley invited me to meet with him yesterday afternoon and issued the call to this sacred office I think I could help them a little more now First I would have realized that they already had the first lesson in their hearts The fact that they even asked meant that they had gone beyond being overwhelmed by their doubts about themselves to hope that if they would just submit if they could just learn what to do they could be better If I had the chance again I would have told them that And then I would have given them just this one bit of counsel counsel about what to do I would have said just this Always remember him Moro 4 3 Moro 5 2 D C 20 77 79 I would have tried to help them do that by taking them in their minds to a garden where they would hear the Savior of the world s words Father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done Luke 22 42 And then I would have taken them forward in time to that glorious day reported in the Book of Mormon when the resurrected Lord appeared to the people in the Americas and said And behold I am the light and the life of the world and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning 3 Ne 11 11 I know from the softness I heard in their voices and saw in their eyes that those missionaries would have then and perhaps always remembered him And from his perfect example they would have felt their hearts breaking and received the answer to their pleading Tell us how we can become more humble When we drove away from them in the city of our destination they were standing waiting for a bus I looked back There they stood alone I wish I had known what I learned last night so that I could have read to them while they were in the car these words from the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants the twenty third verse D C 1 23 That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world and before kings and rulers And then starting at the twenty sixth verse And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened that they might repent And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong and blessed from on high and receive knowledge from time to time D C 1 26 28 They would have known the Savior spoke of them And then in their humility they would have found that they were given power to proclaim his name Over the last hours I have come to understand other blessings from always remembering him I thought of a family in Albuquerque New Mexico I met years ago a father mother and two teenage daughters who belonged to no church but read the Bible together every day They pondered the Savior s life and his words When we found them they had decided that Christ would have a church and that they should find it They knew that it would have prophets and Apostles at its foundation because that is what Christ had left in his church in the meridian of time They knew that the resurrected Lord had appeared to his Apostles And so when we testified that God the Father and his Son the Savior of the world came to a boy prophet Joseph Smith that seemed right to them When they heard us testify that Peter James and John appeared and restored priesthood they knew that would have to have happened And the Holy Spirit which they also recognized told them it was true I realized sometime last night or early this morning that they recognized the truth that this is the Church of Jesus Christ in large part because they had always remembered him Every day they had gathered to read about him and his words and so they remembered him And after they were baptized they were ready to follow the living prophet because they knew the Savior always speaks to his prophets to bless his people I will keep my covenant to take his name upon me and always remember him And I will go wherever I am sent to teach of him and offer the ordinances by which we take his name upon us and promise that we will always remember him and keep his commandments And if they accept that invitation they will know what I know God our Father lives His Son Jesus the Christ did the will of the Father and atoned for all of our sins Because of him we will be resurrected Because of his atonement we may be exalted The Lord sent heavenly messengers to confer keys on his prophet Joseph Smith The Lord has called his prophet today Gordon B Hinckley The Savior will speak to us and all the world through him And if those who hear will take the Savior s name upon them and always remember him and keep his commandments they will finally come to him and he will take them home to his Father and our Father where we may live forever in families I testify that is true in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
You talk with people every day who say that God does not exist or is far far away A woman sat next to me on a plane I spoke to her She strained to understand me When she spoke her accent almost overpowered her English In answer to my question she told me that she was returning to the place of her birth She said that the occasion which drew her was a religious observance of the death of her father who died many years ago She had made the flight on the third the seventh the thirteenth and the seventeenth anniversaries of his death And now she was going again I told her that I admired her devotion to her father She said quietly that she believed in the veneration of her ancestors I asked her if her family had attended church She smiled and said No only go to church when someone dies I asked her if she believed in a god She said Yes I asked her if she thought he was close by She said No If we should need him we would say come here and she made a beckoning sign with her hand I asked her who she believed God was Her soft tentative answer was Well he is like one of our distant ancestors She needed to hear the words you have heard spoken here Jesus Christ the fall of Adam the Atonement the Resurrection repentance eternal life and the pure love of God But I realized those words would not touch her I remembered and understood the power of what Elder Spencer W Kimball wrote in the beginning of his book The Miracle of Forgiveness You may recall this warning This book presupposes a belief in God and in life s high purpose Without God repentance would have little meaning and forgiveness would be both unnecessary and unreal If there were no God life would indeed be meaningless we might find justification in an urge to live only for today to eat drink and be merry to dissipate to satisfy every worldly desire If there were no God there would be no redemption no resurrection no eternities to anticipate and consequently no hope Spencer W Kimball The Miracle of Forgiveness Salt Lake City Bookcraft 1969 pp 3 4 President Kimball s words made me think not how different that woman was from me but how much we were alike God is our ancestor not distant but close He is the Father of our spirits we are his children But like that woman we all at times feel far removed from him Like her if we are to have the words of the gospel of Jesus Christ touch us then we must believe in God We must want to be with him And we must sense our need to be purified to be with him again The day will come when we will see him again President Benson described it this way Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar his face is to us Jesus Christ Gifts and Expectations in Speeches of the Year 1974 Provo Brigham Young University Press 1975 p 313 While what President Benson said will be true in the future we need to feel now that God knows us and loves us as individuals There are times you have felt the closeness of God your Father and that you are his child Those times can come more often There is a simple way to think about it If you want to stay close to someone who has been dear to you but from whom you are separated you know how to do it You would find a way to speak to them you would listen to them and you would discover ways to do things for each other The more often that happened the longer it went on the deeper would be the bond of affection If much time passed without the speaking the listening and the doing the bond would weaken God is perfect and omnipotent and you and I are mortal But he is our Father he loves us and he offers the same opportunity to draw closer to him as would a loving friend And you will do it in much the same way speaking listening and doing Our Heavenly Father has not only invited us to speak to him he has commanded it And as he has always done when he commands he promises too In the nineteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says to you and me Pray always and I will pour out my Spirit upon you and great shall be your blessing yea even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof Behold canst thou read this without rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for gladness Or canst thou run about longer as a blind guide Or canst thou be humble and meek and conduct thyself wisely before me Yea come unto me thy Savior Amen D C 19 38 41 In that scripture and in others it is clear how often we should speak to God regularly in words continually in feelings When the Savior appeared among the people on this continent after his resurrection he taught them how to pray He used the words Pray always That doesn t mean now and then It doesn t mean to pray only when you feel like it Listen to what he said to them Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you Verily verily I say unto you ye must watch and pray always lest ye be tempted by the devil and ye be led away captive by him And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name Behold I am the light I have set an example for you 3 Ne 18 14 16 Now you and I need to listen with great care When you heard the scripture I just recited you heard the words of Christ I testify that is true Jesus Christ speaks the words of the Father You can read the scriptures listen and then hear God s answers to you There is another way to listen to God Many of you will have heard answers to your prayers today I bear testimony that you have in this conference heard the voices of Apostles and prophets of the Lord Jesus Christ The Lord said this of them as they speak by his direction What I the Lord have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not myself and though the heavens and the earth pass away my word shall not pass away but shall all be fulfilled whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same For behold and lo the Lord is God and the Spirit beareth record and the record is true and the truth abideth forever and ever Amen D C 1 38 39 It is the Spirit which will bear record to your heart as you read the scriptures as you hear the Lord s authorized servants and as God speaks directly to your heart You can listen and hear if you believe that the scriptures are accurate when they describe the Holy Ghost this way Yea thus saith the still small voice which whispereth through and pierceth all things and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest D C 85 6 Now I testify it is a small voice It whispers not shouts And so you must be very quiet inside That is why you may wisely fast when you want to listen And that is why you will listen best when you feel Father thy will not mine be done You will have a feeling of I want what you want Then the still small voice will seem as if it pierces you It may make your bones to quake More often it will make your heart burn within you again softly but with a burning which will lift and reassure You will act after you have listened because when you hear his voice by the Spirit you will always feel that you are impelled to do something You mustn t be surprised if the instruction seems accompanied with what you feel as a rebuke You might prefer that God simply tell you how well you are doing But he loves you wants you to be with him and knows you must have a mighty change in your heart through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ humble repentance and the making and keeping of sacred covenants That s why the Proverbs record this My son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth Prov 3 11 12 As you have listened to God s servants here you have felt pricked in your heart to do something You could react with a hard heart Why is an imperfect man telling me to repent Or you could hear instead the loving invitation of your Heavenly Father who delighted in you when you were with him and delights in the prospect that you will accept his loving correction You will find something else in the pattern of correction you have felt Do you notice how much of it is an urging to do something for someone else That is no surprise God loves his children They have great needs Everything belongs to God so there is not much you can give him after you have given him a repentant heart But you can give kindness to his children If you were my earthly friend you would win my heart by being kind to my children God loves his children more than any earthly parent so think what your kindness to his children means to him With all you will do for your Heavenly Father if you pray and listen and then obey him all your days you will still find him more generous than you can ever be Here is how King Benjamin described your problem of exchanging acts of kindness with God And he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you for which if ye do he doth immediately bless you and therefore he hath paid you And ye are still indebted unto him and are and will be forever and ever therefore of what have ye to boast Mosiah 2 24 Now even the Savior of the world when he was on the cross felt his Father far from him You will have moments perhaps long moments of feelings of separation But you know the way to draw closer to God King Benjamin taught us the way I say unto you I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts that ye are not found on the left hand of God but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called and also the name by which he shall call you For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served and who is a stranger unto him and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart Mosiah 5 12 13 Now you will still be startled as President Benson said you would be to realize how familiar the face of our Heavenly Father is But when you see him you will know his voice because you will have prayed listened obeyed and come to share the thoughts and intents of his heart You will have drawn nearer to him I pray that we will In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Many of you have had the same experience I have had And if you haven t you will you will go to a hospital or to a house to comfort someone and instead they comfort you Or you try to encourage someone who seems to you to have so little and yet they will express gratitude for things you take for granted To find gratitude and generosity when you could reasonably find hurt and resentment will surprise you It will be so surprising because you will see so much of the opposite people who have much more than others yet who react with anger when one advantage is lost or with resentment when an added gift is denied A poem describes that contrast it is called How Different Some murmur when the sky is clearAnd wholly bright to view If one small speck of dark appearIn their great heaven of blue And some with thankful love are filled If but one streak of light One ray of God s good mercy gildThe darkness of their night You and I would like to know how to control our wants and increase our gratitude and generosity We are going to need that change Someday in our families and as a people we will live as one seeking each other s good You know from studying Church history that we have tried to live as one in a variety of settings A story from one of those tries in Orderville Utah gives us a clue as to why it is so hard Orderville was founded in 1870 and 1871 by people who wanted to live the united order in 1875 they began the order They built housing units in a square with a common dining hall They built a storehouse shoe shop bakery blacksmith shop tannery schoolhouse sheep shed and woolen factory They grew and made nearly everything they needed from soap to trousers They had carpenters midwives teachers artists and musicians They produced enough surplus that they could sell it in neighboring towns for cash with that they built up a capital fund to buy more land and equipment The population rose to seven hundred people One hundred and fifty of them gave Orderville a special advantage they had come to Orderville from the mission on the Muddy River where they had nearly starved When those who had been called to the Muddy were released they were in near destitution Twenty four of those families went to Long Valley founded Orderville and pledged all they had to the Lord They didn t have much but their poverty may have been their greatest contribution Their having almost nothing provided a basis for future comparison that might have guaranteed gratitude any food or clothing or housing that came to them in Orderville would be treasure compared to their privation on the Muddy mission But time passed the railroad came and a mining boom put cash in the hands of people in the neighboring towns They could buy imported clothes and they did The people in Orderville were living better than they had in years but the memory of poverty on the Muddy had faded They now focused on what was in the next town And so they felt old fashioned and deprived One ingenious boy acted on the discontent he felt when he was denied a new pair of pants from the Orderville factory because his were not worn out yet He secretly gathered the docked lambs tails from the spring crop He sheared the wool from them and stored it in sacks Then when he was sent with a load of wool to sell in Nephi he took his sacks along and exchanged them for a pair of store pants He created a sensation when he wore the new style pants to the next dance The president of the order asked him what he had done The boy gave an honest answer So they called him into a meeting and told him to bring the pants They commended him for his initiative pointed out that the pants really belonged to the order and took them But they told him this the pants would be taken apart used as a pattern and henceforth Orderville pants would have the new store bought style And he would get the first pair That did not quite end the pants rebellion Orders for new pants soon swamped the tailoring department When the orders were denied because pants weren t yet worn out boys began slipping into the shed where the grinding wheel was housed Soon pants began to wear out quickly The elders gave in sent a load of wool out to trade for cloth and the new style pants were produced for everyone You know that isn t a happy ending There were many challenges Orderville faced in the ten years they lived the order there One of them they never really conquered It was the problem of not remembering That is a problem we must solve too Just as they forgot poverty on the Muddy we so easily forget that we came into life with nothing Whatever we get soon seems our natural right not a gift And we forget the giver Then our gaze shifts from what we have been given to what we don t have yet God has used one method over and over to help with that problem of remembering A group of people in the Book of Mormon record lost their flocks their herds and their fields of grain Some lost their lives And then the survivors remembered In Alma it says And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty Alma 4 3 Confronting death and difficulty does return memory and therefore gratitude to righteous people as well as the wicked But there must be another way to remember one we can choose There is A servant of God named King Benjamin taught it to his people and to us He taught them that none of us is above another because we are all dust to which God has given life and then sustained it He described a fact which is true for every human being unforgiven sin will bring us unending torment And he described the gift we all have been offered those whose faith in Jesus Christ leads them to repentance and forgiveness will live in never ending happiness King Benjamin s teaching had a miraculous effect Gratitude for what they had led to faith unto repentance That led to forgiveness That produced new gratitude And then King Benjamin taught that if we can remember and so remain grateful we will retain a remission of our sins through all the losses and the gains of life He taught it this way And again I say unto you as I have said before that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love and have received a remission of your sins which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls even so I would that ye should remember and always retain in remembrance the greatness of God and your own nothingness and his goodness and long suffering towards you unworthy creatures and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility calling on the name of the Lord daily and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come which was spoken by the mouth of the angel And behold I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice and be filled with the love of God and always retain a remission of your sins and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you or in the knowledge of that which is just and true Mosiah 4 11 12 How can you and I remember always the goodness of God that we can retain a remission of our sins The Apostle John recorded what the Savior taught us of a gift of remembrance which comes through the gift of the Holy Ghost But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you John 14 26 The Holy Ghost brings back memories of what God has taught us And one of the ways God teaches us is with his blessings and so if we choose to exercise faith the Holy Ghost will bring God s kindnesses to our remembrance You could test that in prayer today You could follow the command Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things D C 59 7 President Benson suggested prayer as a time to do that He said The Prophet Joseph said at one time that one of the greatest sins of which the Latter day Saints would be guilty is the sin of ingratitude I presume most of us have not thought of that as a great sin There is a great tendency for us in our prayers and in our pleadings with the Lord to ask for additional blessings But sometimes I feel we need to devote more of our prayers to expressions of gratitude and thanksgiving for blessings already received We enjoy so much God Family Country Salt Lake City Deseret Book Co 1974 p 199 You could have an experience with the gift of the Holy Ghost today You could begin a private prayer with thanks You could start to count your blessings and then pause for a moment If you exercise faith and with the gift of the Holy Ghost you will find that memories of other blessings will flood into your mind If you begin to express gratitude for each of them your prayer may take a little longer than usual Remembrance will come And so will gratitude You could try the same thing as you write an entry in your book of remembrance The Holy Ghost has helped with that since the beginning of time You remember in the record of Moses it says And a book of remembrance was kept in the which was recorded in the language of Adam for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration Moses 6 5 President Spencer W Kimball described that process of inspired writing Those who keep a book of remembrance are more likely to keep the Lord in remembrance in their daily lives Journals are a way of counting our blessings and of leaving an inventory of these blessings for our posterity The Teachings of Spencer W Kimball ed Edward L Kimball Salt Lake City Bookcraft 1982 p 349 As you start to write you could ask yourself How did God bless me today If you do that long enough and with faith you will find yourself remembering blessings And sometimes you will have gifts brought to your mind which you failed to notice during the day but which you will then know were a touch of God s hand in your life You can choose to remember the greatest gift of all Next week you can go to a meeting where the sacrament is administered You will hear the words Always remember him You can pledge to do that and the Holy Ghost will help you President Marion G Romney talked about the gift we will be helped to remember He said We should be thankful and express appreciation for all favors received and surely we receive many The chief objects of our gratitude however should be and are God our Heavenly Father and his son Jesus Christ our Lord and Redeemer To the Lord Jesus we owe an undying debt of gratitude for he bought us with a great price It is impossible for us weak mortals as we are to fully comprehend and appreciate the sufferings he endured on the cross that he might gain for us the victory over death Ensign June 1974 p 3 I bear you my testimony that Jesus is the Christ that he atoned for our sins and that the keys which unlock the doors of eternal life were restored to the Prophet Joseph Smith and are on the earth today I bear testimony that President Ezra Taft Benson now holds those keys Not long ago a man asked me Does your church still believe that when Christ comes you will be living as one the way they did in the city of Enoch He put a spin on the word still as if we might not believe such a thing anymore I said Yes we do And then he said You are the people who could do it I do not know why he thought that but I know why he was right He was right because this is the kingdom of God Your baptism for the remission of sins your receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost were offered by priesthood servants recognized by God And so the remembrance King Benjamin urged upon us can be ours Remembrance is the seed of gratitude which is the seed of generosity Gratitude for the remission of sins is the seed of charity the pure love of Christ And so God has made possible for you and me this blessing a change in our very natures And the remission of sins bringeth meekness and lowliness of heart and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love which love endureth by diligence unto prayer until the end shall come when all the saints shall dwell with God Moro 8 26 I pray that we may make the simple choices which will lead us there to dwell with Him And I pray that we will remember and be grateful for the gift of the Atonement and the gift of the Holy Ghost which make that journey possible In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
From the islands of the Pacific to the highlands of South America I ve seen boys working to turn dreams into reality In fact I ve seen it so often that it merges into one image one picture It s of a small boy maybe nine or ten in shorts barefoot and with a torn shirt He s on a patch of dirt alone and he s looking down at a white and black checkered ball He takes a step toward it his leg swings through and the ball shoots off about seven feet above the ground where it might zip past a goalie into the net except there s no goalie and no net there s just the boy and the ball And then he runs to the ball puts it in place with his foot and kicks it And he does it over and over again You don t know where he lives but you know that he ll take the ball home with him and that more than likely he keeps it near the place he sleeps He sees it when he gets up and when he goes to bed He may even dream about that ball shooting toward the goal You know that because you ve done something like it yourself It may have been a basketball I can remember looking down at the ball in my hands on one freezing winter day and seeing my bloody fingerprints on the ball I d been outside so long that the cold had cracked the skin on my fingertips but my mind and my eye were on the orange rim I can still remember it including the chipped paint on the front edge of the rim where you d lock your eye and know the ball would fall just past that spot into the dirt stained net I can still remember the mark on the driveway I d dribble to and know I was at the top of the key I d spin and jump for that last second shot with the score tied And I d do it again and again sometimes for hours feeling neither time nor the cold You may have learned endurance playing a trumpet or throwing a football or riding a bucking horse or drawing a picture But you learned what we all did Effort only now and then didn t take you far The dreams that turned into reality stuck with you nearly all the time You worked at them either in fact or in your thoughts every day and almost every hour It shouldn t surprise us then that the Lord has said to you and to me Watch over the church always and be with and strengthen them D C 20 53 God loves us and he intends for us to become like him He doesn t ask us now to worry about all his children in all the world as he does Instead he begins with a call to watch over just a few families just a few people But he knows that to visit thirty minutes every month with the same lesson for every family would never produce the progress he wants for us And so he commands Watch over them always and be with and strengthen them You can t be with them twenty four hours a day That would be always wouldn t it But they can be in your heart always If you ll think about the families you visit those of you who are blessed to be called home teachers you know the help they need is beyond your casual effort In my experience I ve been assigned to watch over people who struggled with divorce with financial ruin with children who would not respond to all that parents had done or with disease that would not respond to all that faith and medicine could do I ve gone to a home where little twin girls were sent to the screen door to tell us that Mommy and Daddy were sleeping and couldn t we come another time I knew in my heart that effort now and then wasn t enough that going out home teaching or even giving a good lesson wouldn t do it God called us to watch over and help people in all their struggles for physical and spiritual well being He called us to help by the Spirit He called us to teach by the Spirit He called us to live what we teach He called us to bear testimony He called us to love them Now he didn t make it that hard just to test you He gave you so high a calling because he loves you He wants you home again and to get there you have to become like him So he gives you a calling that can only be done with persistence and endurance Let s talk tonight as if you and I were companions I know we may not have gotten together often to prepare but let s do it tonight Let s imagine that you and I are at my house You ve come over for a few minutes and we re sitting at my kitchen table We won t talk about home teaching visits or lessons first We ll talk about our families for a while We ll find that some of them are struggling And that will humble us knowing that the Lord is counting on us We might talk about what we know the bishop and the Relief Society and some neighbors are doing to help And we might talk about some things we have done and could do Then we ll get around to talking about one family and what we might teach them I ll push the April Ensign across the table to you opened to the First Presidency message from President Benson You look down and see the title Seek the Spirit of the Lord That looks like the perfect lesson doesn t it There s only the mom and dad at home They worry about her health problems wondering if they re doing all they can and should On top of that they probably aren t sleeping much because of their son He s still in the same town but he s living with his friends He won t be there when we call but he ll be in their minds and what he s doing and not doing will be tearing at their hearts They ll be wondering what they can do for him If people ever wanted and needed the Spirit of the Lord these folks do Let s agree that we ll both prepare the lesson But I think they have such respect for you that you ought to take the lead We can t do them any good unless the Holy Ghost is with us so I guess we d better do more than prepare the lesson We d better prepare ourselves First the Holy Ghost can t be with us unless we re clean I admire the way you try to watch what you say and do even what you think I guess when the Lord tells us to watch over the Church that means watching over ourselves too Let s read this quotation from President George Q Cannon I keep handy And let s agree that we ll try to follow it Some people have an idea that because they have entered the waters of baptism and repented of their sins then that is an end of it What a mistake We need to have this spirit of repentance continually we need to pray to God to show us our conduct every day Every night before we retire to rest we should review the thoughts words and acts of the day and then repent of everything we have done that is wrong or that has grieved the Holy Spirit Live this way every day and endeavor to progress every day Gospel Truth Jerreld L Newquist ed Salt Lake City Deseret Book Co 1987 p 129 Second let s pray both for forgiveness and to get answers about what to do for the family It would help if when we go we tell them that the Holy Ghost can guide them it has already guided us to do something for them If we pray and then feel that prompting and act on it what we do may be more important than anything we say Maybe our finding out how to help them will lead them to find out what more they can do for their son Let s agree that we ll include both the parents and their children in our personal prayers and we ll plead for the Holy Ghost to help us teach You remember the promise And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach D C 42 14 That really fits us doesn t it Third we re going to be teaching a gospel principle so we d better study and ponder the scriptures You remember that the Lord said Teach the principles of my gospel which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon in the which is the fulness of the gospel D C 42 12 I know you ve been reading the Book of Mormon regularly So have I Why don t we think about our family and the gifts of the Spirit while we read If we do I m sure that we ll understand and feel some things that are new to us And we ll teach and bear testimony in their home with more power It won t hurt to bear testimony from our own experience that we felt the Spirit while we read the scriptures Then they may try reading and pondering If they do they ll get the prompting of the Holy Ghost for themselves And that will help them more than just feeling it when we re there Then we ll have a prayer together before you leave In the next day or two we may stop by the house to do something for the family before we get there for a lesson The night we teach them things will seem about as they have before with a few exceptions An idea and a scripture will come into your mind as you teach You ll bear testimony of the Savior with more feeling Perhaps we will both find our hearts drawn out to the people more And they may linger at the door a little longer than usual as we go Maybe only some of that will happen But that won t discourage us We thought it would take repeated steady effort The desire of our hearts is to help others taste the fruit of the gospel We know it won t come quickly or easily after a single effort for them or for us But in that visit or in one that will come later you will feel a warmth in your heart and truth will come into your mind And that will bring you joy It may go away but you will remember it Then you will be able to imagine what it would be like to have the Holy Ghost for your constant companion in this life and to feel the love and approval of the Savior and your Father in Heaven for eternity Alma knew what having that desire in our hearts and visualizing it with faith would mean to us It would keep us going when the going was hard Here s what he said And thus if ye will not nourish the word looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life But if ye will nourish the word yea nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow by your faith with great diligence and with patience looking forward to the fruit thereof it shall take root and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life Alma 32 40 41 By the power of the Holy Ghost and with the eye of faith we have glimpsed and we can look forward to the fruit of the gospel That is the desire of our hearts And wanting it will give us the power to keep going with great diligence and patience The little boy in my memory keeps kicking that ball over and over again I can t see a goalpost or a goalie I can t hear the roar of the crowd But in his mind he can And so he kicks the ball over and over again I pray that we will take the great opportunity God has given us to prepare ourselves He has trusted us as watchmen of the souls of his children He has given us a way to look forward to the fruit of the gospel by giving us a calling that requires our whole hearts As the boy s dreams of kicking the winning goal draw him back to persistent practice with that ball so our vision of the fruits of the gospel will draw us back to persistent repentance and prayer and study and service I pray that the Lord may say of us as Alma said of his son Shiblon And now my son I trust that I shall have great joy in you because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments for blessed is he that endureth to the end Alma 38 2 I bear testimony that in time and in eternity God will bless our steadiness as we invite his children to come unto Christ In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
At the close of the last general conference President Benson said this I bless you with increased understanding of the Book of Mormon I promise you that from this moment forward if we will daily sup from its pages and abide by its precepts God will pour out upon each child of Zion and the Church a blessing hitherto unknown Ensign May 1986 p 78 I bear my testimony that I have been blessed as He promised and I have seen new blessings come to people I love I am grateful that God honors the promises he makes through his prophet Even as I feel that gratitude I think of those whose hearts ache over promises yet unfulfilled Tonight or tomorrow many of us will pray with real intent and perhaps with tears over someone whose happiness would bring us happiness who has been promised all the blessings of peace that come with baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost and yet who counts the promises worthless None of us is immune because all of us have circles of love large enough to include such people My heart is drawn especially to those asking the question we all have asked How can I be sure I have done all I can to help Fifty years ago in October conference President J Reuben Clark Jr of the First Presidency gave this answer which I carry copied on a card It is my hope and my belief that the Lord never permits the light of faith wholly to be extinguished in any human heart however faint the light may glow The Lord has provided that there shall still be there a spark which with teaching with the spirit of righteousness with love with tenderness with example with living the Gospel shall brighten and glow again however darkened the mind may have been And if we shall fail so to reach those among us of our own whose faith has dwindled low we shall fail in one of the main things which the Lord expects at our hands in Conference Report Oct 1936 p 114 That lovely metaphor of a spark a spark of faith gives me confidence President Clark pictured the spark nearly hidden almost smothered by the ashes of transgression It may be so small that the person can t feel its warmth The heart may be hardened Even the Holy Spirit may have been forced to withdraw But the spark still lives and glows and may be fanned to flame President Clark also suggested what we can do He did not suggest a single approach to reach all people But he described what every effort that succeeds in fanning the spark will include Teaching is first But what should we teach Suppose time and opportunity are scarce as they generally are with people who don t think they need your teaching If you had the gift and the chance to teach only one thing what would it be For me the answer is illustrated in the success of a great man whose heart ached over someone he loved His name was Alma and his son Alma went about trying to destroy the true Church You remember that in response to the prayers of his father and of faithful members of the Church God sent an angel to rebuke the son The rebuke brought young Alma such remorse that he would have been destroyed had he not remembered his father s teaching He described it this way And now for three days and for three nights was I racked even with the pains of a damned soul And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins behold I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ a Son of God to atone for the sins of the world Now as my mind caught hold upon this thought I cried within my heart O Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me who am in the gall of bitterness and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death Alma 36 16 18 Because his father had taught him that the Savior was his only source of hope Alma began the process which took him to full repentance If I had the chance to teach one thing it would be what it means and how it feels to exercise faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance To do it I would try to take the person I loved on a journey from when we were with a loving Father in Heaven to when we can go home to him again We would see the fall of Adam and Eve and feel its effects on us We would go to Bethlehem and rejoice at the birth of the Son of God and to the Garden and to Golgotha as our hearts break at the transcendent gift of the Atonement And we would go to the open tomb and to Galilee and to this hemisphere to feel hope in keeping the commandments of the Risen Lord Then we would go to a grove in New York to watch the boy Joseph Smith talk with God the Father and his resurrected Son to begin the errand that restored the ordinances of the gospel which can lead us home again President Clark understood that a person in whom faith is an ember won t receive even great teaching unless his heart is softened And so he said that we must touch the person with the spirit of righteousness with love and with tenderness Now you and I might rightly feel that what he asks is nearly superhuman In our efforts to invite others back we have felt rejection and even ridicule We may feel fatigue frustration and sometimes guilt How then can we keep reaching out in a spirit of righteousness with love and tenderness The best answer I know comes from another wonderful father His name was Mormon He wrote a letter to his son Moroni in a time when they met not only rejection but unbridled hatred and faced not only frustration but almost certain failure Mormon wanted Moroni to meet even such a test with love and tenderness and the spirit of righteousness He gave a formula the same one given by true prophets in all ages It has always worked The promise is sure Here it is from Mormon s letter And the first fruits of repentance is baptism and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins And the remission of sins bringeth meekness and lowliness of heart and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love which love endureth by diligence unto prayer until the end shall come when all the saints shall dwell with God Moro 8 25 26 If you try to imagine the Savior restoring a lost sheep to the fold won t you picture him cradling it in his arms That tenderness and love Mormon testified to his son is the natural result of the atonement of Jesus Christ operating in our lives Our faith leads us to repentance to the gifts of the Spirit and from that to the perfect love which the Master Shepherd has and knows we must have to serve him The effects of the Atonement in our lives can also produce in us the example those we love will need I learned again the other night the example we need to be I was chatting with my wife at the end of a long day Three of our children were in the room listening I turned and noticed that one of them was watching me and watching my face intently And then he asked me softly Why are you unhappy I tried to give a reason for my furrowed brow but I realized later that he could well have been asking this deeper question Can I see in you the hope for peace in this life that Jesus promised To turn my thoughts from what darkened my look to what would brighten it I went to another letter from Mormon to his son Both Mormon and Moroni were facing days of difficulty that make my challenges pale Mormon knew his son might be overcome with gloom and foreboding so he told him the perfect antidote He told him that he could choose by what he put in his mind to become an example of hope Here is what he wrote My son be faithful in Christ and may not the things which I have written grieve thee to weigh thee down unto death but may Christ lift thee up and may his sufferings and death and the showing his body unto our fathers and his mercy and long suffering and the hope of his glory and of eternal life rest in your mind forever Moro 9 25 What we can do to help teaching and doing it with the spirit of righteousness with love with tenderness with example centers on the Savior and his atonement That is what we would teach The Atonement working in our lives will produce in us the love and tenderness we need And by remembering Him and His gift which we promise to do as we take the sacrament each week we can put a light of hope in our faces which those we love need so much to see President Clark reminded us at the end of his suggestions that there is and always will be free agency The spark won t glow brighter until the person tries living the gospel That is why we hope so much that those we love will be called and will fulfill some assignment however small After their choice to serve others to sacrifice to try the commandments with promise the spark of faith ignites Even after we have done all we can do that choice whether to act on what faith they have must be theirs I bear my testimony that God lives Jesus is the Christ and in this dispensation through prophets from Joseph Smith to Ezra Taft Benson He has given the power to offer again the full blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ I pray that we may never cease to offer the opportunity to choose those blessings to those in whom the spark of faith may yet be fanned to flame In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On Friday morning President Hinckley called me to serve as a counselor to Bishop Hales in the Presiding Bishopric I am grateful for the call and for the knowledge that it is the Savior who makes such calls through his servants in his Church And I am grateful for your sustaining vote which surely must stem from your conviction that God issued that call During the meetings yesterday I was overwhelmed in two ways by the reaction of the General Authorities First they expressed love and confidence which I deeply appreciate But second I felt in addition to that same love from Bishops Brown Peterson and Clarke an added expression of almost solicitude I realized they knew what was ahead of me and I sensed they might know the growing feeling in my heart that I was overwhelmed by the task ahead As that feeling increased I began to think more and more of me But then I remembered that in the past few weeks a deacon has come home with the rolls to announce he was the new quorum secretary a teacher has been called to preside in his quorum a mother has been called to be a counselor in a Relief Society presidency and a nineteen year old boy has been called to go to a new city with a new missionary companion To each of them and to each of you fear of failure might try to poke its head in as it has with me Something happened to me yesterday afternoon that I found of great help to me and it may be of help to you Since that moment the fear has gone It was when Bishop Hales was speaking in conference He mentioned that we had known each other since boyhood and as he did a memory was replayed in my mind It was of a hotel ballroom in New Brunswick New Jersey Bishop Hales was likely not there since he lived in what seemed to us the well established stake in New York We were in the New Jersey District a single district that covered the whole state The Princeton Branch met in my parents dining room Dad was the branch president Mother was both the pianist and chorister which is hard to do if you think about it There was not another family in the branch with children so my brother Ted was the Aaronic Priesthood and my brother Harden and I were all there were of Primary and junior Sunday School The congregations were young students who happened to be there like Jim Fletcher and Neil Zundle and a few older converts none with spouses that were members There was no building no gym no stake center and so we traveled to a hotel ballroom for what must have been a district conference I was sitting on a folding chair somewhere near the back next to my mother I must have been very young because I can remember putting my legs through the back of the chair and sitting aft instead of forward But then I remember hearing something a man s voice from the pulpit I turned around and looked I still remember that the speaker was at a rostrum set on wooden risers There was a tall window behind him He was the priesthood visitor I don t know who he was but he was tall and bald and he seemed very old to me He must have been talking about the Savior or the Prophet Joseph or both because that was all that I remember much of hearing in those days But as he spoke I knew that what he said came from God and that it was true and it burned in my heart That was before scholars told me how hard it was to know I just knew of certainty I knew it was true And when I listened to Bishop Hales yesterday I knew that what he was saying was from God and that it was true and then the fear left You can have that same confidence not of yourself but from God He lives and he communicates with his children This is the Church of Jesus Christ and he leads it No assignment in it need ever overwhelm you if you know that and listen for the Master s voice Now I can hear the young deacons saying Well now that may be fine for you but surely you don t think that s going to help me in my assignment down here in this deacons quorum Oh yes I do Between being a high councilor and a member of the General Board of the Sunday School I was a deacons quorum adviser A boy the president presided in the meetings and I taught the lessons out of the scriptures and out of the manual I stayed very close to the lessons as they were outlined I remember one boy in the quorum had to miss a few meetings and so he sent his brother to the class with a tape recorder His brother recorded our meeting and took it home It happened more than once When the deacon came back I asked him why I don t remember his words but I remember that it was clear he knew what I knew God was trying to speak to that deacons quorum The boy wasn t anxious to have a tape recording to hear me he was trying to hear God He knew where to listen and how to hear He d read the scriptures for us in class and I knew he knew them and loved them And so even when I wasn t teaching very well by the power of the Holy Ghost and from knowing the Master s voice in the scriptures he could hear what he needed to hear The memory of that black recorder with its tape turning will always remind me of the scripture which says He that hath ears to hear let him hear Matt 11 15 I spoke at his funeral just a few years later He lived about as many years as the Prophet Joseph had lived when he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ in the grove My deacon hadn t seen a vision but he had heard the voice of God through his servants in a deacons quorum He wanted to hear he knew how and he had the faith he could Like the boy prophet Joseph he knew the heavens were open You and I can take confidence in that assurance If you and I will study the scriptures and pray and tune our hearts and ears we will hear the voice of God in the voice of the people that he has sent to teach and guide us and direct us I heard it yesterday as I listened to Bishop Hales and I heard it last evening in the priesthood session as I listened to the recorded voice of President Kimball a prophet of God You and I can take confidence in that assurance for the Church itself However large the kingdom will grow and it will fill the earth you will not ever feel lost or forgotten and you need never feel overwhelmed God will call people to care about you and to teach you And if you will listen and hear the voice of God the kingdom will roll forth to its appointed place ready for the coming of the Master None of us can see now all the wonders of technology and organization and buildings that God may give us but you just you hearing the voice of God through your teacher and leader will always be at its heart I m grateful for the gift given to me of ears to hear One of my great grandfathers John Bennion walked or rode his horse from over Jordan to this place to hear his name called out to go on a mission to Dixie His journal doesn t say much except just that the next day he prepared to go and he went His assignment was to be a sheepherder In his journal there is a record of an evening in which he met with Erastus Snow He said another man was in the room his name was Henry Eyring And somewhere in St George that night was Bishop Miles Romney They talked about sheep And you might have thought they were talking about something temporal But not to those men because they knew they were God s sheep and they knew they were for God s people And they knew how to listen and they knew how to do what they heard John Bennion went on another mission to Wales and back again to this valley Henry Eyring went on to Colonia Juarez as Miles Romney did And they left for me a tradition which I deeply appreciate They were the yeomen of the Church the soldiers of the Church and my great grandfathers You can t find in their journals records of the positions they held just of the instructions they heard and knew were from God and followed I m grateful to my parents who handed me that heritage undiminished I m grateful to my wife who more than once has heard when I did not and gently said Would you pray about it If my sons and daughters will listen to her and hear through her what God has in mind for them we will pass the heritage on again God lives Jesus is the Christ Joseph Smith in fact saw God and His Son and received all the keys of the priesthood And President Kimball holds them today I testify that God loves his children and can tell us what is true I pray that we all may have ears to hear that he may guide us I pray that I may serve you and him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
