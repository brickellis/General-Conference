Thank you very much President for such a wonderful opening Brothers and sisters 215 years ago a little boy was born to Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith in Vermont in a region known as New England in the northeastern United States Joseph and Lucy Mack believed in Jesus Christ studied the holy scriptures sincerely prayed and walked with faith in God They named their new baby son Joseph Smith Jr Of the Smith family Brigham Young said The Lord had his eye upon Joseph Smith and upon his father and upon his father s father and upon their progenitors clear back to Abraham and from Abraham to the flood from the flood to Enoch and from Enoch to Adam He has watched that family and that blood as it has circulated from its fountain to the birth of that man Joseph Smith was foreordained in eternity 1Beloved by his family Joseph Jr was particularly close to his older brother Hyrum who was nearly six years of age when Joseph was born Last October I sat by the hearthstone that was in the small Smith home in Sharon Vermont where Joseph was born I felt Hyrum s love for Joseph and thought of him holding his baby brother in his arms and teaching him how to walk Father and Mother Smith experienced personal setbacks forcing them to move their family numerous times before finally giving up on New England and making the courageous decision to move farther west to New York State Because the family was united they survived these challenges and together faced the daunting task of starting over again on a hundred acre 0 4 km2 wooded tract of land in Manchester near Palmyra New York I am not sure that many of us realize the physical and emotional challenges that starting over presented the Smith family clearing land planting orchards and fields building a small log home and other farm structures hiring out as day laborers and making home goods to sell in town By the time the family arrived in western New York the area was ablaze with religious fervor known as the Second Great Awakening During this time of debate and strife among religious parties Joseph experienced a wondrous vision known today as the First Vision We are blessed to have four primary accounts from which I will draw 2Joseph recorded During this time of great religious excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness but though my feelings were deep and often poignant still I kept myself aloof from all these parties though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit Yet so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations that it was impossible for a person young as I was and so unacquainted with men and things to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong 3Joseph turned to the Bible to find answers to his questions and read James 1 5 If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him 4He noted Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart I reflected on it again and again 5Joseph came to realize that the Bible did not contain all the answers to life s questions rather it taught men and women how they could find answers to their questions by communicating directly with God through prayer He added So in accordance with this my determination to ask of God I retired to the woods to make the attempt It was on the morning of a beautiful clear day early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty 6Soon thereafter Joseph said that a pillar of light rested upon me and I saw two Personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air One of them spake unto me calling me by name and said pointing to the other Joseph This is My Beloved Son Hear Him 7The Savior then spoke Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee Go thy way walk in my statutes and keep my commandments Behold I am the Lord of glory I was crucified for the world that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life 8Joseph added No sooner therefore did I get possession of myself so as to be able to speak than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light which of all the sects was right 9He recalled They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom And at the same time I receive d a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me 10Joseph also noted I saw many angels in this vision 11Following this glorious vision Joseph wrote My soul was lled with love and for many days I could rejoice with great joy The Lord was with me 12He emerged from the Sacred Grove to begin his preparation to become a prophet of God Joseph also began to learn what ancient prophets experienced rejection opposition and persecution Joseph recalled sharing what he had seen and heard with one of the ministers who had been active in the religious revival I was greatly surprised at his behavior he treated my communication not only lightly but with great contempt saying it was all of the devil that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days that all such things had ceased with the apostles and that there would never be any more of them I soon found however that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion and was the cause of great persecution which continued to increase and this was common among all the sects all united to persecute me 13Three years later in 1823 the heavens opened again as part of the continuing Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the last days Joseph noted that an angel named Moroni appeared to him and said that God had a work for me to do and that there was a book deposited written upon gold plates that contained the fulness of the everlasting Gospel as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants of the Americas 14Eventually Joseph obtained translated and published the ancient record known today as the Book of Mormon His brother Hyrum who had been his constant supporter especially following his painful life threatening leg operation in 1813 was one of the witnesses of the gold plates He was also one of the six members of the Church of Jesus Christ when it was organized in 1830 During their lives Joseph and Hyrum faced mobs and persecution together For example they languished in the most wretched conditions in the Liberty Jail in Missouri for five months during the cold winter of 1838 39 In April 1839 Joseph wrote his wife Emma describing their situation in Liberty Jail I believe it is now about five months and six days since I have been under the grimace of a guard night and day and within the walls grates and screeching iron doors of a lonesome dark dirty prison We shall be moved from this place at any rate and we are glad of it Let what will become of us we cannot get into a worse hole than this is We shall never cast a lingering wish after Liberty in Clay County Missouri We have enough of it to last forever 15In the face of persecution Hyrum exhibited faith in the Lord s promises including a guarantee to escape his enemies if he so chose In a blessing Hyrum received in 1835 under the hands of Joseph Smith the Lord promised him Thou shalt have power to escape the hand of thine enemies Thy life shall be sought with untiring zeal but thou shalt escape If it please thee and thou desirest thou shalt have the power voluntarily to lay down thy life to glorify God 16In June 1844 Hyrum was presented the choice to live or to lay down his life to glorify God and to seal his testimony with his blood side by side together with his beloved brother Joseph 17A week before the fateful trip to Carthage where they were murdered in cold blood by an armed mob of cowards who had painted their faces to avoid detection Joseph recorded that I advised my brother Hyrum to take his family on the next steamboat and go to Cincinnati I still feel great emotion as I remember Hyrum s reply Joseph I can t leave you 18So Joseph and Hyrum went to Carthage where they became martyrs for Christ s cause and name The official announcement of the martyrdom stated the following Joseph Smith the Prophet and Seer of the Lord has brought forth the Book of Mormon which he translated by the gift and power of God and has been the means of publishing it on two continents has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel which it contained to the four quarters of the earth has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men gathered many thousands of the Latter day Saints founded a great city and left a fame and name that cannot be slain And like most of the Lord s anointed in ancient times Joseph has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood and so has his brother Hyrum In life they were not divided and in death they were not separated 19Following the martyrdom Joseph s and Hyrum s bodies were returned to Nauvoo washed and dressed so the Smith family could see their loved ones Their precious mother recalled I had for a long time braced every nerve roused every energy of my soul and called upon God to strengthen me but when I entered the room and saw my murdered sons extended both at once before my eyes and heard the sobs and groans of my family and the cries from the lips of their wives children brothers and sisters it was too much I sank back crying to the Lord in the agony of my soul My God My God Why hast thou forsaken this family 20At that moment of sorrow and distress she recalled them saying Mother weep not for us we have overcome the world by love 21They had indeed overcome the world Joseph and Hyrum Smith like those faithful Saints described in the book of Revelation came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb and are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them They shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes 22As we celebrate this joyous occasion the 200th anniversary of the First Vision we should always remember the price Joseph and Hyrum Smith paid along with so many other faithful men women and children to establish the Church so you and I could enjoy the many blessings and all of these revealed truths we have today Their faithfulness should never be forgotten I have often wondered why Joseph and Hyrum and their families had to suffer so much It may be that they came to know God through their suffering in ways that could not have happened without it Through it they reflected on Gethsemane and the cross of the Savior As Paul said For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake 23Before his death in 1844 Joseph wrote a spirited letter to the Saints It was a call to action which continues in the Church today Brethren and sisters shall we not go on in so great a cause Go forward and not backward Courage brethren and sisters and on on to the victory Let us therefore as a church and a people and as Latter day Saints offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness 24As we listen to the Spirit during this 200th anniversary celebration this weekend consider what offering you will present to the Lord in righteousness in the coming days Be courageous share it with someone you trust and most important please take the time to do it I know that the Savior is pleased when we present Him an offering from our hearts in righteousness just as He was pleased with the faithful offering of those remarkable brothers Joseph and Hyrum Smith and all other faithful Saints Of this I solemnly testify in the sacred and holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters as October general conference approached last year I prepared my conference talk to highlight the 100th anniversary of the vision of the spirit world given to President Joseph F Smith on October 3 1918 A few days after I had submitted my talk for translation my beloved eternal companion Barbara completed her mortal probation and passed into the spirit world As the days have turned into weeks then months and now a year since Barbara s passing I find myself more fully appreciating this scripture Thou shalt live together in love insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die 1 Barbara and I were blessed to live together in love for 67 years But I have learned in a very real way what it means to weep for the loss of those we love Oh how I love and miss her I suppose most of us fail to fully appreciate what others do for us until they are gone I knew Barbara was always busy but I did not fully understand the constant family Church and community demands upon her time There were daily consecrated efforts repeated thousands of times through the years that kept our family functioning And through it all no one in our family ever heard her raise her voice or say an unkind word Floods of memories have washed over me this past year I have thought about the physically demanding choice she made to be the mother of seven children Being a homemaker was the only career she ever wanted and she was in every aspect a consummate professional Often I have wondered how she kept track of our children and me Meal preparation alone was a truly daunting task not to mention activities such as doing the mountains of laundry our family generated every week and keeping shoes and appropriately sized clothing on the children We all turned to her on a myriad of other issues that were important to us And because they were important to us they were also important to her She was in a word magnificent as a wife as a mother as a friend as a neighbor and as a daughter of God Now that she has moved on I am happy that I chose to sit next to her when I came home from the office during the last few months of her life to hold her hand as we watched the endings of some of her favorite musicals over and over again because Alzheimer s would not allow her to remember that she had seen them just the afternoon before Memories of those special hand holding sessions are now very very precious to me Brothers and sisters please do not miss an opportunity to look into the eyes of your family members with love Children and parents reach out to each other and express your love and appreciation Like me some of you may wake up one day to discover that the time for such important communication has passed Live each day together with hearts filled with gratitude good memories service and much love During this past year I have pondered more intently than ever before about our Heavenly Father s plan In teaching his son Corianton Alma referred to it as the great plan of happiness 2The word that keeps coming to my mind now when I consider the plan is reunion It is a plan designed by our loving Father in Heaven that has at its center the grand and glorious possibilities of family reunion of eternally reuniting husbands and wives parents and children generation upon generation in the household of God That thought brings me comfort and the assurance that I will be with Barbara again Although she physically suffered toward the end of her life her spirit was strong noble and pure She had prepared herself in all things so that when the day comes she can stand before the pleasing bar of God 3 full of confidence and peaceful assurance But here I am in two days 91 years old and I m still wondering Am I ready Am I doing everything I need to do to be able to hold her hand once again The most simple basic certainty of life is this We are all going to die Whether we die old or young easy or hard wealthy or indigent beloved or lonely nobody escapes death A few years ago President Gordon B Hinckley said something that is particularly meaningful about this How sweet is the assurance how comforting is the peace that come from the knowledge that if we marry right and live right our relationship will continue notwithstanding the certainty of death and the passage of time 4I certainly married right Of that there can be no doubt But that isn t enough according to President Hinckley I also have to live right 5Today living right can be a pretty confusing concept especially if you spend much time on social media where any voice can declare real truths or false concepts about God and His plan for His children Thankfully members of the Church have eternally true gospel principles to know how to live so that we might be better prepared when we must die Just a few months before I was born my Apostle grandfather Elder Melvin J Ballard gave a talk that for some people captured the essence of what it means to live right Titled Struggle for the Soul his talk focused on the ongoing battle between our physical bodies and our eternal spirits He said The greatest conflict that any man or woman will ever have will be the battle that is had with self explaining that Satan the enemy of our souls attacks us through the lusts the appetites the ambitions of the flesh 6 So the primary battle is between our divine and spiritual nature and the carnal natural man Brothers and sisters remember we can receive spiritual help through the influence of the Holy Ghost that can teach you all things 7 Help can also come through the power and blessings of the priesthood Now I ask how is this battle going with each one of you President David O McKay said Man s earthly existence is but a test as to whether he will concentrate his efforts his mind his soul upon things which contribute to the comfort and gratification of his physical nature or whether he will make as his life s purpose the acquisition of spiritual qualities 8This battle between our carnal and our spiritual natures isn t a new thing In his final sermon to his people King Benjamin taught that the natural man is an enemy to God and has been from the fall of Adam and will be forever and ever unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord 9The Apostle Paul taught that they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit For to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace 10It seems clear to me that one of the most important things we can learn in this life is how to emphasize our eternal spiritual nature and control our evil desires This should not be that difficult After all our spirit which has been around a lot longer than our physical body has already been successful in choosing righteousness over evil in the premortal realm Before this earth was formed we lived in the spirit world as sons and daughters of Heavenly Parents who loved us and continue to love us now And yes we did have to make life changing decisions and choices in that premortal realm Every person who has ever lived or ever will live on this planet made an essential decision to choose to accept Heavenly Father s plan for our salvation So we all came to earth with a proven track record of a successful spiritual nature and eternal destiny Think about that for a moment This is who you and I really are and who you have always been a son or daughter of God with spiritual roots in eternity and a future overflowing with infinite possibilities You are first foremost and always a spiritual being And so when we choose to put our carnal nature ahead of our spiritual nature we are choosing something that is contrary to our real true authentic spiritual selves Still there s no question that flesh and earthly impulses complicate the decision making With a veil of forgetfulness drawn between the premortal spirit world and this mortal world we can lose sight of our relationship to God and our spiritual nature and our carnal nature can give priority to what we want right now Learning to choose the things of the Spirit over the things of the flesh is one of the primary reasons why this earthly experience is part of Heavenly Father s plan It s also why the plan is built upon the solid sure foundation of the Atonement of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so that our sins including the errors we make when we yield to the flesh can be overcome through constant repentance and we can live spiritually focused Now is the time to control our bodily appetites to comply with the spiritual doctrine of Christ That is why we must not procrastinate the day of our repentance 11Repentance therefore becomes an indispensable weapon in our battle over self Just last general conference President Russell M Nelson referred to this battle and reminded us that when we choose to repent we choose to change We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy the joy of redemption in Him When we choose to repent we choose to become more like Jesus Christ 12Every night as I review my day in prayer with my Father in Heaven I ask to be forgiven if I did anything wrong and promise to try to be better tomorrow I believe this regular daily repentance helps my spirit remind my body who is in charge of me Another resource is the weekly opportunity we all have to refresh ourselves spiritually by partaking of the sacrament in remembrance of the Atonement and the perfect love that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has for us Brothers and sisters I encourage you to slow down a bit and think about where you are now in subjugating your carnal nature and empowering your divine spiritual nature so when the time comes you may pass into the spirit world to a joyful reunion with your loved ones for which I testify and humbly pray in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters it s difficult for me to believe that it was 71 years ago in 1948 that I was a missionary in England and 44 years ago that my wife Barbara and I took our family to Canada when I was the president of the Canada Toronto Mission While serving there in April 1976 I was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy and unexpectedly in 1985 I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Unlike my previous callings which included future releases my release from my calling to the Twelve is not the best option right now however I pray that day will come only after I have finished all the Lord has called me to do In thinking about my last 43 years of service as a General Authority and the privilege I have had to minister to Heavenly Father s children I have come to realize more fully that He wants all of His children to find peace joy and happiness in their lives The prophet Lehi taught Men and women are that they might have joy 1 There are many reasons why peace joy and happiness may elude us in this life including poverty war natural disasters and unexpected setbacks in employment health and family relationships But even though we cannot control those external forces that impact our lives here on earth as we strive to become faithful disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ we can find peace joy and happiness despite the worldly troubles that swirl around us One of my children once said Dad I wonder if I will ever be able to make it I responded All Heavenly Father asks of us is to do the very best we can each day Brothers and sisters do the best you can do day after day and before you know it you will come to realize that your Heavenly Father knows you and that He loves you And when you know that really know it your life will have real purpose and meaning and you will be filled with joy and peace As the Light of the World the Savior said Whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness 2 Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father and there is none other name given whereby we can be saved Wherefore all men and women must take upon them the name which is given of the Father 3The scriptures teach us that Satan desires to lead people into darkness His every effort is to shut out the light and truth of Jesus Christ and His gospel As Lehi taught his children the devil seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself 4 If Heavenly Father s work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of men and women 5 Lucifer s work is to bring to pass the misery and endless woe of God s children Sin and transgression dim the Light of Christ in our lives That is why our quest is to bask in the Light of Christ which brings peace joy and happiness In the last 18 months the Lord has inspired His prophet and the Apostles to implement a number of wonderful adjustments However I worry that the spiritual purposes of these adjustments might become lost in the excitement about the changes themselves Joseph F Smith said The true pure simple gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored We are responsible for maintaining it upon the earth 6 He added that the true pure and simple gospel is the saving doctrines of Christ 7In the Articles of Faith the Prophet Joseph Smith taught that through the Atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel 8 The first principles of the gospel are faith in the Lord Jesus Christ repentance baptism the gift of the Holy Ghost and enduring to the end His brother Hyrum taught Preach them over and over again you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you You can enlarge upon them to comprehend them clearly You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those you teach 9The best ways for us to see the spiritual purposes of the Church are to live the true pure and simple teachings of Christ and also to apply the Savior s two great commandments Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself 10Obedience to those two commandments provides a way to experience more peace and joy When we love and serve the Lord and love and serve our neighbors we will naturally feel more happiness that comes to us in no better way Loving God and loving our neighbors is the doctrinal foundation of ministering home centered Church supported learning Sabbath day spiritual worship and the work of salvation on both sides of the veil supported in the Relief Societies and the elders quorums All of these things are based on the divine commandments to love God and to love our neighbors Can there be anything more basic more fundamental and more simple than that Living the true pure and simple gospel plan will allow us more time to visit the widows widowers orphans lonely sick and poor We will find peace joy and happiness in our life when serving the Lord and our neighbors The Sabbath day adjustments that emphasize home centered Church supported gospel learning and studying are an opportunity to renew our spirit and our devotion to God within the walls of our homes What could possibly be more simple basic and profound Brothers and sisters can you see that learning and teaching the gospel in our families is an important way to find joy and happiness in our lives Speaking of the Sabbath the Savior said For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High 11 He added That thy joy may be full through rejoicing and prayer ye should do these things with thanksgiving with cheerful hearts and countenances and with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance 12Please note some of the key words in this revelation joy rejoicing thanksgiving cheerful hearts glad heart and a cheerful countenance It sounds to me like Sabbath day observance should bring smiles to our faces As we minister in a higher and holier way please consider how essential it is that we greet everyone who comes to our Church meetings especially new members and visitors We should all enjoy singing the hymns and listening carefully to the words of the sacrament prayers with an open heart and mind Testimonies of faith in our fast and testimony meetings are led by a member of the bishopric who shares a brief testimony focused on the plan of happiness and the true pure and simple gospel of Christ All others should follow that example We need to remember that there are other appropriate places to tell stories or share travel adventures As we keep our testimonies simple and focused on the gospel of Christ He will provide spiritual renewal as we share our testimonies with one another Effective ministering is best viewed through the focused lens of loving God and loving our neighbors Simply stated we minister because we love our Heavenly Father and His children Our ministering efforts will be more successful if we keep our ministering simple The most joy comes from the simple things of life so we need to be careful not to think that more needs to be added to any of the adjustments we have received to build faith and strong testimonies in the hearts of God s children Let s not complicate things with additional meetings expectations or requirements Keep it simple It is in that simplicity that you will find the peace joy and happiness I have been talking about For years the leadership purposes of the Church as stated in Handbook 2 are outcomes that are clear and simple from which I quote Leaders encourage every member to receive all essential priesthood ordinances keep the associated covenants and qualify for exaltation and eternal life Adults Encourage each adult to be worthy to receive the ordinances of the temple Teach all adults to identify their ancestors and perform vicarious temple ordinances for them Youth Help prepare each young man to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood to receive the ordinances of the temple and to be worthy to serve a full time mission Help prepare each young woman to be worthy to make and keep sacred covenants and receive the ordinances of the temple Strengthen youth through participation in meaningful activities All Members Help priesthood and auxiliary leaders ward councils ward and full time missionaries and members work cooperatively in a balanced effort to rescue individuals strengthen families and Church units increase priesthood activity and gather Israel through conversion retention and activation Teach members to provide for themselves and their families and to assist the poor and needy in the Lord s way 13My service in the Church has blessed me with many remarkable and special spiritual experiences I am a witness that the Lord directs His Church to accomplish His purposes I have received divine guidance far beyond my capacity The joy of gospel living for me has been centered on the true pure and simple doctrine and gospel of Jesus Christ I have served under the keys and directions of six prophets and Church Presidents from Spencer W Kimball to Russell M Nelson I testify that each one of them was and is God s chosen prophet They have taught us essential principles about the Church and the gospel and doctrine of Christ President Nelson is carrying the Lord s work forward at a breathtaking pace I say breathtaking because he s the only one of the Apostles who is older than me and I am having a difficult time keeping up with him I am a witness that the priesthood keys and the mantle of a prophet of God are upon him President Nelson teaches the true pure and simple gospel of Jesus Christ I bear my testimony that Jesus is the Christ and this is His Church of which I testify humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters my talk was prepared some time before the passing of my dear wife Barbara My family and I thank you for your love and your outreach of kindness I pray the Lord will bless me as I speak to you this morning In October 1918 100 years ago President Joseph F Smith received a glorious vision After almost 65 years of dedicated service to the Lord in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and just a few weeks before his death on November 19 1918 he sat in his room pondering Christ s atoning sacrifice and reading the Apostle Peter s description of the Savior s ministry in the spirit world after His Crucifixion He recorded As I read I was greatly impressed As I pondered over these things the eyes of my understanding were opened and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me and I saw the hosts of the dead 1 The full text of the vision is recorded in Doctrine and Covenants section 138 Let me provide some background so that we may more fully appreciate Joseph F s lifetime of preparation to receive this remarkable revelation When he was President of the Church he visited Nauvoo in 1906 and reflected on a memory he had when he was just five years old He said This is the exact spot where I stood when Joseph my uncle and my father Hyrum came riding up on their way to Carthage Without getting off his horse father leaned over in his saddle and picked me up off the ground He kissed me good bye and put me down again and I saw him ride away 2The next time Joseph F saw them his mother Mary Fielding Smith lifted him up to see the martyrs lying side by side after being brutally murdered in Carthage Jail on June 27 1844 Two years later Joseph F along with his family and faithful mother Mary Fielding Smith left his home in Nauvoo for Winter Quarters Although not yet eight years old Joseph F was required to drive one of the oxteams from Montrose Iowa to Winter Quarters and then later on to the Salt Lake Valley arriving when he was almost 10 I hope you boys and young men are listening and will realize the responsibility and expectation placed on Joseph F during his boyhood Just four years later in 1852 when he was 13 his beloved mother died leaving Joseph and his siblings orphans 3Joseph F was called to serve a mission in the Hawaiian Islands in 1854 when he was 15 years old This mission which lasted more than three years was the beginning of a life of service in the Church Upon his return to Utah Joseph F married in 1859 4 For the next few years his life was filled with work family duties and two additional missions On July 1 1866 at the age of 27 Joseph F had his life forever changed when he was ordained an Apostle by Brigham Young In October the following year he filled a vacancy in the Council of the Twelve 5 He served as a counselor to Brigham Young John Taylor Wilford Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow before becoming President himself in 1901 6Joseph F and his wife Julina welcomed their first child Mercy Josephine into the family 7 She was only two and a half years old when she passed away Shortly after Joseph F recorded It is one month yesterday since my darling Josephine died O that I could have saved her to grow up to womanhood I miss her every day and I am lonely God forgive my weakness if it is wrong to love my little ones as I love them 8During his lifetime President Smith lost his father his mother one brother two sisters two wives and thirteen children He was well acquainted with sorrow and losing loved ones When his son Albert Jesse died Joseph F wrote to his sister Martha Ann that he had pled with the Lord to save him and asked Why is it so O God why had it to be 9Despite his prayers at that time Joseph F received no answer on this matter 10 He told Martha Ann that the heavens seemed like brass over our heads on the subject of death and the spirit world Nevertheless his faith in the Lord s eternal promises were firm and steadfast In the Lord s due time the additional answers comfort and understanding about the spirit world President Smith sought came to him through the marvelous vision he received in October 1918 That year was particularly painful for him He grieved over the death toll in the Great World War that continued to climb to over 20 million people killed Additionally a flu pandemic was spreading around the world taking the lives of as many as 100 million people During the year President Smith also lost three more precious family members Elder Hyrum Mack Smith of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles his firstborn son and my grandfather died suddenly of a ruptured appendix President Smith wrote I am speechless numb with grief My heart is broken and flutters for life O I loved him I will love him forever more And so it is and ever will be with all my sons and daughters but he is my first born son the first to bring me the joy and hope of an endless honorable name among men From the depths of my soul I thank God for him But O I needed him We all needed him He was most useful to the Church And now O what can I do O God help me 11The next month President Smith s son in law Alonzo Kesler died in a tragic accident 12 President Smith noted in his journal This most terrible and heart rending fatal accident has again cast a pall of gloom over all my family 13Seven months later in September 1918 President Smith s daughter in law and my grandmother Ida Bowman Smith died after giving birth to her fifth child my uncle Hyrum 14And so it was on October 3 1918 having experienced intense sorrow over the millions who had died in the world through war and disease as well as the deaths of his own family members President Smith received the heavenly revelation known as the vision of the redemption of the dead He alluded to the revelation the following day in the opening session of the October general conference President Smith s health was failing yet he spoke briefly I will not I dare not attempt to enter upon many things that are resting upon my mind this morning and I shall postpone until some future time the Lord be willing my attempt to tell you some of the things that are in my mind and that dwell in my heart I have not lived alone these last five months I have dwelt in the spirit of prayer of supplication of faith and of determination and I have had my communication with the Spirit of the Lord continuously 15The revelation he received on October 3 comforted his heart and provided answers to many of his questions We too can be comforted and learn more about our own future when we and our loved ones die and go to the spirit world by studying this revelation and pondering its significance in the way we live our lives each day Among the many things President Smith saw was the Savior s visit to the faithful in the spirit world after His own death on the cross From the vision I quote But behold from among the righteous he organized his forces and appointed messengers clothed with power and authority and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness even to all the spirits of men and women 16 and thus was the gospel preached to the dead These were taught faith in God repentance from sin vicarious baptism for the remission of sins the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands And all other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spirit For the dead had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage These the Lord taught and gave them power to come forth after his resurrection from the dead to enter into his Father s kingdom there to be crowned with immortality and eternal life And continue thenceforth their labor as had been promised by the Lord and be partakers of all blessings which were held in reserve for them that love him 17In the vision President Smith saw his father Hyrum and the Prophet Joseph Smith It had been 74 years since he had last seen them as a small boy in Nauvoo We can only imagine his joy at seeing his beloved father and uncle He must have been inspired and comforted to know that all spirits retain the likeness of their mortal body and that they are anxiously awaiting the day of their promised resurrection The vision revealed more fully the depth and breadth of Heavenly Father s plan for His children and Christ s redeeming love and the matchless power of His Atonement 18On this special 100th anniversary I invite you to thoroughly and thoughtfully read this revelation As you do so may the Lord bless you to more fully understand and appreciate God s love and His plan of salvation and happiness for His children I testify that the vision President Joseph F Smith received is true I bear witness that every person can read it and come to know it is true Those who do not receive this knowledge in this life will surely come to know its truthfulness when everyone will arrive in the spirit world There all will love and praise God and the Lord Jesus Christ for the great plan of salvation and the blessing of the promised Resurrection when body and spirit will once again be reunited never to be separated again 19How grateful I am to know where my precious Barbara is and that we will be together again with our family for all eternity May the peace of the Lord sustain us now and forever is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters we have just participated in a solemn assembly a practice that can be traced back to the Bible when ancient Israel gathered to feel the Lord s presence and celebrate His blessings 1 We are privileged to live in a time when this ancient practice has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith 2 I urge you to record in your personal journal what you felt regarding this most sacred occasion in which you have taken part Recently we said goodbye to our dear friend and prophet President Thomas S Monson Although we all miss him we are deeply grateful the Lord has called a new prophet President Russell M Nelson to preside over His Church In an orderly way we have now begun a new chapter in our Church history This is a precious gift from God As we each sustained President Nelson by our uplifted hands we stood as witnesses before God and acknowledged that he is President Monson s rightful successor With our raised hands we promised to hearken unto his voice as he receives direction from the Lord The Lord has said Thou shalt give heed unto all his meaning the President of the Church words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them For his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith 3I have known our new prophet president for over 60 years I have served with him in the Quorum of the Twelve for 33 years and I am a witness that the hand of the Lord has been preparing him to become our presiding apostle and prophet to administer all the keys of the holy priesthood on the earth May each one of us completely sustain him and his counselors and follow their direction We also warmly welcome Elder Gong and Elder Soares as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles After Jesus s Resurrection an event we celebrate this glorious Easter weekend He appeared to His disciples and said Peace be unto you as my Father hath sent me even so send I you 4 Notice a twofold action God sends His Son The Son sends His servants mortal men and women to accomplish Their work We should not be surprised to know that those individuals called to do the Lord s work are not humanly perfect Stories in the scriptures detail incidents about men and women who were called of God to accomplish a great work good sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father called to serve in their assignments in the Church striving to do their best but none of them yet perfect The same is true of us today Given the reality of our human weaknesses and shortcomings how do we move forward in supporting and sustaining each other It begins with faith real sincere faith in the Lord Jesus Christ Faith in the Savior is the first principle of the doctrine and gospel of Christ Several years ago I was visiting the Holy Land As we drove by a mustard plant the director of the BYU Jerusalem Center asked if I had ever seen a mustard seed I hadn t so we stopped He showed me the seeds from the mustard plant They were surprisingly small I then remembered Jesus s teachings For verily I say unto you If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain Remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you 5If we have faith as small as a mustard seed the Lord can help us remove the mountains of discouragement and doubt in the tasks ahead of us as we serve with God s children including family members Church members and those who are not yet members of the Church Brothers and sisters life can be filled with faith joy happiness hope and love when we exercise the smallest amount of real faith in Christ even a mustard seed of faith Elder George A Smith remembered some advice the Prophet Joseph Smith gave to him He told me I should never get discouraged whatever difficulties might surround me If I was sunk in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me I ought not to be discouraged but hang on exercise faith and keep up good courage and I should come out on the top of the heap at last 6We should remember Paul s declaration I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me 7 Knowing this is another precious gift from God In addition to the gifts I have mentioned there are many many more I speak now of just a few the gift of the Sabbath day the sacrament service to others and the matchless gift from God of our Savior The power of the Sabbath day is to experience in church and at home the delight the joy and the warmth of feeling the Spirit of the Lord without any kind of distraction Too many allow themselves to almost live online with their smart devices screens illuminating their faces day and night and earbuds in their ears blocking out the still small voice of the Spirit If we do not find time to unplug we may miss opportunities to hear the voice of Him who said Be still and know that I am God 8 Now there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of the advances in the technologies inspired by the Lord but we must be wise in their use Remember the gift of the Sabbath day The blessing of receiving the sacrament in sacrament meeting must never become routine or just something we do It is only 70 minutes in a whole week when we can pause and find more peace joy and happiness in our lives Partaking of the sacrament and renewing our covenants is a sign by us to the Lord that we do always remember Him His Atonement is a gracious gift from God The privilege of service to Heavenly Father s children is another opportunity to follow the example of His Beloved Son by serving one another Some service opportunities are formal in our family our Church callings and our participation in community service organizations Church members both men and women should not hesitate if they desire to run for public office at any level of government wherever they live Our voices are essential today and important in our schools our cities and our countries Where democracy exists it is our duty as members to vote for honorable men and women who are willing to serve Many opportunities to serve are informal without assignment and come as we reach out to others we meet in life s journey Remember Jesus taught the lawyer that we should love God and our neighbor as ourselves using the good Samaritan as an example 9Service opens a window by which we understand the life and ministry of Christ He came to serve as the scriptures teach even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many 10Peter may have given the best description of the Savior s mortal ministry in five words when he referred to Jesus who went about doing good 11The Lord Jesus Christ is our most precious of all gifts from God Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me 12Nephi captured the importance of our Savior when he declared We talk of Christ we rejoice in Christ we preach of Christ we prophesy of Christ and we write according to our prophecies that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins 13 We must keep Christ as the center of our lives at all times and in all places We should remember that it is His name that appears on our places of worship we are baptized in His name and we are confirmed ordained endowed and sealed in marriage in His name We partake of the sacrament and promise to take upon ourselves His name and become true Christians Finally we are asked in the sacrament prayer to always remember him 14As we prepare for Easter Sunday tomorrow let us remember that Christ is supreme He is the righteous Judge our faithful Advocate our blessed Redeemer the Good Shepherd the promised Messiah a true Friend and much much more He is indeed a very precious gift to us from our Father In our discipleship we have many demands concerns and assignments However some activities must always be at the heart of our Church membership Wherefore the Lord commands be faithful stand in the office which I have appointed unto you succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 15This is the Church in action This is pure religion This is the gospel in its true sense as we succor lift and strengthen those in spiritual and temporal need Doing so requires us to visit them and to assist them 16 that their testimonies of faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and His Atonement will be anchored in their hearts May the Lord help and bless us to treasure our many precious gifts from God including our membership in His restored Church I pray we will be filled with love for our Heavenly Father s children and be able to see their needs and be willing to answer their questions and concerns about the gospel in clear and kind ways that will increase understanding and appreciation for one another I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior What we will be taught at this general conference comes to us by inspiration from apostles and prophets from General Authorities and sister leaders who are General Officers of the Church May the joy and peace of the Lord abide with each one is my humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
One hundred seventy years ago Brigham Young looked across the Salt Lake Valley for the first time and declared This is the right place 1 He knew the place because the Lord had revealed it to him By 1869 more than 70 000 Saints had made a similar trek Despite their many differences in language culture and nationality they shared a testimony of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and a desire to build Zion a place of peace happiness and beauty in preparation for the Second Coming of the Savior Among those first Saints to arrive in Utah was Jane Manning James the daughter of a freed slave a convert to the restored Church and a most remarkable disciple who faced difficult challenges Sister James remained a faithful Latter day Saint until her death in 1908 She wrote I want to say right here that my faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is as strong today nay it is if possible stronger than it was the day I was first baptized I pay my tithes and offerings keep the word of wisdom I go to bed early and rise early I try in my feeble way to set a good example to all 2Sister James like so many other Latter day Saints not only built Zion with blood sweat and tears but also sought the Lord s blessings through living gospel principles as best she could while holding on in faith to Jesus Christ the great healer to all who sincerely seek Him The early Saints were not perfect but they established a foundation upon which we are building families and a society that love and keep covenants which is highlighted in various news stories around the world because of our commitment to Jesus Christ and our volunteer efforts to help those nearby and far away 3President Eyring may I add appreciation to the tens of thousands of yellow shirt angels serving in Texas Mexico and other places to your tribute I have a deep conviction that if we lose our ties to those who have gone before us including our pioneer forefathers and mothers we will lose a very precious treasure I have spoken about Faith in Every Footstep in the past and will continue in the future because I know that rising generations must have the same kind of faith that the early Saints had in the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel 4My own pioneer forefathers and mothers were among those faithful pioneers who pulled handcarts rode wagons and walked to Utah They like Sister Jane Manning James had deep faith in every one of their footsteps as they made their own trek Their journals are filled with descriptions of hardships hunger and sickness and also testimonies of their faith in God and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ They had few worldly goods but enjoyed an abundance of the blessings from the brotherhood and sisterhood they found in the Church of Jesus Christ When they could they lifted the downtrodden and blessed the sick through service to one another and by the priesthood of God The sisters in Cache Valley Utah ministered to the Saints in the spirit of the Relief Society to work in unity to help those in need 5 My great grandmother Margaret McNeil Ballard served at the side of her husband Henry as he presided as bishop of the Logan Second Ward for 40 years Margaret was the ward Relief Society president for 30 of those years She took into their home the poor the sick and the widowed and orphaned and she even clothed the dead in their clean temple robes Although it is appropriate and important to remember the historic 19th century Mormon pioneer trek we need to remember that the trek through life continues for each of us as we prove our own faith in every footstep New converts no longer gather to pioneer settlements in the western United States Instead converts gather to their local congregations where the Saints worship our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ With more than 30 000 congregations established around the world all are gathered to their own Zion As the scriptures note For this is Zion the pure in heart 6As we walk the road of life we are tested to see if we will observe to do all things whatsoever the Lord has commanded 7Many of us are on amazing journeys of discovery leading to personal fulfillment and spiritual enlightenment Some of us however are on a trek that leads to sorrow sin anguish and despair In this context please ask yourself What is your final destination Where are your footsteps taking you And is your journey leading you to that multiplicity of blessings the Savior has promised 8A trek back to our Heavenly Father is the most important trek of our lives and it continues each day each week each month and each year as we increase our faith in Him and in His Beloved Son Jesus Christ We must be careful where our footsteps in life take us We must be watchful and heed the counsel of Jesus to His disciples as He answered these questions Tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world And Jesus answered and said unto them Take heed that no man and I add woman deceive you 9Today I repeat earlier counsel from Church leaders Brothers and sisters keep the doctrine of Christ pure and never be deceived by those who tamper with the doctrine The gospel of the Father and the Son was restored through Joseph Smith the prophet for this last dispensation Do not listen to those who have not been ordained and or set apart to their Church calling and are not acknowledged by common consent of the members of the Church 10Be aware of organizations groups or individuals claiming secret answers to doctrinal questions that they say today s apostles and prophets do not have or understand Do not listen to those who entice you with get rich schemes Our members have lost far too much money so be careful In some places too many of our people are looking beyond the mark and seeking secret knowledge in expensive and questionable practices to provide healing and support An official Church statement issued one year ago states We urge Church members to be cautious about participating in any group that promises in exchange for money miraculous healings or that claims to have special methods for accessing healing power outside of properly ordained priesthood holders 11The Church Handbook counsels Members should not use medical or health practices that are ethically or legally questionable Local leaders should advise members who have health problems to consult with competent professional practitioners who are licensed in the countries where they practice 12Brothers and sisters be wise and aware that such practices may be emotionally appealing but may ultimately prove to be spiritually and physically harmful For our pioneer ancestors independence and self reliance were vital but their sense of community was just as important They worked together and helped one another overcome the physical and emotional challenges of their time For the men there was the priesthood quorum and the women were served by the Relief Society These outcomes have not changed in our day The Relief Society and the priesthood quorums provide for the spiritual and temporal well being of our members Stay on the gospel path by having faith in every footstep so you can return safely back to the presence of Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ The Lord is our precious Savior He is the Redeemer of the world We must honor His sacred name and not misuse it in any way always striving to keep His commandments If we do so He will bless us and lead us safely home I invite everyone within the sound of my voice to welcome and embrace anyone who is making his or her own trek today no matter where they are in their journey Please remember there is no blessing anyone can share greater than the message of the Restoration which when received and lived promises everlasting joy and peace even eternal life Let us use our energy strength and testimonies in assisting our missionaries to find teach and baptize God s children so they may have the power of the gospel doctrine guiding their daily lives We need to embrace God s children compassionately and eliminate any prejudice including racism sexism and nationalism Let it be said that we truly believe the blessings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ are for every child of God I testify that the trek continues and I invite you to stay on the gospel path as you continue pressing forward by reaching out to all of God s children in love and compassion that we may unitedly make our hearts pure and our hands clean to receive the multiplicity of blessings awaiting all who truly love our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son for which I humbly pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters it is now my assignment to speak to you and your assignment is to listen My goal is to finish my assignment before you finish yours I will do my best Over the years I have observed that those who accomplish the most in this world are those with a vision for their lives with goals to keep them focused on their vision and tactical plans for how to achieve them Knowing where you are going and how you expect to get there can bring meaning purpose and accomplishment to life Some have difficulty differentiating between a goal and a plan until they learn that a goal is a destination or an end while a plan is the route by which you get there For example we can have a goal to drive to a certain unfamiliar location and as some of you dear sisters know we men often think we know how to get there often resulting in our saying I know it must be just around the next corner My wife must be smiling The goal was clear but there wasn t a good plan in place to reach the destination Goal setting is essentially beginning with the end in mind And planning is devising a way to get to that end A key to happiness lies in understanding what destinations truly matter and then spending our time effort and attention on the things that constitute a sure way to arrive there God our Heavenly Father has given us the perfect example of goal setting and planning His goal is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man and woman 1 and His means to achieve it is the plan of salvation Our beloved Heavenly Father s plan includes giving us a growing stretching learning physical mortality through which we can become more like Him Clothing our eternal spirits in physical bodies living by the teachings and commandments of His Son the Lord Jesus Christ and forming eternal families allows us through the Savior s Atonement to fulfill God s goal of immortality and eternal life for His children with Him in His celestial kingdom Wise goal setting includes the understanding that short term goals are only effective if they lead to clearly understood longer term goals I believe that one important key to happiness is to learn how to set our own goals and establish our own plans within the framework of our Heavenly Father s eternal plan If we focus on this eternal path we will inevitably qualify to return to His presence It is good to have goals and plans for our careers for our education even for our golf game It is also important to have goals for our marriages our families and our Church councils and callings this is especially true for missionaries But our greatest and most overriding goals should fit into Heavenly Father s eternal plan Jesus said Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you 2Experts on goal setting tell us that the simpler and more straightforward a goal is the more power it will have When we can reduce a goal to one clear image or one or two powerful and symbolic words that goal can then become part of us and guide virtually everything we think and do I believe that there are two words that in this context symbolize God s goals for us and our most important goals for ourselves The words are return and receive To return to His presence and to receive the eternal blessings that come from making and keeping covenants are the most important goals we can set We return and receive by having unshaken faith in the Lord Jesus Christ relying wholly upon His merits pressing forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men and women feasting upon the word of Christ and endur ing to the end 3Lucifer did not accept our Father s plan that allowed us to return to His presence and receive His blessings In fact Lucifer rebelled and attempted to completely modify our Father s plan wanting to take the glory honor and power of God to himself As a result he was cast out with his minions from God s presence and became Satan yea even the devil the father of all lies to deceive and to blind men and women and to lead them captive at his will even as many as would not hearken unto the Lord s voice 4Because of his premortal choices Satan can neither return nor receive The only thing left for him is to oppose the Father s plan by using every possible enticement and temptation to bring us down and make us miserable like unto himself 5 Satan s plan to accomplish his diabolical goal applies to every individual generation culture and society He uses loud voices voices that seek to drown out the small and still voice of the Holy Spirit that can show us all things we should do to return and receive 6These voices belong to those who disregard gospel truth and who use the internet social and print media radio television and movies to present in an enticing way immorality violence ugly language filth and sleaze in a way that distracts us from our goals and the plans we have for eternity These voices may also include well intentioned individuals who are blinded by the secular philosophies of men and women and who seek to destroy the faith and divert the eternal focus of those who are simply trying to return to the presence of God and receive all that our Father hath 7I have found that to stay focused on returning and receiving the promised blessings I need to regularly take time to ask myself How am I doing It s kind of like having a personal private interview with yourself And if that sounds unusual think about it who in this world knows you better than you know yourself You know your thoughts your private actions your desires and your dreams goals and plans And you know better than anyone how you are progressing along the road to returning and receiving As a guide for me during this private personal review I like to read and ponder the introspective words found in the fifth chapter of Alma wherein Alma asks Have ye spiritually been born of God Have ye received his image in your countenances Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts 8 Alma s questions are a reminder of what our goals and plans ought to include in order to return and receive Remember the Savior s invitation to come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls 9As we increase our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ s power to give rest unto our souls by forgiving sins redeeming imperfect relationships healing the spiritual wounds that stifle growth and strengthening and enabling us to develop the attributes of Christ we will more deeply appreciate the magnitude of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ 10During the coming weeks find time to review your life s goals and your plans and make sure they align with our Heavenly Father s great plan for our happiness If you need to repent and change then consider doing so now Take the time to prayerfully think about what adjustments are needed to help you keep your eye single to the glory of God 11We must keep the doctrine and gospel of Jesus Christ at the center of our goals and plans Without Him no eternal goal is possible and our plans to achieve our eternal goals will surely fail One additional help is The Living Christ The Testimony of the Apostles 12 which was presented to the Church on January 1 2000 Place a copy where you can see it and take time to review each of the statements found in this inspired testimony of Christ by His special witnesses who signed it I would urge you to study it along with The Family A Proclamation to the World We speak often about the family proclamation but please remember to read it in light of the saving power of the living Christ Without the living Christ our fondest expectations will be unfulfilled As the family proclamation states The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally 13This can happen only because the living Christ is the atoning Savior and Redeemer of the world In this regard you may also consider searching the scriptures to expand your understanding of the specific truths found in The Living Christ Prayerfully reading The Living Christ is like reading the testimonies of Matthew Mark Luke John and the prophets of the Book of Mormon It will increase your faith in the Savior and help you stay focused on Him as you follow your plans to reach your eternal goals Despite our mistakes shortcomings detours and sins Jesus Christ s Atonement allows us to repent prepared to return and receive the matchless blessings God has promised to live forever with the Father and the Son in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom 14Now as you all know no one will escape death therefore our long term goal and plan should be that when we return to our Heavenly Father we will receive all that He has planned for each one of us 15I testify there is no greater goal in mortality than to live eternally with our Heavenly Parents and our beloved Savior the Lord Jesus Christ But it is more than just our goal it is also Their goal They have a perfect love for us more powerful than we can even begin to comprehend They are totally completely eternally aligned with us We are Their work Our glory is Their glory More than anything else They want us to come home to return and receive eternal happiness in Their presence My dear brothers and sisters in one week we will celebrate Palm Sunday commemorating Christ s triumphal entry into Jerusalem In two weeks we will celebrate Easter Sunday commemorating the Savior s triumph over death As we focus our attention on the Savior during these two special Sundays let us remember Him and renew our lifelong commitment to keeping His commandments Let us look deeply into our own lives setting our own goals and focusing our plans to align with God s in a way that will ultimately lead us toward our precious privilege to return and receive which is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Several years ago my family and I visited the Holy Land One of my vivid memories from our trip was a visit to the upper room in Jerusalem the traditional site of the Last Supper As we stood in that place I read to them from John 17 where Jesus pleads with His Father for His disciples I pray for them that they may be one as we are Neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word That they all may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us 1I was deeply moved while reading these words and found myself praying in that sacred place that I could ever be one with my family and with my Heavenly Father and with His Son Our precious relationships with families friends the Lord and His restored Church are among the things that matter most in life Because these relationships are so important they should be cherished protected and nurtured One of the most heart wrenching stories in scripture occurred when many of the Lord s disciples found it hard to accept His teachings and doctrine and they went back and walked no more with him 2As these disciples left Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked Will ye also go away 3Peter responded Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the living God 4In that moment when others focused on what they could not accept the Apostles chose to focus on what they did believe and know and as a result they remained with Christ Later on the day of Pentecost the Twelve received the gift of the Holy Ghost They became bold in their witness of Christ and began to understand more fully Jesus s teachings Today is no different For some Christ s invitation to believe and remain continues to be hard or difficult to accept Some disciples struggle to understand a specific Church policy or teaching Others find concerns in our history or in the imperfections of some members and leaders past and present Still others find it difficult to live a religion that requires so much Finally some have become weary in well doing 5 For these and other reasons some Church members vacillate in their faith wondering if perhaps they should follow those who went back and walked no more with Jesus If any one of you is faltering in your faith I ask you the same question that Peter asked To whom shall you go If you choose to become inactive or to leave the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints where will you go What will you do The decision to walk no more with Church members and the Lord s chosen leaders will have a long term impact that cannot always be seen right now There may be some doctrine some policy some bit of history that puts you at odds with your faith and you may feel that the only way to resolve that inner turmoil right now is to walk no more with the Saints If you live as long as I have you will come to know that things have a way of resolving themselves An inspired insight or revelation may shed new light on an issue Remember the Restoration is not an event but it continues to unfold Never abandon the great truths revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith Never stop reading pondering and applying the doctrine of Christ contained in the Book of Mormon Never fail to give equal time to the Lord through honest attempts to understand what the Lord has revealed As my dear friend and former colleague Elder Neal A Maxwell once said We should not assume that just because something is unexplainable by us it is unexplainable 6So before you make that spiritually perilous choice to leave I encourage you to stop and think carefully before giving up whatever it was that brought you to your testimony of the restored Church of Jesus Christ in the first place Stop and think about what you have felt here and why you felt it Think about the times when the Holy Ghost has borne witness to you of eternal truth Where will you go to find others who share your belief in personal loving Heavenly Parents who teach us how to return to Their eternal presence Where will you go to be taught about a Savior who is your best friend who not only suffered for your sins but who also suffered pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind so that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities 7 including I believe the infirmity of loss of faith Where will you go to learn more about Heavenly Father s plan for our eternal happiness and peace a plan that is filled with wondrous possibilities teachings and guidance for our mortal and eternal lives Remember the plan of salvation gives mortal life meaning purpose and direction Where will you go to find a detailed and inspired Church organizational structure through which you are taught and supported by men and women who are deeply committed to serving the Lord by serving you and your family Where will you go to find living prophets and apostles who are called by God to give you another resource for counsel understanding comfort and inspiration for the challenges of our day Where will you go to find people who live by a prescribed set of values and standards that you share and want to pass along to your children and grandchildren And where will you go to experience the joy that comes through the saving ordinances and covenants of the temple Brothers and sisters accepting and living the gospel of Christ can be challenging It has always been thus and it ever will be Life can be like hikers ascending a steep and arduous trail It is a natural and normal thing to occasionally pause on the path to catch our breath to recalculate our bearings and to reconsider our pace Not everyone needs to pause on the path but there is nothing wrong with doing so when your circumstances require In fact it can be a positive thing for those who take full advantage of the opportunity to refresh themselves with the living water of the gospel of Christ The danger comes when someone chooses to wander away from the path that leads to the tree of life 8 Sometimes we can learn study and know and sometimes we have to believe trust and hope In the end each one of us must respond to the Savior s question Will ye also go away 9 We all have to search for our own answer to that question For some the answer is easy for others it is difficult I don t pretend to know why faith to believe comes easier for some than for others I m just so grateful to know that the answers are always there and if we seek them really seek with real intent and with full purpose of a prayerful heart we will eventually find the answers to our questions as we continue on the gospel path In my ministry I have known those who have drifted and returned after their trial of faith My sincere hope is that we will invite an increasing number of God s children to find and stay on the gospel path so they too can partake of the fruit which is desirable above all other fruit 10My heartfelt plea is that we will encourage accept understand and love those who are struggling with their faith We must never neglect any of our brothers and sisters We are all at different places on the path and we need to minister to one another accordingly Just as we should open our arms in a spirit of welcoming new converts so too should we embrace and support those who have questions and are faltering in their faith Utilizing another familiar metaphor I pray that anyone thinking of leaving the Old Ship Zion where God and Christ are at the helm will pause and think carefully before doing so Please know that even though great storms of wind and waves beat upon the old ship the Savior is on board and is able to rebuke the storm with His command Peace be still Until then we must not fear and we must have unwavering faith and know that even the wind and the sea obey him 11Brothers and sisters I promise you in the name of the Lord that He will never abandon His Church and that He will never abandon any one of us Remember Peter s response to the Savior s question and words To whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the living God 12I testify that there is no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men only in and through the name of Christ 13I also testify that Jesus Christ has called apostles and prophets in our day and restored His Church with teachings and commandments as a refuge from the storm and from wrath that will surely come unless the people of the world repent and return to Him 14I further testify that the Lord inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denieth none that come unto him black and white bond and free male and female and all are alike unto God 15Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer and His restored gospel will lead us safely back to the presence of our Heavenly Parents if we remain on the gospel path and follow in His footsteps To which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters the irony of being parents is that we tend to get good at it after our children are grown I will share with you this afternoon something I wish I had understood better when Barbara and I began to raise our precious children During my apostolic ministry I have frequently emphasized the power and importance of Church councils including mission stake ward and auxiliary councils I believe councils are the most effective way to get real results Additionally I know councils are the Lord s way and that He created all things in the universe through a heavenly council as mentioned in the holy scripture 1Until now however I have never talked in general conference about the most basic and fundamental and perhaps the most important of all councils the family council Family councils have always been needed They are in fact eternal We belonged to a family council in the premortal existence when we lived with our heavenly parents as their spirit children A family council when conducted with love and with Christlike attributes will counter the impact of modern technology that often distracts us from spending quality time with each other and also tends to bring evil right into our homes Please remember that family councils are different from family home evening held on Mondays Home evenings focus primarily on gospel instruction and family activities Family councils on the other hand can be held on any day of the week and they are primarily a meeting at which parents listen to each other and to their children I believe there are at least four types of family councils First a general family council consisting of the entire family Second an executive family council consisting of a mother and father Third a limited family council consisting of parents and one child Fourth a one on one family council consisting of one parent and one child In all of these family council settings electronic devices need to be turned off so everyone can look at and listen to each other During family councils and at other appropriate times you may want to have a basket for the electronic devices so when the family gathers everyone including Mom and Dad can deposit his or her phones tablets and MP3 players in the basket Thereafter they can counsel together without being tempted to respond to a poke on Facebook to a text to Instagram to Snapchat or to email alerts Let me briefly share with you how each of these types of family councils can work First the full family council includes all family members The Church pamphlet entitled Our Family states This council can meet to discuss family problems work out finances make plans support and strengthen each other and pray for one another and for the family unit 2This council should meet at a predesignated time and is normally more formal than any other type of family council It should start with a prayer or it may simply be a natural extension of conversations already started in other settings Please note that a family council may not always have a formal beginning or ending When parents are prepared and children listen and participate in the discussion the family council is truly working No matter what our particular family situation is it is critical that we understand the unique circumstances of each family member Though we may share DNA there may be situations and circumstances among us that may make us vastly different from each other and which may require the compassionate collaboration of the family council For example all the talking and sharing and loving in the world may not solve a medical problem or an emotional challenge that one or more family members may be facing At such times the family council becomes a place of unity loyalty and loving support as outside help is enlisted in the search for solutions Siblings especially the older ones can be powerful mentors to young children if parents will use the family council to enlist their help and support during times of difficulty and duress In this way a family is much like a ward When the bishop involves ward council members he can solve problems and accomplish a lot of good in ways he never could do without their help In a similar fashion parents need to involve all family members in dealing with challenges and adversity That way the power of the family council is put to work When council members feel they are part of a decision they become supporters and specific positive results can be accomplished Not every family council consists of two parents and children Your family council may look very different than our family council looked when we were raising our seven children Today our family council consists only of Barbara and me unless we hold an extended family council that includes our adult children their spouses and sometimes our grandchildren and great grandchildren Those who are single and even students living away from home can follow the divine council pattern by gathering with friends and roommates to counsel together Consider how the atmosphere in an apartment would change if roommates gathered regularly to pray listen discuss and plan things together Everyone can adapt a family council to take advantage of this divine pattern established by our loving Heavenly Father As noted previously from time to time an expanded family council may be helpful An expanded family council can be composed of grandparents and adult children who are not living at home Even if grandparents or adult children live far away they can participate in family councils via the telephone Skype or FaceTime You may want to consider holding the general family council on Sunday which is the first day of the week families can review the past week and plan for the coming week This may be exactly what your family needs to help make the Sabbath a delightful experience The second type of family council is an executive family council that involves only the parents During this time together parents can review each child s physical emotional and spiritual needs and his or her progress The executive family council is also a good time for wives and husbands to talk about their personal relationships with each other When Elder Harold B Lee performed our sealing he taught us a principle that I believe all couples will find helpful He said Never retire without kneeling together holding hands and saying your prayers Such prayers invite Heavenly Father to counsel us by the power of the Spirit The third type of family council is a limited family council Here both parents spend time with an individual child in a formal or an informal setting This is an opportunity for a discussion on making decisions in advance about such things as what he or she will and will not do in the future When such decisions are made he or she may want to record them for future reference if needed If your son or daughter sees you as a staunch supporter this council meeting can establish goals and objectives for the future This is also a time to carefully listen to serious concerns and challenges that a child may have faced with such things as lack of confidence abuse bullying or fear The fourth type of family council is a one on one family council involving one parent and one child This type of family council generally just happens For example the parent and child can take advantage of informal opportunities while traveling in the car or working around the house An outing with one child with either father or mother can provide a special spiritual and emotional bonding time Calendar these in advance so children can anticipate and look forward to a special time alone with Mom or Dad Now brothers and sisters there was a time when the walls of our homes provided all the defense we needed against outside intrusions and influences We locked the doors closed the windows we shut the gates and we felt safe secure and protected in our own little refuge from the outside world Those days are now gone The physical walls doors fences and gates of our homes cannot prevent unseen invasion from the Internet the Wi Fi the mobile phones the networks They can penetrate our homes with just a few clicks and keystrokes Fortunately the Lord has provided a way to counter the invasion of negative technology that can distract us from spending quality time with each other He has done this by providing the council system to strengthen protect safeguard and nurture our most precious relationships Children desperately need parents willing to listen to them and the family council can provide a time during which family members can learn to understand and love one another Alma taught Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings and he will direct thee for good 3 Inviting the Lord to be part of our family council through prayer will improve our relationships with each other We can with Heavenly Father and our Savior s help become more patient thoughtful helpful forgiving and understanding as we pray for help With Their help we can make our homes a little bit of heaven here on earth A family council that is patterned after the councils in heaven filled with Christlike love and guided by the Lord s Spirit will help us to protect our family from distractions that can steal our precious time together and protect us from the evils of the world Combined with prayer a family council will invite the presence of the Savior as He promised For where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them 4 Inviting the Spirit of the Lord to be part of your family council brings blessings beyond description Finally please remember that a family council held regularly will help us spot family problems early and nip them in the bud councils will give each family member a feeling of worth and importance and most of all they will assist us to be more successful and happy in our precious relationships within the walls of our homes May our Heavenly Father bless all of our families as we counsel together is my humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
In last October s general conference I invited listeners to follow Brigham Young s counsel to stay on the Old Ship Zion which is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and to hold on with both hands 1 Since then I am happy to know that some of my family and others were listening and have asked me this question What s in the Old Ship Zion that we should hang on to I reminded them of what President Brigham Young said We are on the old ship Zion God is at the helm and will stay there He dictates guides and directs If the people will have implicit confidence in their God never forsake their covenants nor their God He will guide us right 2Clearly our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ have outfitted the Old Ship Zion with clear and simple eternal truths that will help us stay the course through the troubled waters of mortal life Here are just a few The Church of Jesus Christ has always been led by living prophets and apostles Though mortal and subject to human imperfection the Lord s servants are inspired to help us avoid obstacles that are spiritually life threatening and to help us pass safely through mortality to our final ultimate heavenly destination During my nearly 40 years of close association I have been a personal witness as both quiet inspiration and profound revelation have moved to action the prophets and apostles the other General Authorities and the auxiliary leaders While neither perfect nor infallible these good men and women have been perfectly dedicated to leading the work of the Lord forward as He has directed And make no mistake about it the Lord directs His Church through living prophets and apostles This is the way He has always done His work Indeed the Savior taught Verily verily I say unto you He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me 3 We cannot separate Christ from His servants Without His first Apostles we would not have an eyewitness account of many of His teachings His ministry His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and His death on the cross Without their testimonies we would not have an apostolic witness of the empty tomb and the Resurrection He commanded those first Apostles Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you 4This commission was renewed in our own day when the Lord called Joseph Smith to restore the Church with ordained Apostles to declare His gospel one last time before He will come again It has always been a challenge for the world to accept living prophets and apostles but it is so essential to do so in order to fully understand the Atonement and the teachings of Jesus Christ and to receive a fulness of the blessings of the priesthood that are given to those He has called Too many people think Church leaders and members should be perfect or nearly perfect They forget that the Lord s grace is sufficient to accomplish His work through mortals Our leaders have the best intentions but sometimes we make mistakes This is not unique to Church relationships as the same thing occurs in our relationships among friends neighbors and workplace associates and even between spouses and in families Looking for human weakness in others is rather easy However we make a serious mistake by noticing only the human nature of one another and then failing to see God s hand working through those He has called Focusing on how the Lord inspires His chosen leaders and how He moves the Saints to do remarkable and extraordinary things despite their humanity is one way that we hold on to the gospel of Jesus Christ and stay safely aboard the Old Ship Zion A second truth is the doctrine of the plan of salvation Through the Prophet Joseph Smith God gave the Book of Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants and many additional teachings to the Church These include a knowledge of the plan of salvation which is a map of where we came from our purpose here on earth and where we are going when we die The plan also provides us with a unique eternal perspective that we are God s spirit children By understanding who our Heavenly Father is and our relationship to Him and to His Beloved Son Jesus Christ we will accept Their commandments and make covenants with Them that will lead us back into Their eternal presence Every time I hold a newborn child I find myself wondering Who are you little one What will you become through the Atonement of Christ We ask similarly reflective questions when someone we love dies Where are they What are they seeing and experiencing Does life continue What will be the nature of our most cherished relationships in the great world of the spirits of the dead In that world our family has two granddaughters Sara and Emily and a grandson Nathan With each grandchild s passing we as a family held on to the gospel truths with both hands Our questions were answered with comfort and assurance through the Atonement of the Savior Although we miss our grandchildren we know they live and we know we will see them again How grateful we are for this spiritual understanding in times of personal and familial turbulence Another key truth in the Church is that Heavenly Father created Adam and Eve for a lofty purpose It was their charge and subsequently the charge of their posterity to create mortal bodies for God s spirit children so they could experience mortality By this process Heavenly Father sends His spirit children to earth to learn and grow through the experiences of earth life Because He loves His children God sends heavenly messengers and Apostles to teach them about Jesus Christ s central role as our Savior Through the centuries prophets have fulfilled their duty when they have warned people of the dangers before them The Lord s Apostles are duty bound to watch warn and reach out to help those seeking answers to life s questions Twenty years ago the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued The Family A Proclamation to the World In that inspired document we concluded with the following We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity who abuse spouse or offspring or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God Further we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets 5As Apostles we reaffirm this solemn warning again today Please remember that commandments and covenants are priceless truths and doctrines found in the Old Ship Zion where God is at the helm Another important doctrine that we should cling to is to observe the Sabbath day This helps us remain unspotted from the world provides us with physical rest and gives each of us the spiritual refreshment of worshipping the Father and the Son every Sunday 6 When we delight in the Sabbath day it is a sign of our love for Them 7As part of our efforts to make the Sabbath a delight we have asked local leaders and Church members to remember that sacrament meeting is the Lord s and should be rooted and grounded in His teachings The presentation of the ordinance of the sacrament is when we renew our covenants and reconfirm our love for the Savior and remember His sacrifice and His Atonement This same spirit of worship should permeate our monthly fast and testimony meetings This sacrament meeting is for members to briefly express gratitude love and appreciation for our Heavenly Father Jesus Christ and the restored gospel and to bear personal witness of these things Fast and testimony meeting is a time to share brief inspirational thoughts and bear solemn testimony It is not a time to give a speech Young children should practice sharing their testimonies in Primary and with their parents in family home evening gatherings until they understand the important meaning of a testimony The recent emphasis of making the Sabbath a delight is a direct result of inspiration from the Lord through the leaders of the Church Ward council members should assist the bishopric several weeks in advance by reviewing music and topics that have been recommended for each sacrament meeting All of us are blessed when the Sabbath is filled with love for the Lord at home and at church When our children are taught in the ways of the Lord they learn to feel and to respond to His Spirit We will all desire to attend each Sunday to partake of the sacrament when we feel the Spirit of the Lord And all young and old who are carrying heavy burdens will feel the spiritual uplift and comfort that comes from a Sabbath day of devoted contemplation of our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Thankfully Christ is always near waiting and willing to help us when we pray for help and are willing to repent and come unto Him Now as we ponder just these few truths that exist within the Old Ship Zion let us stay on board and remember that by definition a ship is a vehicle and the purpose of a vehicle is to take us to a destination Our ship s destination is the full blessings of the gospel the kingdom of heaven the celestial glory and the presence of God God s plan is in place He is at the helm and His great and powerful ship flows toward salvation and exaltation Remember that we cannot get there by jumping out of the boat and trying to swim there by ourselves Exaltation is the goal of this mortal journey and no one gets there without the means of the gospel of Jesus Christ His Atonement the ordinances and the guiding doctrine and principles that are found in the Church It is the Church wherein we learn the works of God and accept the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that saves us It is within the Church that we form the commitments and covenants of eternal families that become our passport to exaltation It is the Church that is powered by the priesthood to propel us through the unpredictable waters of mortality Let us be grateful for the beautiful Old Ship Zion for without it we are cast adrift alone and powerless swept along without rudder or oar swirling with the strong currents of the adversary s wind and waves Hold tight brothers and sisters and sail on within the glorious ship The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and we will reach our eternal destination This is my testimony and prayer for all of us in the name of Him for whom the Old Ship Zion is named even our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen 
One of the great pleasures I enjoy as I travel throughout the world is the opportunity to meet and greet our missionaries These great elders and sisters radiate the Light of Christ and I am always inspired by their love for the Lord Jesus Christ and their devoted service to Him Every time I shake hands with them and feel of their remarkable spirit and faith I say to myself These wonderful sons and daughters of ours are truly a miracle During the October 2002 general priesthood meeting I challenged bishops parents and prospective missionaries to raise the bar for full time missionary service I then said that what we need is the greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the Church We need worthy qualified spiritually energized missionaries We need your whole heart and soul We need vibrant thinking passionate missionaries who know how to listen to and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit 1In many ways the world today is more challenging than it was 13 years ago Our young men and young women have many more distractions to sidetrack them in their preparations for both a mission and a future happy life Technology has expanded and almost everyone has access to handheld devices that can capture the attention of the human family of God for both great good and unconscionable ill Tonight I speak to missionaries now serving future missionaries returned missionaries and all young adult men in the Church I pray you will understand and thoughtfully consider what I have to say to you as you journey through these exciting and exacting years of your life In the early days of the Church missionaries were interviewed by a General Authority before they went on their missions These days you are interviewed to serve as missionaries by your bishops and stake presidents and most of you will go through your entire lives without being interviewed by a General Authority That is simply a reflection of the reality in a worldwide church of more than 15 million members I know I speak for my brethren when I tell you that we wish it were possible for us to know all of you personally and to be able to tell you that we love you and that we support you Fortunately the Lord has provided ways for us to reach out to you For example a member of the Quorum of the Twelve assigns every missionary to his or her mission Although this is done without a traditional face to face interview technology and revelation combine to provide an experience that is remarkably intimate and personal Let me tell you how this happens Your photograph comes up on a computer screen together with key information provided by your bishop and stake president When your picture appears we look into your eyes and review your answers to the missionary recommendation questions For that brief moment it seems as if you are present and responding to us directly As we look at your photograph we trust that you have cleared in every way the raised bar required today to be a faithful successful missionary Then by the power of the Spirit of the Lord and under the direction of President Thomas S Monson we assign you to one of the Church s 406 worldwide missions No it isn t the same as a personal face to face interview But it s close Videoconferencing is another way that helps us reach out to Church leaders and members who live far away from Church headquarters With that in mind I would like those of you preparing to serve missions those who have returned and all of you young adults to spend a few minutes with me as though we were having a personal video chat right now Please look at me for a few minutes as though you and I were the only ones in the room wherever you are tonight For my part I will imagine that I am looking into your eyes and listening carefully to your responses to a few questions that I believe will tell me a lot about the depth of your testimony and your devotion to God If I may paraphrase what I said to missionaries 13 years ago what we need now is the greatest generation of young adults in the history of the Church We need your whole heart and soul We need vibrant thinking passionate young adults who know how to listen and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit as you make your way through the daily trials and temptations of being a young contemporary Latter day Saint In other words it s time to raise the bar not only for missionaries but also for returned missionaries and for your entire generation To that end please ponder in your heart your answers to these questions Do you search the scriptures regularly Do you kneel in prayer to talk with your Heavenly Father each morning and each night Do you fast and donate a fast offering each month even if you are a poor struggling student who can t afford to donate much Do you think deeply about the Savior and His atoning sacrifice for you when you are asked to prepare bless pass or partake of the sacrament Do you attend your meetings and strive to keep the Sabbath day holy Are you honest at home school church and work Are you mentally and spiritually clean Do you avoid viewing pornography or looking at websites magazines movies or apps including Tinder and Snapchat photos that would embarrass you if your parents Church leaders or the Savior Himself saw you Are you careful with your time avoiding inappropriate technology and social media including video games which can dull your spiritual sensitivity Is there anything in your life you need to change and fix beginning tonight Thank you for this short personal visit I hope you answered each one of these questions honestly and thoughtfully If you find yourself lacking in any of these simple principles then I urge you to courageously repent and bring your life back in line with gospel standards of righteous discipleship Now brethren may I offer additional counsel that will help you get your testimony of the gospel deep in your hearts and your souls I remind you returned missionaries that your preparation for life and for a family should be continuous RM doesn t mean retired Mormon As a returned missionary you should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of your own free will and bring to pass much righteousness 2Please use the skills you learned on your mission to bless the lives of people around you every day Do not shift your focus from serving others to focusing exclusively on school work or social activities Instead balance your life with spiritual experiences that remind and prepare you for continued daily ministering to others During your missions you learned the importance of visiting people in their homes I would hope that all of our young adults whether or not you served full time missions understand the importance of visiting with people who are lonely sick or discouraged not only as an assignment but also because of the genuine love you have for Heavenly Father and His children Those of you in high school preparing for missions I encourage you to participate in and graduate from seminary You young adults should enroll in an institute of religion 3 If you are attending a Church school consistently include a class each semester in religious education During this important season of preparation for a mission eternal marriage and life as an adult you must continue to find ways to learn and grow and receive inspiration and guidance through the Holy Ghost A careful prayerful study of the gospel through seminary institute or religious education classes can assist you in that goal Whether you attend a Church school or not whether you attend college or not do not think that you are too busy to study the gospel Seminary institute or religion classes will provide balance to your life and add to your secular education by giving you another opportunity to spend time studying the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles There are four outstanding new courses that I would encourage every young adult to look into and to attend 4And don t forget that classes and activities offered at your local institute or through your young single adult ward or stake will also be a place where you can be with other young men and young women and lift and inspire one another as you learn and grow spiritually and socialize together Brethren if you will set aside your cell phone and actually look around a little you may even find your future companion at the institute Which leads me to another bit of counsel that I m sure you knew was coming You single adults need to date and marry Please stop delaying I know some of you fear family formation However if you marry the right person at the right time and in the right place you need not fear In fact many problems you encounter will be avoided if you are anxiously engaged in righteous dating courting and marriage Don t text her Use your own voice to introduce yourself to the righteous daughters of God who are all around you To actually hear a human voice will shock her perhaps into saying yes Now brethren I testify to you that the Lord Jesus Christ can help us fix anything that needs fixing in our lives through His atoning sacrifice This evening as we prepare to celebrate Easter Sunday tomorrow please pause with me to remember the gift of Christ s Atonement Remember that our Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus Christ know you best and love you the most Through the Atonement the Redeemer took upon Himself our troubles pains and sins The Savior of the world came to understand each of us individually by experiencing our dashed hopes challenges and tragedies through His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross 5 He died as one final act of love for us and was buried in a new tomb on that fateful night On Sunday morning Jesus rose from the dead promising new life for each of us The risen Lord then commissioned His disciples to teach everyone to have faith in Christ repent of sin be baptized receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and endure to the end Brethren we know that God our Father and His Beloved Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and restored through him the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ Be strong brethren Keep the commandments of God The Lord Jesus Christ promises that all things we desire to do in righteousness will be ours Church leaders are counting on you We need every one of you young adults to prepare to marry to serve and to lead in the days ahead for which I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Recently a friend of mine took his son on a trip down the Colorado River through Cataract Canyon located in southeastern Utah The canyon is famous for its 14 miles 23 km of white water rapids that can be particularly hazardous In preparation for their adventure they had carefully reviewed the National Park Service website which contains important information about personal preparedness and common hidden hazards At the beginning of the trip one of the experienced river guides reviewed important safety instructions emphasizing three rules that would ensure the group s safe travel through the rapids Rule number one stay in the boat Rule number two always wear a life jacket Rule number three always hold on with both hands He then said again with even more emphasis Above all remember rule number one stay in the boat This adventure reminds me of our mortal journey Most of us experience periods in our lives where the tranquil waters of life are appreciated At other times we encounter white water rapids that are metaphorically comparable to those found in the 14 mile stretch through Cataract Canyon challenges that may include physical and mental health issues the death of a loved one dashed dreams and hopes and for some even a crisis of faith when faced with life s problems questions and doubts The Lord in His goodness has provided help including a boat essential supplies such as life jackets and experienced river guides who give guidance and safety instructions to help us make our way down the river of life to our final destination Let s think about rule number one stay in the boat President Brigham Young commonly employed the Old Ship Zion as a metaphor for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints He said on one occasion We are in the midst of the ocean A storm comes on and as sailors say she labors very hard I am not going to stay here says one I don t believe this is the Ship Zion But we are in the midst of the ocean I don t care I am not going to stay here Off goes the coat and he jumps overboard Will he not be drowned Yes So with those who leave this Church It is the Old Ship Zion let us stay in it 1On another occasion President Young said that he also worried about people losing their way when they were being blessed when life was good It is in calm weather when the old ship of Zion is sailing with a gentle breeze and when all is quiet on deck that some of the brethren want to go out in the whaling boats to have a swim and some get drowned others drifted away and others again get back to the ship Let us stick to the old ship and she will carry us safely into the harbor you need not be concerned 2And finally President Young reminded the Saints We are on the old ship Zion God is at the helm and will stay there All is right sing Hallelujah for the Lord is here He dictates guides and directs If the people will have implicit confidence in their God never forsake their covenants nor their God He will guide us right 3Given the challenges we all face today how do we stay on the Old Ship Zion Here is how We need to experience a continuing conversion by increasing our faith in Jesus Christ and our faithfulness to His gospel throughout our lives not just once but regularly Alma asked And now behold I say unto you my brethren and sisters if ye have experienced a change of heart and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love I would ask can ye feel so now 4The experienced river guides today can be likened to the Church s apostles and prophets and inspired local priesthood and auxiliary leaders They help us arrive safely to our final destination Recently I spoke at the new mission presidents seminar and counseled these leaders Keep the eyes of the mission on the leaders of the Church We will not and cannot lead you astray And as you teach your missionaries to focus their eyes on us teach them to never follow those who think they know more about how to administer the affairs of the Church than Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ do through the priesthood leaders who have the keys to preside I have discovered in my ministry that those who have become lost and confused are typically those who have most often forgotten that when the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve speak with a united voice it is the voice of the Lord for that time The Lord reminds us Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same D C 1 38 5In other words they leave the Old Ship Zion they fall away they apostatize Tragically they often experience short term and eventually long term unintended consequences not only for themselves but also for their families Our local Church leaders like seasoned river guides have been tutored by life s experiences have been trained and mentored by apostles and prophets and other officers of the Church and most important have been tutored by the Lord Himself On another occasion this year I spoke to the young adults of the Church in the May CES devotional broadcast I said I have heard that some people think the Church leaders live in a bubble What they forget is that we are men and women of experience and we have lived our lives in so many places and worked with many people from different backgrounds Our current assignments literally take us around the globe where we meet the political religious business and humanitarian leaders of the world Although we have visited leaders in the White House in Washington D C and leaders of nations and religions throughout the world we have also visited the most humble families and people on earth When you thoughtfully consider our lives and ministry you will most likely agree that we see and experience the world in ways few others do You will realize that we live less in a bubble than most people There is something about the individual and combined wisdom of the Church leaders that should provide some comfort We have experienced it all including the consequences of different public laws and policies disappointments tragedies and deaths in our own families We are not out of touch with your lives 6Along with rule number one as I ve applied it remember rules two and three always wear a life jacket and hold on with both hands The words of the Lord are found in the scriptures and the teachings of the apostles and prophets They provide us counsel and direction that when followed will act like a spiritual life jacket and will help us know how to hold on with both hands We need to become like the sons of Mosiah who waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth We can become men and women of a sound understanding This can be accomplished only by our search ing the scriptures diligently that we might know the word of God 7In searching the scriptures and the words of past and current apostles and prophets we should focus on studying living and loving the doctrine of Christ In addition to developing the habit of personal scripture reading we need to be like the sons of Mosiah and give ourselves to much prayer and fasting 8It seems that these things which are not easily measured are of great importance Stay focused on these simple things and avoid becoming distracted As I have known people who have not stayed in the boat and have not held on with both hands during times of trials and troubles or who have not stayed in the boat during times of relative calm I have observed that many of them have lost their focus on the central truths of the gospel the reasons why they joined the Church in the first place the reasons they remained fully committed and active in living gospel standards and blessing others through dedicated consecrated service and the ways in which the Church has been in their lives a place of spiritual nourishment and growth 9Joseph Smith taught this central truth The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the apostles and prophets concerning Jesus Christ that he died was buried and rose again the third day and ascended up into heaven and all other things are only appendages to these which pertain to our religion 10If we keep our focus on the Lord we are promised a blessing beyond comparison Wherefore ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men Wherefore if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life 11Sometimes faithful Latter day Saints and sincere investigators begin to focus on the appendages instead of on the fundamental principles That is Satan tempts us to become distracted from the simple and clear message of the restored gospel Those so distracted often give up partaking of the sacrament because they have become focused even preoccupied with less important practices or teachings Others may focus on the questions and doubts they experience Of course having questions and experiencing doubts are not incongruent with dedicated discipleship Recently the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated We understand that from time to time Church members will have questions about Church doctrine history or practice Members are always free to ask such questions and earnestly seek greater understanding 12Remember Joseph Smith himself had questions that began the Restoration He was a seeker and like Abraham found the answers to life s most important questions The important questions focus on what matters most Heavenly Father s plan and the Savior s Atonement Our search should lead us to become kind gentle loving forgiving patient and dedicated disciples We must be willing as Paul taught to bear ye one another s burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ 13To bear another s burdens includes helping supporting and understanding everyone including the sick the infirm the poor in spirit and body the seeker and the troubled and also other member disciples including Church leaders who have been called by the Lord to serve for a season Brothers and sisters stay in the boat use your life jackets and hold on with both hands Avoid distractions And if any one of you have fallen out of the boat we will seek you find you minister to you and pull you safely back onto the Old Ship Zion where God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are at the helm and will guide us right to which I humbly testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Sixty four years ago this September I returned home from my mission in England Three days after returning I attended a Hello Day dance at the University of Utah with a friend of mine He told me about a beautiful sophomore named Barbara Bowen whom he thought I ought to meet He brought her over and introduced us and we started to dance Unfortunately this was what we used to call a tag dance which meant that you got to dance with the girl only until somebody else tagged you out Barbara was vivacious and popular so I got to dance with her for less than a minute before another young man tagged me out That was just not acceptable to me Having learned the importance of follow up on my mission I got her telephone number and called her the very next day to ask her out but she was busy with school and social commitments Thankfully my mission taught me to be persistent even in the face of discouragement and I was eventually able to make a date And that date led to others Somehow during those dates I was able to convince her that I was the only true and living returned missionary at least as far as she should be concerned Now 64 years later there are seven children and many grandchildren and great grandchildren who stand as evidence of the significant truth that no matter how good your message is you may not get a chance to deliver it without consistent persistent follow up This may be why I have felt the clear impression to follow up today on two of my previous general conference messages In the October 2011 conference I urged that we remember these important words of the Lord For thus shall my church be called in the last days even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 1With these words the Lord makes clear that this is not only a formal title but also the name by which His Church is to be called Given His clear declaration we should not refer to the Church by any other name such as Mormon Church or LDS Church The term Mormon can be appropriately used in some contexts to refer to members of the Church such as Mormon pioneers or to institutions such as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Church members are widely known as Mormons and in interactions with those not of our faith we may fittingly refer to ourselves as Mormons provided we couple this with the full name of the Church If members learn to use the correct name of the Church in connection with the word Mormon it will underscore that we are Christians members of the Savior s Church Brothers and sisters let us follow up and develop the habit of always making it clear that we belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints The second message that I feel I should follow up on was delivered just last general conference when I encouraged members to pray to be led to at least one person to whom they could extend an invitation to learn about the restored gospel before Christmas Many Church members have shared with me some special experiences as a consequence of their asking the Lord for missionary opportunities One returned missionary for example specifically prayed to be led to the one he could reach The name of a former college classmate came into his mind He reached out to her over Facebook and he learned that she had been praying for purpose and meaning in her life He followed up just at the time she was searching for the truth and in December she was baptized Many similar invitations were reported to me but only a few people have followed up like this brother did I m a great believer in the principle of follow up As it says in the missionary guide Preach My Gospel extending an invitation without following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a ticket to a concert without going into the theater Without the completed action the commitment is hollow 2Preach My Gospel teaches everyone not only how to invite but also how to follow up on our invitations The purpose of missionary work is defined as inviting others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement repentance baptism receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost and enduring to the end 3Inviting is certainly part of the process But notice that there is much more to missionary work for members than simply extending invitations to people to listen to the missionaries It also includes follow up with the missionaries in the cultivation of faith the motivation to repentance the preparation for making covenants and enduring to the end This follow up principle is illustrated in the book of Acts Now Peter and John went up together into the temple And a certain man lame from his mother s womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said Look on us And he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them Then Peter said Silver and gold have I none but such as I have give I thee In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk That s a powerful invitation from a servant of the Lord isn t it But Peter didn t stop with the invitation The scriptural narrative next tells us that he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength And he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God 4In other words Peter didn t simply invoke his priesthood authority and invite the man to rise up and walk He also followed up on his invitation by reaching out to the man taking him by the right hand lifting him up and then walking with him into the temple In the spirit of Peter s example may I suggest that we can all be more consistently involved in missionary work by replacing our fear with real faith inviting someone at least once a quarter or four times every year to be taught by the full time missionaries They are prepared to teach by the Spirit with sincere and heartfelt inspiration from the Lord Together we can follow up on our invitations take others by the hand lift them up and walk with them on their spiritual journey To help you in this process I invite all members regardless of your current calling or level of activity in the Church to obtain a copy of Preach My Gospel It is available through our distribution centers and also online The online version can be read or downloaded at no cost It is a guidebook for missionary work which means it is a guidebook for all of us Read it study it and then apply what you learn to help you understand how to bring souls to Christ through invitation and follow up As President Thomas S Monson has said Now is the time for members and missionaries to come together to work together to labor in the Lord s vineyard to bring souls unto Him 5Jesus Christ taught His disciples The harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest 6The Lord has answered that prayer in our day with the greatest number of full time missionaries in the history of the world With this new wave of faithful laborers the Lord has given us another opportunity to assist Him in that great harvest of souls There are practical ways for members to help and support our remarkable missionaries For example you can tell the missionaries that you are studying Preach My Gospel and ask them to show you what they are learning in their studies As you share with each other increased confidence between members and full time missionaries will surely develop just as the Lord commanded But that every man and woman might speak in the name of God the Lord even the Savior of the world 7And Behold I sent you out to testify and warn the people and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor 8Brothers and sisters can you imagine the impact if family and friends included things they are learning from their personal study of Preach My Gospel in their letters and emails to their full time missionaries Can you picture the blessings that will come to families when they know and understand better what their sons and daughters will be studying and teaching on their missions Can you even begin to fathom the extraordinary outpouring of atoning grace that will be ours individually and collectively according to the Savior s promise to all who bear testimony in the process of inviting souls to come unto Him and then following up on those invitations Ye are blessed the Lord said through the Prophet Joseph Smith for the testimony which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon and they rejoice over you and your sins are forgiven you 9 For I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment that you remain steadfast in bearing testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you 10If we follow up the Lord will not let us down I have seen the unspeakable joy that accompanies testimony driven inviting and faithful follow up among members of the Church the world over While in Argentina recently I encouraged members to invite someone to church before this general conference An eight year old by the name of Joshua listened and invited his best friend and his friend s family to an open house at their ward in Buenos Aires Let me read from a letter I just received that explained Joshua s invitation and his faithful follow up Every few minutes Joshua would run out to the gate to see if they were coming He said that he knew they would come The evening wore on and Joshua s friend did not come but Joshua did not give up He faithfully checked the front gate every few minutes It was time to start putting things away when Joshua started to jump up and down announcing They are here They are here I looked up to see an entire family approaching the church Joshua ran out to greet them and hugged his friend They all came in and seemed to enjoy the open house very much They took some pamphlets and spent lots of time getting acquainted with some new friends It was great to see the faith of this little boy and to know that Primary children can be missionaries too 11It is my testimony that as we work together seeking the one inviting and following up with trust and faith the Lord will smile upon us and hundreds of thousands of God s children will find purpose and peace in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints May the Lord bless all of us in our efforts to hasten the work of salvation I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Sister Ballard and I recently returned from an assignment to five countries in Europe There we had the privilege of meeting with many of our missionaries perhaps some of your sons and your daughters Since President Thomas S Monson s announcement of the lowering of the age for our young men and our young women to serve I have had the privilege of meeting with over 3 000 of them The Light of Christ radiates in their faces and they are eager to move the work forward to find and teach to baptize to activate and to strengthen and to build the kingdom of God Meeting with them one quickly comes to know however that they cannot do this work alone Today I want to speak to all members of the Church because there is an urgency for each one of us to be engaged in sharing the gospel As has been quoted many times the Prophet Joseph Smith declared that after all that has been said the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 330 In 1974 President Spencer W Kimball said this Perhaps the greatest reason for missionary work is to give the world its chance to hear and accept the gospel The scriptures are replete with commands and promises and calls and rewards for teaching the gospel I use the word command deliberately for it seems to be an insistent directive from which we singly and collectively cannot escape When the World Will Be Converted Ensign Oct 1974 4 In July of that same year Sister Ballard and I left with our children to preside over the Canada Toronto Mission The words of President Kimball were ringing in my ears especially when he said My brethren I wonder if we are doing all we can Are we complacent in our approach to teaching all the world We have been proselyting now 144 years Are we prepared to lengthen our stride To enlarge our vision Ensign Oct 1974 5 He also asked us to quicken our pace working together to build up the Church and kingdom of God This past June President Thomas S Monson echoed exactly the same message to members of the Church The President said Now is the time for members and missionaries to come together and labor in the Lord s vineyard to bring souls unto Him He has prepared the means for us to share the gospel in a multitude of ways and He will assist us in our labors if we will act in faith to fulfill His work Faith in the Work of Salvation address given at a special broadcast June 23 2013 lds org broadcasts It is good brothers and sisters to reflect on the teachings of the prophets from the time of Joseph Smith to today They have encouraged and called upon the leadership and the members of the Church to be anxiously engaged in bringing the message of the Restoration of the gospel to all of our Heavenly Father s children in all of the world My message this afternoon is that the Lord is hastening His work In our day this can be done only when every member of the Church reaches out with love to share the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ We need to work together in partnership with our 80 000 missionaries now serving Information about this great work especially the assignments for the stake and ward council leaders is clearly outlined on the LDS org website entitled Hastening the Work of Salvation We know from our research that most active members of the Church want the blessings of the gospel to be part of the lives of others whom they love even those whom they have never met But we also know that many members hesitate to do missionary work and share the gospel for two basic reasons The first one is fear Many members do not even pray for opportunities to share the gospel fearing that they might receive divine promptings to do something they think they are not capable of doing The second reason is misunderstanding of what missionary work is We know that when someone gets up to give a talk in sacrament meeting and says Today I ll be talking about missionary work or perhaps even when Elder Ballard gets up in general conference and says the same thing some of you listening may think Oh no not again we have heard this before Now we know that no one likes feeling guilty Perhaps you feel you may be asked to do unrealistic things in your relationships with friends or neighbors With the help of the Lord let me remove any fear you or any of our full time missionaries may have in sharing the gospel with others Make the decision to do what Jesus Christ has asked us to do The Savior has said Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you For every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened Or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone Or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent If ye know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him Matthew 7 7 11 Brothers and sisters fear will be replaced with faith and confidence when members and the full time missionaries kneel in prayer and ask the Lord to bless them with missionary opportunities Then we must demonstrate our faith and watch for opportunities to introduce the gospel of Jesus Christ to our Heavenly Father s children and surely those opportunities will come These opportunities will never require a forced or a contrived response They will flow as a natural result of our love for our brothers and sisters Just be positive and those whom you speak with will feel your love They will never forget that feeling though the timing may not be right for them to embrace the gospel That too may change in the future when their circumstances change It is impossible for us to fail when we do our best when we are on the Lord s errand While the outcome is a result of the exercise of one s agency sharing the gospel is our responsibility Trust the Lord He is the Good Shepherd He knows His sheep and His sheep know His voice and today the voice of the Good Shepherd is your voice and my voice And if we are not engaged many who would hear the message of the Restoration will be passed by Simply stated it s a matter of faith and action on our part The principles are pretty simple pray personally and in your family for missionary opportunities The Lord has said in the Doctrine and Covenants that many people have been kept from the truth only because they know not where to find it D C 123 12 You don t have to be an outgoing person or an eloquent persuasive teacher If you have an abiding love and hope within you the Lord has promised if you lift up your voices unto this people and speak the thoughts that He shall put into your hearts you shall not be confounded before men And it shall be given you in the very moment what ye shall say D C 100 5 6 Preach My Gospel reminds all of us that nothing happens in missionary work until we find someone to teach Talk with as many people as you can each day It is natural to be somewhat apprehensive about talking to people but you can pray for the faith and strength to be more bold in opening your mouth to proclaim the restored gospel 2004 156 57 You full time missionaries if you want to teach more you must talk to more people every day This has always been what the Lord has sent missionaries forth to do The Lord knows us He knows we have our challenges I realize that some of you may feel heavy laden but I pray that none of you would ever feel that reaching out in normal pleasant ways to share the gospel would ever be a burden Rather it is a privilege There is no greater joy in life than being anxiously engaged in the service of the Lord The key is that you be inspired of God that you ask Him for direction and then go and do as the Spirit prompts you When members view the work of salvation as their responsibility alone it can be intimidating When they view it as an invitation to follow the Lord in bringing souls unto Him to be taught by the full time elders and sisters it is inspiring invigorating and uplifting We are not asking everyone to do everything We are simply asking all members to pray knowing that if every member young and old will reach out to just one between now and Christmas millions will feel the love of the Lord Jesus Christ And what a wonderful gift to the Savior Six weeks ago I received a letter from a very successful member missionary family the Munns family of Florida They wrote Dear Elder Ballard 30 minutes after the worldwide broadcast on hastening the work of salvation we held our family missionary council We were thrilled to find that our teenage grandchildren wanted to be included We re happy to report that since our council meeting we have expanded our family teaching pool by 200 percent We have had grandchildren bring friends to church have enjoyed sacrament meetings with some of our less active friends and have had some of our new contacts commit to take the missionary discussions One of our less active sisters has not only returned to church but has brought new investigators with her No one has turned down the invitation to take the missionary discussions What an exciting time to be a member of this Church personal letter Aug 15 2013 Heed the promptings of the Spirit Supplicate the Lord in mighty prayer Become engaged in doing what you can in sharing the great message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ I quote from another successful member missionary Clayton Christensen Every time you take someone figuratively by the hand and introduce him or her to Jesus Christ you will feel how deeply our Savior loves you and loves the person whose hand is in yours The Power of Everyday Missionaries The What and How of Sharing the Gospel 2013 1 God bless you brothers and sisters to find the great joy that comes from experiencing miracles through your faith As we are taught in Moroni chapter 7 Christ hath said If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me For it is by faith that miracles are wrought and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men wherefore if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men for it is because of unbelief and all is vain Moroni 7 33 37 From my own experience I can testify to you that the Lord will hear your prayers and you will have many opportunities now and for years to come to introduce the gospel of Jesus Christ to Heavenly Father s precious children President Monson we have listened We will all seek to find the one I pray that all of us may experience the great joy that comes from missionary service in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
President Packer we re all looking forward to the 98 version of that wonderful poem What a wonderful instruction he gave to us A few weeks ago on a cold dark winter s night my wife Barbara and I looked in awe up at the sky The millions of stars seemed exceptionally bright and beautiful I then turned to the Pearl of Great Price and read again with wonder what the Lord God said to Moses And worlds without number have I created and I also created them for mine own purpose and by the Son I created them which is mine Only Begotten Moses 1 33 In our day the Hubble deep space telescope has confirmed the magnitude of what Moses saw Hubble scientists say the Milky Way galaxy of which our earth and sun are just a tiny part is estimated to be only one of over 200 billion similar galaxies For me it is difficult to comprehend impossible to fathom so large and so vast are God s creations Brothers and sisters the power by which the heavens and earth were and are created is the priesthood Those of us who are members of the Church know that the source of this priesthood power is God Almighty and His Son Jesus Christ Not only is the priesthood the power by which the heavens and the earth were created but it is also the power the Savior used in His mortal ministry to perform miracles to bless and heal the sick to bring the dead to life and as our Father s Only Begotten Son to endure the unbearable pain of Gethsemane and Calvary thus fulfilling the laws of justice with mercy and providing an infinite Atonement and overcoming physical death through the Resurrection It is the keys of this priesthood authority and resultant power that He gave to Peter James and John and His other Apostles to bless others and to bind in heaven that which is bound on earth The power of the priesthood is a sacred and essential gift of God It is different from priesthood authority which is the authorization to act in God s name The authorization or ordination is given by the laying on of hands The power of the priesthood comes only when those who exercise it are worthy and acting in accordance with God s will As President Spencer W Kimball declared The Lord has given to all of us as holders of the priesthood certain of his authority but we can only tap the powers of heaven on the basis of our personal righteousness Boys Need Heroes Close By Ensign May 1976 45 During the glorious days of the Restoration and the reestablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ in the world today John the Baptist Peter James and John Moses Elias and Elijah came to the earth and restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith all of the keys and authority of the priesthood for the work of God in these latter days It is by these keys this authority and this power that the Church of Jesus Christ is organized today with Christ at the head directing His living prophet Thomas S Monson and assisted by duly called and ordained Apostles In our Heavenly Father s great priesthood endowed plan men have the unique responsibility to administer the priesthood but they are not the priesthood Men and women have different but equally valued roles Just as a woman cannot conceive a child without a man so a man cannot fully exercise the power of the priesthood to establish an eternal family without a woman In other words in the eternal perspective both the procreative power and the priesthood power are shared by husband and wife And as husband and wife a man and a woman should strive to follow our Heavenly Father The Christian virtues of love humility and patience should be their focus as they seek the blessings of the priesthood in their lives and for their family It is crucial for us to understand that Heavenly Father has provided a way for all of His sons and His daughters to have access to the blessings of and be strengthened by the power of the priesthood Central to God s plan for His spirit children is His own declaration This is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 In the revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in section 81 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord explains that the power of the priesthood is to be used to succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees verse 5 And in doing such things thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow beings and wilt promote the glory of him who is your Lord D C 81 4 As we think about the imagery of succoring the weak lifting up the hands which hang down and strengthening feeble knees I am reminded of a sweet seven year old showing her grandfather a small tomato plant she had started from seed as part of a second grade school project She explained that from one tiny seed would come a plant And if the plant were cared for it would grow many tomatoes that would each have many seeds She said And if all of those seeds were planted and grew more tomatoes and you planted all of those seeds in a few seasons you would have millions of tomatoes All she said in amazement from one little seed But then she said I almost killed my plant I left it in a dark room and forgot to water it When I remembered the plant it was all wilted and dead looking I cried because I thought of all of those millions of tomatoes that would never grow She was then excited to tell her grandfather about the miracle that happened She explained Momma said maybe the plant wasn t dead Maybe all it needed was some water and some light to bring life back And she was right I gave the plant some water and I put it in the window for light And guess what she asked It came back to life and now it s going to grow millions of tomatoes Her small tomato plant so full of potential but so weakened and wilted from unintentional neglect was strengthened and revived through the simple ministration of water and light by the little girl s loving and caring hands Brothers and sisters as the literal spirit children of our loving Heavenly Father we have unlimited divine potential But if we are not careful we can become like the wilted tomato plant We can drift away from the true doctrine and gospel of Christ and become spiritually undernourished and wilted having removed ourselves from the divine light and living waters of the Savior s eternal love and priesthood power Those who hold the priesthood and fail to constantly strive to honor it by serving our families and others will be like those who do not receive the blessings inherent in the power of the priesthood and will surely wilt spiritually having deprived themselves of the essential spiritual nutrients light and power of God in their lives much like the tomato plant so full of potential but neglected and wilted The same priesthood power that created worlds galaxies and the universe can and should be part of our lives to succor strengthen and bless our families our friends and our neighbors in other words to do the things that the Savior would do if He were ministering among us today And the primary purpose of this priesthood power is to bless sanctify and purify us so we can live together with our families in the presence of our heavenly parents bound by priesthood sealings participating in the marvelous work of God and Jesus Christ in forever expanding Their light and glory To this end a few months ago I had the opportunity to participate in making a video based worldwide leadership training presentation called Strengthening the Family and the Church through the Priesthood This innovative and instructive DVD is translated into 66 languages It teaches how the power of the priesthood can bless vitalize and revitalize our lives the lives of our families and the lives of all the members of the Church It shows us all men women children married widowed or single no matter what our circumstances how we can be partakers of the blessings of the priesthood There are several 8 to 12 minute segments that explain the keys authority and power of the priesthood and how it strengthens individuals families and the Church One special scene was filmed in the very small pioneer home of my mother s great grandmother Mary Fielding Smith She was the widow of Hyrum the Prophet Joseph s older brother As a single parent through her strong faith in the priesthood she called upon and relied on that power to raise and bless her children in love and the light of the gospel Today her posterity of thousands of faithful leaders and members of the Church thank her for her faith courage and example This new leadership training is now available on the Internet at LDS org for all to see and experience wwlt lds org You can stream it live from LDS org or you can download it to your computer smartphone or tablet devices The First Presidency has asked stake presidencies and bishoprics to dedicate one or more stake or ward council meetings to viewing the entire DVD Stake and ward councils should discuss how to implement the teachings that are presented First Presidency letter Feb 1 2013 The content will inspire and motivate members in priesthood quorums Relief Society Sunday School Young Women Young Men especially those preparing for missions and in Primary meetings or combined fifth Sunday gatherings Council members will then be able to encourage individuals and parents to use this presentation with their families Brothers and sisters this leadership training is for every member of the Church Parents review share and discuss what you learn and feel with your children and let them watch and do the same with you that your families may be strengthened through the priesthood Jesus said If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink John 7 37 Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life John 4 14 I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall have the light of life John 8 12 If any one of you feels your faith or your testimony of Heavenly Father s plan is less than you know it should be then turn more fully to the Savior Let His light and His living water do for you and your family what a little water and light did in bringing life back to the weakened tomato plant Now I began with the wonder and awe in the creations of God through the power of the priesthood I stand here wondering as I suppose most of you also do if God s power to instruct and bless us can ever be fully comprehended It is so great so majestic so powerful Joseph Smith said The Priesthood is an everlasting principle and existed with God from eternity and will to eternity without beginning of days or end of years Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 104 God has freely given His power to those who accept and honor His priesthood which leads to the promised blessings of immortality and eternal life I testify that the work of Jesus Christ is accomplished through the priesthood It is the power by which our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son created this earth and set in motion the great plan of happiness for our sakes May we be wise and seek to strengthen our own lives the lives of our families and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints through the power of the priesthood of God is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Elder Perry I think you must be the youngest 90 year old in the whole Church You noticed how he jumped out of his chair My beloved brothers and sisters each time I enjoy a fresh vine ripened tomato or eat a juicy peach right off the tree my thoughts go back 60 years to when my father owned a small peach orchard in Holladay Utah He kept beehives there to pollinate the peach blossoms that would eventually grow into very large delicious peaches Father loved his gentle honeybees and marveled at the way thousands of them working together transformed the nectar gathered from his peach blossoms into sweet golden honey one of nature s most beneficial foods In fact nutritionists tell us it is one of the foods that includes all the substances enzymes vitamins minerals and water necessary to sustain life My father always tried to involve me in his work with his hives but I was very happy to let him tend to his bees However since those days I have learned more about the highly organized beehive a colony of about 60 000 bees Honeybees are driven to pollinate gather nectar and condense the nectar into honey It is their magnificent obsession imprinted into their genetic makeup by our Creator It is estimated that to produce just one pound 0 45 kg of honey the average hive of 20 000 to 60 000 bees must collectively visit millions of flowers and travel the equivalent of two times around the world Over its short lifetime of just a few weeks to four months a single honeybee s contribution of honey to its hive is a mere one twelfth of one teaspoon Though seemingly insignificant when compared to the total each bee s one twelfth of a teaspoon of honey is vital to the life of the hive The bees depend on each other Work that would be overwhelming for a few bees to do becomes lighter because all of the bees faithfully do their part The beehive has always been an important symbol in our Church history We learn in the Book of Mormon that the Jaredites carried honeybees with them see Ether 2 3 when they journeyed to the Americas thousands of years ago Brigham Young chose the beehive as a symbol to encourage and inspire the cooperative energy necessary among the pioneers to transform the barren desert wasteland surrounding the Great Salt Lake into the fertile valleys we have today We are the beneficiaries of their collective vision and industry The beehive symbol is found in both the interiors and exteriors of many of our temples This podium where I stand is made from the wood of a walnut tree grown in President Gordon B Hinckley s backyard and is adorned with carved beehive images All of this symbolism attests to one fact great things are brought about and burdens are lightened through the efforts of many hands anxiously engaged in a good cause D C 58 27 Imagine what the millions of Latter day Saints could accomplish in the world if we functioned like a beehive in our focused concentrated commitment to the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ The Savior taught that the first and great commandment is Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets Matthew 22 37 39 40 The Savior s words are simple yet their meaning is profound and deeply significant We are to love God and to love and care for our neighbors as ourselves Imagine what good we can do in the world if we all join together united as followers of Christ anxiously and busily responding to the needs of others and serving those around us our families our friends our neighbors our fellow citizens As the Epistle of James notes service is the very definition of pure religion see James 1 27 We read of the service Church members provide around the world and especially the humanitarian service given in times of crisis fires and floods and hurricanes and tornadoes These much needed and much appreciated emergency responses should certainly continue as a way of bearing one another s burdens But what about our everyday lives What would be the cumulative effect of millions of small compassionate acts performed daily by us because of our heartfelt Christian love for others Over time this would have a transformative effect upon all of our Heavenly Father s children through the extension of His love to them through us Our troubled world needs this love of Christ today more than ever and it will need it even more in the years ahead These simple daily acts of service may not seem like much in and of themselves but when considered collectively they become just like the one twelfth teaspoon of honey contributed by a single bee to the hive There is power in our love for God and for His children and when that love is tangibly manifest in millions of acts of Christian kindness it will sweeten and nourish the world with the life sustaining nectar of faith hope and charity What do we need to do to become like the dedicated honeybees and have that dedication become part of our nature Many of us are dutiful in attending our Church meetings We work hard in our callings and especially on Sundays That is surely to be commended But are our minds and our hearts just as anxiously engaged in good things during the rest of the week Do we just go through the motions or are we truly converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ How do we take the seed of faith that has been nurtured in our minds and plant it deep in the fertile soil of our souls How do we make the mighty change of heart that Alma says is essential for our eternal happiness and peace see Alma 5 12 21 Remember honey contains all of the substances necessary to sustain mortal life And the doctrine and gospel of Christ is the only way to obtain eternal life Only when our testimony transcends what is in our mind and burrows deep into our heart will our motivation to love and to serve become like unto the Savior s It is then and only then that we become deeply converted disciples of Christ empowered by the Spirit to reach the hearts of our fellowmen When our hearts are no longer set upon the things of this world we will no longer aspire to the honors of men or seek only to gratify our pride see D C 121 35 37 Rather we take on the Christlike qualities that Jesus taught We are gentle and meek and long suffering see D C 121 41 We are kind without hypocrisy or guile see D C 121 42 We feel charity toward all men see D C 121 45 Our thoughts are always virtuous see D C 121 45 We no longer desire to do evil see Mosiah 5 2 The Holy Ghost is our constant companion and the doctrines of the priesthood distill upon our souls as the dews from heaven see D C 121 45 46 Now brothers and sisters I m not encouraging religious zealotry or fanaticism Quite the contrary I m simply suggesting that we take the next logical step in our complete conversion to the gospel of Christ by assimilating its doctrines deep within our hearts and our souls so we will act and live consistently and with integrity what we profess to believe This integrity simplifies our lives and amplifies our sensitivities to the Spirit and to the needs of others It brings joy into our lives and peace to our souls the kind of joy and peace that comes to us as we repent of our sins and follow the Savior by keeping His commandments How do we make this change How do we ingrain this love of Christ into our hearts There is one simple daily practice that can make a difference for every member of the Church including you boys and girls you young men and you young women you single adults and you fathers and mothers That simple practice is In your morning prayer each new day ask Heavenly Father to guide you to recognize an opportunity to serve one of His precious children Then go throughout the day with your heart full of faith and love looking for someone to help Stay focused just like the honeybees focus on the flowers from which to gather nectar and pollen If you do this your spiritual sensitivities will be enlarged and you will discover opportunities to serve that you never before realized were possible President Thomas S Monson has taught that in many instances Heavenly Father answers another person s prayers through us through you and me through our kind words and deeds through our simple acts of service and love And President Spencer W Kimball said God does notice us and he watches over us But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs Therefore it is vital that we serve each other Teachings of Presidents of the Church Spencer W Kimball 2006 82 I know that if you do this at home at school at work and at church the Spirit will guide you and you will be able to discern those in need of a particular service that only you may be able to give You will be prompted by the Spirit and magnificently motivated to help pollinate the world with the pure love of Christ and His gospel And remember like the little honeybee s one twelfth teaspoon of honey provided to the hive if we multiply our efforts by tens of thousands even millions of prayerful efforts to share God s love for His children through Christian service there will be a compounding effect of good that will bring the Light of Christ to this ever darkening world Bound together we will bring love and compassion to our own family and to the lonely the poor the broken and to those of our Heavenly Father s children who are searching for truth and peace It is my humble prayer brothers and sisters that we will ask in our daily prayers for the inspiration to find someone for whom we can provide some meaningful service including the service of sharing the gospel truths and our testimonies At the end of each day may we be able to say yes to the questions Have I done any good in the world today Have I helped anyone in need Hymns no 223 This is God s work May we be about it as faithfully as the dedicated little honeybees go about theirs I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters according to the scriptures the Liahona was a round ball of curious workmanship featuring two spindles one of which pointed the way Father Lehi s family should go into the wilderness 1 Nephi 16 10 I think I know why Lehi was greatly astonished when he first saw it because I remember my reaction when I first saw and witnessed a GPS unit In my mind it was a modern day device of curious workmanship Somehow in some way I can t even imagine this little device right in my phone can pinpoint exactly where I am and tell me exactly how to get where I want to go For both my wife Barbara and me the GPS is a blessing For Barbara it means she doesn t have to tell me to stop and ask for directions and for me it means I can be right when I say I don t need to ask anyone I know exactly where I m going Now brothers and sisters we have available to us a tool even more remarkable than the best GPS Everyone loses his or her way at some point to some degree It is through the promptings of the Holy Ghost that we can be brought safely back onto the right path and it is the atoning sacrifice of the Savior that can return us home Being lost can apply to whole societies as well as to individuals Today we live in a time when much of this world has lost its way particularly with regard to values and priorities within our homes One hundred years ago President Joseph F Smith connected happiness directly to the family and admonished us to focus our efforts there He said There can be no genuine happiness separate and apart from the home There is no happiness without service and there is no service greater than that which converts the home into a divine institution and which promotes and preserves family life The home is what needs reforming Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph F Smith 1998 382 384 It is our homes and families that need reforming in this increasingly materialistic and secular world A stunning example is the growing disregard for marriage here in the United States Earlier this year the New York Times reported that the share of children born to unmarried women has crossed a threshold more than half of births to American women under 30 occur outside marriage Jason DeParle and Sabrina Tavernise Unwed Mothers Now a Majority Before Age of 30 New York Times Feb 18 2012 A1 We also know that among couples in the United States who do marry nearly half get divorced Even those who stay married often lose their way by letting other things interfere with their family relationships Equally worrisome is the ever growing gap between the rich and poor and between those who strive to preserve family values and commitments and those who have given up on doing so Statistically those who have less education and consequently lower incomes are less likely to marry and to go to church and much more likely to be involved in crime and to have children outside of marriage And these trends are also troubling in much of the rest of the world See W Bradford Wilcox and others No Money No Honey No Church The Deinstitutionalization of Religious Life among the White Working Class available at www virginia edu marriageproject pdfs Religion WorkingPaper pdf Opposite of what many had thought prosperity and education seem to be connected to a higher likelihood of having traditional families and values The real question of course is about cause and effect Do some sectors of our society have stronger values and families because they are more educated and prosperous or are they more educated and prosperous because they have values and strong families In this worldwide Church we know that it is the latter When people make family and religious commitments to gospel principles they begin to do better spiritually and often temporally as well And of course societies at large are strengthened as families grow stronger Commitments to family and values are the basic cause Nearly everything else is effect When couples marry and make commitments to each other they greatly increase their chances of economic well being When children are born in wedlock and have both a mom and a dad their opportunities and their likelihood of occupational success skyrocket And when families work and play together neighborhoods and communities flourish economies improve and less government and fewer costly safety nets are required So the bad news is that family breakdown is causing a host of societal and economic ills But the good news is that like any cause and effect those ills can be reversed if what is causing them is changed Inequities are resolved by living correct principles and values Brothers and sisters the most important cause of our lifetime is our families If we will devote ourselves to this cause we will improve every other aspect of our lives and will become as a people and as a church an example and a beacon for all peoples of the earth But this is not easy in a world where hearts are turning in many directions and where the whole planet seems to be constantly moving and changing at a pace never before imagined Nothing stays the same for long Styles trends fads political correctness and even perceptions of right and wrong shift and move As the prophet Isaiah predicted wrong is portrayed as right and right as wrong see Isaiah 5 20 The spiritual divide gets even wider as evil becomes ever more deceptive and subtle and pulls people toward it like a dark magnet even as the gospel of truth and light attracts the honest in heart and the honorable of the earth who seek what is moral and good We may be relatively small in number but as members of this Church we can reach across these widening gaps We know the power of Christ centered service that brings together God s children regardless of their spiritual or their economic status One year ago the First Presidency invited us to participate in a day of service celebrating 75 years of the welfare program which helps people to become more self sufficient Millions of hours were contributed by our members all around the world The Church is a mooring in this tempestuous sea an anchor in the churning waters of change and division and a beacon to those who value and seek righteousness The Lord uses this Church as a tool in pulling His children throughout the world toward the protection of His gospel The Spirit of Elijah which has no boundaries is also a great power in the Lord s purposes for the eternal destiny of His children In Malachi s words the Spirit of the Holy Ghost turns the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers Malachi 4 6 The Church stands as an example of heart turning and as a catalyst for good in the world Among Church members who are married in the temple and who regularly attend Sunday meetings the divorce rate is significantly less than that of the world and families remain closer and are in more frequent communication The health in our families is better and we live several years longer than the population average We contribute more financial resources and more service per capita to those in need and we are more likely to seek higher education I point out these things not to boast but to testify that life is better and much happier as hearts turn toward family and as families live in the light of the gospel of Christ So what can we do to not become lost First may I suggest that we prioritize Put everything you do outside the home in subjection to and in support of what happens inside your home Remember President Harold B Lee s counsel that the most important work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes Teachings of Presidents of the Church Harold B Lee 2000 134 and President David O McKay s timeless No other success can compensate for failure in the home quoted from J E McCulloch Home The Savior of Civilization 1924 42 in Conference Report Apr 1935 116 Organize your personal lives to provide time for prayer and scriptures and family activity Give your children responsibilities in the home that will teach them how to work Teach them that living the gospel will lead them away from the filth promiscuity and violence of the Internet media and video games They will not be lost and they will be prepared to handle responsibility when it is thrust upon them Second we need to do things in the right order Marriage first and then family Too many in the world have forgotten this natural order of things and think they can change it or even reverse it Remove any of your fear with faith Trust the power of God to guide you To you who are not yet married pay careful attention to finding your eternal companion Young men remember something else that President Joseph F Smith said Bachelorhood carries to the superficial mind the idea that it is desirable because it brings with it the minimum of responsibility The real fault lies with the young men The license of the age leads them from paths of duty and responsibility Their sisters are the victims and would marry if they could and would accept cheerfully the responsibilities of family life Gospel Doctrine 5th ed 1939 281 And to you young women I would add that you must also not lose sight of this responsibility No career can bring you as much fulfillment as rearing a family And when you are my age you will realize this even more Third husbands and wives you should be equal partners in your marriage Read often and understand the proclamation on the family and follow it Avoid unrighteous dominion in any form No one owns a spouse or children God is the Father of us all and has extended to us the privilege of our own family which was previously only His to help us become more like Him As His children we should learn at home to love God and to know that we can ask Him for the help we need Everyone married or single can be happy and supportive within whatever family you may have And finally use the family resources of the Church In raising children families can draw upon the help of the ward Support and work in tandem with priesthood and auxiliary leaders and take full advantage of the Church s youth and family programs Remember another of President Lee s insightful phrases that the Church is the scaffolding with which we build eternal families see Teachings Harold B Lee 148 Now if for any reason you individually or as a family have lost your way then you need only apply the Savior s teachings from Luke chapter 15 to correct your course Here the Savior tells of the effort of a shepherd searching for his lost sheep of a woman searching for a lost coin and of the welcome received by the prodigal son returning home Why did Jesus teach these parables He wanted us to know that none of us will ever be so lost that we cannot find our way again through His Atonement and His teachings As you seek to live the gospel and doctrine of Christ the Holy Ghost will guide you and your family You will have a spiritual GPS to tell you always where you are and where you are going I bear witness that the resurrected Redeemer of mankind loves all of us and He has promised if we will follow Him He will lead us safely back into the presence of our Heavenly Father of which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Elder Hales on behalf of all of us we extend our deepest love and are so grateful you are here this morning Since last April s general conference my mind has repeatedly focused on the subject of the importance of a name In these past few months several great grandchildren have come into our family Although they seem to come faster than I can keep up with each child is a welcome addition to our family Each has received a special name chosen by his or her parents a name to be known by throughout his or her lifetime distinguishing him or her from anyone else This is true in every family and it is also true among the religions of the world The Lord Jesus Christ knew how important it was to clearly name His Church in these latter days In the 115th section of the Doctrine and Covenants He Himself named the Church For thus shall my church be called in the last days even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints verse 4 And King Benjamin taught his people in Book of Mormon times I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives And I would that ye should remember also that this is the name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out except it be through transgression therefore take heed that ye do not transgress that the name be not blotted out of your hearts Mosiah 5 8 11 We take the name of Christ upon us in the waters of baptism We renew the effect of that baptism each week as we partake of the sacrament signifying our willingness to take His name upon us and promising always to remember Him see D C 20 77 79 Do we realize how blessed we are to take upon us the name of God s Beloved and Only Begotten Son Do we understand how significant that is The Savior s name is the only name under heaven by which man can be saved see 2 Nephi 31 21 As you will remember President Boyd K Packer discussed the importance of the name of the Church in last April s general conference He explained that obedient to revelation we call ourselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints rather than the Mormon Church Guided by the Holy Spirit Liahona and Ensign May 2011 30 Because the full name of the Church is so important I echo the revelations from the scriptures the First Presidency s instructions in letters of 1982 and 2001 and the words of other Apostles who have encouraged the members of the Church to uphold and teach the world that the Church is known by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ This is the name by which the Lord will call us at the last day It is the name by which His Church will be distinguished from all others I have thought a lot about why the Savior gave the nine word name to His restored Church It may seem long but if we think of it as a descriptive overview of what the Church is it suddenly becomes wonderfully brief candid and straightforward How could any description be more direct and clear and yet expressed in such few words Every word is clarifying and indispensable The word The indicates the unique position of the restored Church among the religions of the world The words Church of Jesus Christ declare that it is His Church In the Book of Mormon Jesus taught And how be it my church save it be called in my name For if a church be called in Moses name then it be Moses church or if it be called in the name of a man like Mormon then it be the church of a man but if it be called in my name then it is my church if it so be that they are built upon my gospel 3 Nephi 27 8 Of Latter day explains that it is the same Church as the Church that Jesus Christ established during His mortal ministry but restored in these latter days We know there was a falling away or an apostasy necessitating the Restoration of His true and complete Church in our time Saints means that its members follow Him and strive to do His will keep His commandments and prepare once again to live with Him and our Heavenly Father in the future Saint simply refers to those who seek to make their lives holy by covenanting to follow Christ The name the Savior has given to His Church tells us exactly who we are and what we believe We believe that Jesus Christ is the Savior and the Redeemer of the world He atoned for all who would repent of their sins and He broke the bands of death and provided the resurrection from the dead We follow Jesus Christ And as King Benjamin said to his people so I reaffirm to all of us today Ye should remember to retain His name written always in your hearts Mosiah 5 12 We are asked to stand as a witness of Him at all times and in all things and in all places Mosiah 18 9 This means that we must be willing to let others know whom we follow and to whose Church we belong the Church of Jesus Christ We certainly want to do this in the spirit of love and testimony We want to follow the Savior by simply and clearly yet humbly declaring that we are members of His Church We follow Him by being Latter day Saints latter day disciples People and organizations are often given nicknames by others A nickname may be a shortened form of a name or it may be derived from an event or some physical or other characteristic While nicknames do not have the same status or significance as actual names they can be properly used The Lord s Church in both ancient and modern times has had nicknames The Saints in New Testament times were called Christians because they professed a belief in Jesus Christ That name first used derogatorily by their detractors is now a name of distinction and we are honored to be called a Christian church Our members have been called Mormons because we believe in the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ Others may try to use the word Mormon more broadly to include and refer to those who have left the Church and formed various splinter groups Such use only leads to confusion We are grateful for the efforts of the media to refrain from using the word Mormon in a way that may cause the public to confuse the Church with polygamists or other fundamentalist groups Let me state clearly that no polygamist group including those calling themselves fundamentalist Mormons or other derivatives of our name has any affiliation whatsoever with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints While Mormon is not the full and correct name of the Church and even though it was originally given by our detractors during our early years of persecution it has become an acceptable nickname when applied to members rather than the institution We do not need to stop using the name Mormon when appropriate but we should continue to give emphasis to the full and correct name of the Church itself In other words we should avoid and discourage the term Mormon Church Through the years as I have filled assignments around the world I have been asked many times if I belong to the Mormon Church My response has been I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ Because we believe in the Book of Mormon which is named after an ancient American prophet leader and is another testament of Jesus Christ we are sometimes called Mormons In every instance this response has been well received and in fact has opened up opportunities for me to explain the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel in these latter days Brothers and sisters just think of what an impact we can have by simply responding by using the full name of the Church as the Lord has declared we should do And if you cannot immediately use the full name at least say I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ and later explain of Latter day Saints Some may ask what about the Internet sites such as Mormon org as well as various Church initiated media campaigns As I said referring collectively to members as Mormons is sometimes appropriate As a practical matter those outside of our faith come looking for us searching for that term But once you open up Mormon org the proper name of the Church is explained on the home page and it appears on each additional page on the site It is impractical to expect people to type the full name of the Church when seeking to find us or when logging on to our website While these practicalities may continue they should not keep members from using the full name of the Church whenever possible Let us develop the habit within our families and our Church activities and our daily interactions of making it clear that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is the name by which the Lord Himself has directed that we be known A recent opinion poll indicated that far too many people still do not understand correctly that Mormon refers to members of our Church And a majority of people are still not sure that Mormons are Christian Even when they read of our Helping Hands work throughout the world in response to hurricanes earthquakes floods and famines they do not associate our humanitarian efforts with us as a Christian organization Surely it would be easier for them to understand that we believe in and follow the Savior if we referred to ourselves as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints In this way those who hear the name Mormon will come to associate that word with our revealed name and with people who follow Jesus Christ As the First Presidency asked in their letter of February 23 2001 The use of the revealed name The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is increasingly important in our responsibility to proclaim the name of the Savior throughout all the world Accordingly we ask that when we refer to the Church we use its full name wherever possible Back in 1948 at the October general conference President George Albert Smith said Brethren and sisters when you go away from here you may be associating with various denominations of the world but remember that there is only one Church in all the world that by divine command bears the name of Jesus Christ our Lord in Conference Report Oct 1948 167 Brothers and sisters may we also remember this as we leave conference today Let our testimonies of Him be heard and our love for Him always be in our hearts I humbly pray in His name the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters I hope those of you visiting Salt Lake will take the opportunity to enjoy the colors and fragrances of the beautiful spring flowers on Temple Square Spring brings a renewal of light and life reminding us through the cycle of seasons of the life sacrifice and Resurrection of our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ for all things bear record of Him Moses 6 63 Against this beautiful backdrop of spring and its symbolism of hope there is a world of uncertainty complexity and confusion The demands of everyday life education jobs raising children Church administration and callings worldly activities and even the pain and sorrow of unexpected illness and tragedy can wear us down How can we free ourselves from this tangled web of challenges and uncertainties to find peace of mind and happiness Oftentimes we are like the young merchant from Boston who in 1849 as the story goes was caught up in the fervor of the California gold rush He sold all of his possessions to seek his fortune in the California rivers which he was told were filled with gold nuggets so big that one could hardly carry them Day after endless day the young man dipped his pan into the river and came up empty His only reward was a growing pile of rocks Discouraged and broke he was ready to quit until one day an old experienced prospector said to him That s quite a pile of rocks you are getting there my boy The young man replied There s no gold here I m going back home Walking over to the pile of rocks the old prospector said Oh there is gold all right You just have to know where to find it He picked two rocks up in his hands and crashed them together One of the rocks split open revealing several flecks of gold sparkling in the sunlight Noticing a bulging leather pouch fastened to the prospector s waist the young man said I m looking for nuggets like the ones in your pouch not just tiny flecks The old prospector extended his pouch toward the young man who looked inside expecting to see several large nuggets He was stunned to see that the pouch was filled with thousands of flecks of gold The old prospector said Son it seems to me you are so busy looking for large nuggets that you re missing filling your pouch with these precious flecks of gold The patient accumulation of these little flecks has brought me great wealth This story illustrates the spiritual truth that Alma taught his son Helaman By small and simple things are great things brought to pass And by very small means the Lord bringeth about the salvation of many souls Alma 37 6 7 Brothers and sisters the gospel of Jesus Christ is simple no matter how much we try to make it complicated We should strive to keep our lives similarly simple unencumbered by extraneous influences focused on those things that matter most What are the precious simple things of the gospel that bring clarity and purpose to our lives What are the flecks of gospel gold whose patient accumulation over the course of our lifetime will reward us with the ultimate treasure the precious gift of eternal life I believe there is one simple but profound even sublime principle that encompasses the entirety of the gospel of Jesus Christ If we wholeheartedly embrace this principle and make it the focus of our lives it will purify and sanctify us so we can live once again in the presence of God The Savior spoke of this principle when He answered the Pharisee who asked Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind This is the first and great commandment And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself Matthew 22 36 40 It is only when we love God and Christ with all of our hearts souls and minds that we are able to share this love with our neighbors through acts of kindness and service the way that the Savior would love and serve all of us if He were among us today When this pure love of Christ or charity envelops us we think feel and act more like Heavenly Father and Jesus would think feel and act Our motivation and heartfelt desire are like unto that of the Savior He shared this desire with His Apostles on the eve of His Crucifixion He said A new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another as I have loved you By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another John 13 34 35 The love the Savior described is an active love It is not manifested through large and heroic deeds but rather through simple acts of kindness and service There are myriad ways and circumstances in which we can serve and love others May I suggest just a few First charity begins at home The single most important principle that should govern every home is to practice the Golden Rule the Lord s admonition that all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them Matthew 7 12 Take a moment and imagine how you would feel if you were on the receiving end of thoughtless words or actions By our example let us teach our family members to have love one for another Another place where we have ample opportunity to serve is in the Church Our wards and branches should be places where the Golden Rule always guides our words and actions toward each other By treating each other kindly speaking words of support and encouragement and being sensitive to each other s needs we can create loving unity among ward members Where charity exists there is no place for gossip or unkind words Ward members both adults and youth can unite in meaningful service to bless the lives of others Just two weeks ago the President of the South America Northwest Area Elder Marcus B Nash of the Seventy reported that by assigning the strong in spirit to those that are weak they are rescuing hundreds of less active adults and youth Through love and service one by one they are coming back These acts of kindness create a strong and lasting bond among everyone involved both the helpers and the helpees So many precious memories are centered around such service When I think back on my many years of Church administration some of my most profound memories are the times I joined with ward members to help someone For example I remember as a bishop working alongside several active members of my ward as we cleaned out the silage pit at the stake welfare farm This was not a pleasant assignment A less active brother who had not been to church for many years was invited to join with us Because of the love and fellowship he felt with us as we worked and talked in that smelly silage pit he came back to church and was later sealed in the temple to his wife and his children Our fellowship through service has blessed his children grandchildren and now great grandchildren Many of them have served missions have married in the temple and are raising an eternal family a great work wrought by a simple act a small fleck of gold A third area where we can serve is in our communities As a pure expression of our love and concern we can reach out to those who have need of our help Many of you have put on Helping Hands T shirts and worked tirelessly to relieve suffering and improve your communities Young single adults in the Sendai Japan Stake recently provided invaluable service in searching for members in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami There are countless ways to serve Through our heartfelt kindness and service we can make friends with those whom we serve From these friendships come better understanding of our devotion to the gospel and a desire to learn more about us My good friend Elder Joseph B Wirthlin talked of the power of this principle when he said Kindness is the essence of greatness It is a passport that opens doors and fashions friends It softens hearts and molds relationships that can last lifetimes The Virtue of Kindness Liahona and Ensign May 2005 26 Another way we can serve Heavenly Father s children is through missionary service not only as full time missionaries but also as friends and neighbors The future growth of the Church will not happen through just knocking on strangers doors It will happen when the members along with our missionaries filled with the love of God and Christ discern needs and respond to those needs in the spirit of charitable service When we do this brothers and sisters the honest in heart will feel our sincerity and our love Many will want to know more about us Then and only then will the Church expand to fill all of the earth This cannot be accomplished by missionaries alone but requires the interest and service of every member In all of our service we need to be sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost The still small voice will let us know who needs our help and what we can do to help them President Spencer W Kimball said It is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom So often our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving help with mundane tasks but what glorious consequences can flow from small but deliberate deeds Teachings of Presidents of the Church Spencer W Kimball 2006 82 And President Thomas S Monson has counseled The needs of others are ever present and each of us can do something to help someone Unless we lose ourselves in service to others there is little purpose to our own lives What Have I Done for Someone Today Liahona and Ensign Nov 2009 85 Brothers and sisters may I reemphasize that the most important attribute of Heavenly Father and of His Beloved Son that we should desire and seek to possess within our lives is the gift of charity the pure love of Christ Moroni 7 47 From this gift springs our capacity to love and to serve others as the Savior did The prophet Mormon taught us the supreme importance of this gift and told us how we can receive it Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ that ye may become the sons of God that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that we may have this hope that we may be purified even as he is pure Moroni 7 48 Great things are wrought through simple and small things Like the small flecks of gold that accumulate over time into a large treasure our small and simple acts of kindness and service will accumulate into a life filled with love for Heavenly Father devotion to the work of the Lord Jesus Christ and a sense of peace and joy each time we reach out to one another As we approach the Easter season may we show our love and appreciation for the Savior s atoning sacrifice through our simple compassionate acts of service to our brothers and sisters at home at church and in our communities For this I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters the advent of the fall season here in the Rocky Mountains brings with it the glorious colors of leaves transforming from green to blazing oranges reds and yellows During the fall all nature is in a state of transition preparing for the cold austere beauty of winter Autumn is a particularly exciting time for the fly fishermen for this is the time trout are driven by an almost insatiable hunger to feast in order to fortify their bodies against the scarcity of winter food The goal of the fly fisherman is to catch trout through skillful deception The adept fisherman studies trout behavior weather the water current and the types of insects trout eat and when those insects hatch He will often craft by hand the lures he uses He knows these artificial insects embedded with tiny hooks need to be a perfect deception because the trout will identify even the slightest flaw and reject the fly What a thrill it is to watch a trout break the surface of the water inhale the fly and resist until it is finally exhausted and reeled in The test is the pitting of the fisherman s knowledge and skill against the noble trout The use of artificial lures to fool and catch a fish is an example of the way Lucifer often tempts deceives and tries to ensnare us Like the fly fisherman who knows that trout are driven by hunger Lucifer knows our hunger or weaknesses and tempts us with counterfeit lures which if taken can cause us to be yanked from the stream of life into his unmerciful influence And unlike a fly fisherman who catches and releases the fish unharmed back into the water Lucifer will not voluntarily let go His goal is to make his victims as miserable as he is Lehi said And because he Lucifer had fallen from heaven and had become miserable forever he sought also the misery of all mankind 2 Nephi 2 18 I add my voice today to the voices of my Brethren that Lucifer is a clever and cunning intelligence One of the main methods he uses against us is his ability to lie and deceive to convince us that evil is good and good is evil Right from the very beginning in the great Council in Heaven Satan sought to destroy the agency of man which I the Lord God had given him And he became Satan yea even the devil the father of all lies to deceive and to blind men and to lead them captive at his will Moses 4 3 4 The battle over man s God given agency continues today Satan and his minions have their lures all around us hoping that we will falter and take his flies so he can reel us in with counterfeit means He uses addiction to steal away agency According to the dictionary addiction of any kind means to surrender to something thus relinquishing agency and becoming dependent on some life destroying substance or behavior 1Researchers tell us there is a mechanism in our brain called the pleasure center 2 When activated by certain drugs or behaviors it overpowers the part of our brain that governs our willpower judgment logic and morality This leads the addict to abandon what he or she knows is right And when that happens the hook is set and Lucifer takes control Satan knows how to exploit and ensnare us with artificial substances and behaviors of temporary pleasure I have observed the impact when one struggles to win back control to become free from destructive abuse and addiction and to regain self esteem and independence Some of the most addictive drugs that if abused can hijack the brain and take away one s agency include nicotine opiates heroin morphine and other painkillers tranquilizers cocaine alcohol marijuana and methamphetamines I am grateful for doctors who are trained to prescribe proper medications to relieve pain and suffering Unfortunately too many in our communities today including some of our own members become addicted to and then abuse prescription medications Lucifer the father of all lies knows this and uses his influence to steal away one s agency and capture the abuser with his awful chains see 2 Nephi 28 22 Recently I talked to a sister who was in the psychiatric unit of a local hospital She shared with me her sorrowful journey from complete mental and physical health a wonderful marriage and family into mental illness debilitating health and the breakup of her family all of which started with the abuse of prescription painkillers Two years prior to our conversation she hurt her back in a car accident Her doctor prescribed a medication to relieve the almost unbearable pain She thought she needed something more so she forged prescriptions and finally resorted to buying heroin This led to her arrest and incarceration Her obsession with drugs caused her marriage to fail Her husband divorced her and retained custody of the children She told me that besides helping to dull her pain the drugs also provided a short term but heightened sense of euphoria and well being But each dosage of drugs lasted only a few hours and with each use the duration of relief seemed to lessen She began to take more and more of the drugs and got caught up in the vicious cycle of addiction Drugs became her life The night before I talked with her she tried to commit suicide She said she could no longer deal with the physical emotional and spiritual pain She felt trapped with no way out with no hope This sister s problem with prescription and other drug abuse is not unique it is happening all around us In some places more people die from prescription drug abuse than die from automobile accidents 3 Brothers and sisters stay away from any kind of substance that may trap you Even one sniff of something or one pill or one drink of alcohol can lead to addiction A recovering alcoholic told me that just one drink is the difference between addiction and sobriety Satan knows this Do not let him hook you with his artificial lures that can quickly turn into addiction Now brothers and sisters please don t misunderstand what I am saying I m not questioning prescription medications for those suffering with treatable illness or great physical pain They are indeed a blessing What I am saying is that we need to carefully follow the doses prescribed by doctors And we need to keep such medications in a safe place where youngsters or anyone else cannot gain access to them There is also great concern about some of the pernicious addictive behaviors like gambling and evil pornography that are so personally destructive and so rampant in our society Remember brothers and sisters any kind of addiction is to surrender to something thus relinquishing agency and becoming dependent Thus video gaming and texting on cell phones need to be added to the list Some gamers claim to spend up to 18 hours a day going through level after level of video games neglecting all other aspects of their lives Texting on cell phones can become an addiction causing the important interpersonal human communication to become lost Not long ago a bishop told me two of his youth were standing side by side texting one another rather than talking to each other Medical research describes addiction as a disease of the brain 4 This is true but I believe that once Satan has someone in his grasp it also becomes a disease of the spirit But no matter what addictive cycle one is caught in there is always hope The prophet Lehi taught his sons this eternal truth Wherefore men are free according to the flesh and all things are given them which are expedient unto man And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life through the great Mediator of all men or to choose captivity and death according to the captivity and power of the devil 2 Nephi 2 27 If anyone who is addicted has a desire to overcome then there is a way to spiritual freedom a way to escape from bondage a way that is proven It begins with prayer sincere fervent and constant communication with the Creator of our spirits and bodies our Heavenly Father It is the same principle in breaking a bad habit or repenting from sin of any kind The formula for having our heart our body our mind and our spirit transformed is found in the scriptures The prophet Mormon counseled us Wherefore my beloved brethren pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart that ye may be filled with this love that ye may become the sons of God that we may be purified even as he is pure Moroni 7 48 This and many other scriptures testify to us there is hope for the addicted and this hope comes through the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ and by humbling oneself before God pleading to be freed of the bondage of addiction and offering our whole soul to Him in fervent prayer Priesthood leaders can help as those with addictions seek counsel from them Where necessary they can refer them to qualified licensed counselors and LDS Family Services The addiction recovery program adapted from the original 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous is readily available through LDS Family Services To those who are dealing with an addiction personally or within your family I repeat fervent prayer is key to gaining the spiritual strength to find peace and overcome an addictive craving Heavenly Father loves all of His children so thank Him and express sincere faith in Him Ask Him for the strength to overcome the addiction you are experiencing Set aside all pride and turn your life and your heart to Him Ask to be filled with the power of Christ s pure love You may have to do this many times but I testify to you that your body mind and spirit can be transformed cleansed and made whole and you will be freed Jesus said I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life John 8 12 Because our goal is to become more like our Savior and to eventually qualify to live with our Heavenly Father each of us needs to experience the mighty change in our hearts described by the prophet Alma in the Book of Mormon see Alma 5 14 Our love for our Father in Heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ needs to be reflected in our daily choices and actions They have promised peace joy and happiness to those who keep Their commandments Brothers and sisters may we all be aware of the artificial flies being presented to us by the counterfeit fisher of men Lucifer May we have the wisdom and spiritual insight to discern and refuse his many dangerous offerings And for those of you who have fallen prey to any kind of addiction there is hope because God loves all of His children and because the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ makes all things possible I have seen the marvelous blessing of recovery that can set one free from the chains of addiction The Lord is our Shepherd and we shall not want as we trust in the power of the Atonement I know the Lord can and will free the addicted from their bondage for as the Apostle Paul proclaimed I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me Philippians 4 13 I pray my brothers and sisters that this may be so with those who may be struggling with this challenge at this time in their lives and do so humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters six months ago I spoke in the priesthood session of general conference to fathers and sons As you might expect my 5 daughters 24 granddaughters and ever increasing number of great granddaughters have been asking for equal time So today I will speak primarily to the mothers and daughters of the Church My dear wife Barbara has had an eternally significant influence on our daughters and granddaughters and they in turn on her Mothers and daughters play a critical role in helping each other explore their infinite possibilities despite the undermining influences of a world in which womanhood and motherhood are being corrupted and manipulated Speaking to the women of the Church nearly a century ago President Joseph F Smith said It is not for you to be led by the women of the world it is for you to lead the women of the world in everything that is praise worthy everything that is God like everything that is uplifting and purifying to the children of men Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph F Smith 1998 184 Sisters we your brethren cannot do what you were divinely designated to do from before the foundation of the world We may try but we cannot ever hope to replicate your unique gifts There is nothing in this world as personal as nurturing or as life changing as the influence of a righteous woman I understand that some of you young women do not have mothers with whom you can discuss these issues And many of you women do not presently have daughters in your lives But because all women have within their divine nature both the inherent talent and the stewardship to mother most of what I will say applies equally to grandmothers aunts sisters stepmothers mothers in law leaders and other mentors who sometimes fill the gaps for these significant mother daughter relationships Young women your mothers adore you They see in you the promise of future generations Everything you accomplish every challenge you overcome brings them pure joy And likewise your worries and heartaches are their worries and heartaches Today I wish to give you young women some suggestions on how to take full advantage of your relationship with your mother And then I have a few thoughts to share with mothers about how they can maximize their influence with their daughters as well as the other members of their families It is unfortunately all too easy to illustrate the confusion and distortion of womanhood in contemporary society Immodest immoral intemperate women jam the airwaves monopolize magazines and slink across movie screens all while being celebrated by the world The Apostle Paul spoke prophetically of perilous times that will come in the last days and specifically referenced something that may have seemed particularly perilous to him silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts 2 Timothy 3 1 6 Popular culture today often makes women look silly inconsequential mindless and powerless It objectifies them and disrespects them and then suggests that they are able to leave their mark on mankind only by seduction easily the most pervasively dangerous message the adversary sends to women about themselves And so my dear young women with all my heart I urge you not to look to contemporary culture for your role models and mentors Please look to your faithful mothers for a pattern to follow Model yourselves after them not after celebrities whose standards are not the Lord s standards and whose values may not reflect an eternal perspective Look to your mother Learn from her strengths her courage and her faithfulness Listen to her She may not be a whiz at texting she may not even have a Facebook page But when it comes to matters of the heart and the things of the Lord she has a wealth of knowledge As you approach the time for marriage and young motherhood she will be your greatest source of wisdom No other person on earth loves you in the same way or is willing to sacrifice as much to encourage you and help you find happiness in this life and forever Love your mother my young sisters Respect her Listen to her Trust her She has your best interests at heart She cares about your eternal safety and happiness So be kind to her Be patient with her imperfections for she has them We all do Now may I share a few thoughts with you mothers about the special role you play in your daughters lives We have a family friend who travels often with members of her extended family Her primary observation after each trip is how much the young women behave like their mothers If the mothers are thrifty so are their daughters If the mothers are modest so are the girls If the mothers wear flip flops and other casual clothing to sacrament meeting so do their daughters Mothers your example is extremely important to your daughters even if they don t acknowledge it Throughout the history of the world women have always been teachers of moral values That instruction begins in the cradle and continues throughout the lives of their children Today our society is bombarded with messages about womanhood and motherhood that are dangerously and wickedly wrong Following these messages can put your daughters on the path to sin and self destruction Your daughters may not understand that unless you tell them or better unless you show them how to make good choices As mothers in Israel you are your daughters first line of defense against the wiles of the world Now mothers I understand that it sometimes appears that our children aren t paying attention to the lessons we re trying to teach them Believe me I ve seen that glazed over look that comes to the eyes of teenagers just when you re coming to what you think is the best part of your instruction Let me assure you that even when you think your daughter is not listening to a thing you say she is still learning from you as she watches you to see if your actions match your words As Ralph Waldo Emerson is believed to have said What you do speaks so loud that I cannot hear what you say see Ralph Keyes The Quote Verifier 2006 56 Teach your daughters to find joy in nurturing children This is where their love and talents can have the greatest eternal significance Consider in this context President Harold B Lee s injunction that the most important work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes Teachings of Presidents of the Church Harold B Lee 2000 134 This is true for all of us of course but it is especially powerful when considering the relationship of mothers and daughters Mothers teach your daughters that a faithful daughter of God avoids the temptation to gossip or judge one another In a sermon to the Relief Society of Nauvoo the Prophet Joseph counseled The tongue is an unruly member hold your tongues about things of no moment Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph Smith 2007 455 In recent years there has been a rash of articles books and films written about women and girls who gossip and who are mean Satan is always attempting to undermine the most precious element of a woman s divine nature the nature to nurture A mother daughter relationship is where a daughter learns how to nurture by being nurtured She is loved She is taught and experiences firsthand what it feels like to have someone care about her enough to correct her while continuing to encourage and believe in her at the same time Remember sisters God is the source of all moral and spiritual power We gain access to that power by entering into covenants with Him and keeping those covenants Mothers teach your daughters the importance of making covenants and then show them how to keep those covenants in such a way that they will desire to live worthy to go to the temple In today s world this means talking to your daughters about sexual matters Your daughters as well as your sons are coming of age in a world that openly embraces early casual and thoughtless promiscuity Immodest unchaste women are glamorized and all too often celebrated and emulated While there are steps that we can take in our homes and families to minimize our exposure to these unsavory elements of contemporary living your daughters cannot entirely avoid the blatant sexual messages and enticements that surround them You need to have frequent open discussions during which you teach your daughters the truth about these issues For example they need to understand that when they wear clothing that is too tight too short or too low cut they not only can send the wrong message to young men with whom they associate but they also perpetuate in their own minds the fallacy that a woman s value is dependent solely upon her sensual appeal This never has been nor will it ever be within the righteous definition of a faithful daughter of God They need to hear this clearly and repeatedly from your lips and they need to see it modeled correctly and consistently in your own personal standards of dress grooming and modest living All youth will be more likely to make and keep covenants if they learn how to recognize the presence and the voice of the Spirit Teach your daughters about things of the Spirit Point them to the scriptures Give them experiences that will help them cherish the blessing of priesthood power in their lives Through keeping covenants they will learn to hear the voice of the Lord and receive personal revelation God will truly hear and answer their prayers The Mutual theme for 2010 applies to our youth as well as to all of us Be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest Joshua 1 9 This will lead them safely to the blessings of the house of the Lord Make sure they know that keeping covenants is the safest road to eternal happiness And if needed teach them how to repent and how to remain pure and worthy Now if this has a familiar sound my brothers and sisters it s because I ve been speaking to parents and their children for three general conferences in a row Last April I encouraged the youth to learn the lessons of the past From that talk I quote When you are willing to listen and learn some of life s most meaningful teachings come from those who have gone before you How much better your life will be if you will follow the noble example of the faithful followers of Christ Learning the Lessons of the Past Liahona and Ensign May 2009 31 33 Last October I spoke to fathers and sons in priesthood meeting and today I have spoken mostly to mothers and daughters In each case my message has been different but similar I hope you are listening and see a pattern and hear a steady consistent message that in these last days it is essential even critical that parents and children listen to and learn from one another These are not just ethereal concepts about which I have been speaking They are the essence the center of God s plan for our eternal happiness and peace The Church will help wherever we can We are there to support and sustain you as parents and as children But the home is the most important place to prepare the youth of today to lead the families and the Church of tomorrow It rests upon each one of us as mothers and fathers to do all we can to prepare our youth to be faithful righteous men and women It is in the home where we must teach the gospel by precept and by example I conclude my counsel with this prophetic summary from President Joseph F Smith Our family associations are not exclusively intended for this life for time as we distinguish it from eternity We live for time and for eternity We form associations and relations for time and all eternity Who are there besides the Latter day Saints who contemplate the thought that beyond the grave we will continue in the family organization the father the mother the children recognizing each other this family organization being a unit in the great and perfect organization of God s work and all destined to continue throughout time and eternity Teachings Joseph F Smith 385 386 May God bless us to teach nurture and prepare one another within the walls of our homes for the great work that must be done by all of us now and in the future is my prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
It is a wonderful sight to see all of you fathers sitting shoulder to shoulder with your sons to listen to the teachings of the Lord and receive counsel from the General Authorities of the Church It is always a joy to be united with men and young men of the priesthood but there is something special about seeing fathers and sons here together It is a visual reminder of two of the most powerful elements of our theology priesthood and family The priesthood is the divine power through which families are sealed together forever Everything in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ including the ordinances of the holy temple is focused on the possibilities of families becoming part of the eternal family of God Tonight I want to talk to you fathers and sons about how you talk to each other There is no other relationship quite like that which can and should exist between a boy and his dad It can be one of the most nurturing joyful relationships in life one that can have a profound impact on who boys become and also on who dads become Now I understand that some of you young men do not have fathers with whom you can have these kinds of conversations And some of you men do not have sons or have lost your sons to accident or illness But much of what I say tonight will apply to uncles and grandfathers and priesthood leaders and other mentors who sometimes fill the gaps for these significant father son relationships You see we re all on a journey Dads are a little further down the road but none of us has yet arrived at our final destination We are all in the process of becoming who we will one day be Fathers and sons can play a critical role in helping each other become the best that they can be I know that father son relationships are never perfect but everything I am going to suggest to you tonight is possible if you will put in the effort to make it happen Young men you are your father s pride and joy In you they see a promising future and their hope for a better improved version of themselves Your accomplishments are a joy to them Your worries and problems are their worries and problems Fathers you are the primary model of manhood for your sons You are their most meaningful mentor and believe it or not you are their hero in countless ways Your words and your example are a great influence on them Tonight I want to give you young men three simple suggestions on how to take full advantage of your relationship with your dad And then I want to give you fathers three suggestions about relating to and communicating with your sons To you Aaronic Priesthood holders I believe that by doing these three simple things you can make your relationship with your father even better than it is right now First trust your father He is not perfect but he loves you and would never do anything he didn t think was in your best interest So talk to him Share your thoughts and feelings your dreams and your fears The more he knows about your life the better chance he has to understand your concerns and to give you good counsel When you put your trust in your dad he will feel the responsibility of that trust and try harder than ever to understand and to help As your father he is entitled to inspiration on your behalf His advice to you will be the heartfelt expressions of someone who knows and loves you Your dad wants more than anything for you to be happy and successful so why would you not want to trust someone like that Boys trust your dad Second take an interest in your father s life Ask about his job his interests his goals How did he decide to do the work that he does What was he like when he was your age How did he meet your mother And as you learn more about him you may find that his experiences help you to better understand why he responds the way that he does Watch your dad Watch how he treats your mother Watch how he performs his Church callings Watch how he interacts with other people You will be surprised what you learn about him just by watching him and listening to him Think about what you don t know about him and find out Your love admiration and understanding will increase by what you learn Boys be interested in your dad s life And third ask your father for advice Let s be honest he is probably going to give you his advice whether you ask for it or not but it just works so much better when you ask Ask for his advice on Church activity on classes on friends on school on dating on sports or other hobbies Ask for his counsel on your Church assignments on preparing for your mission on decisions or choices you have to make Nothing shows respect for another person as much as asking for his advice because what you are really saying when you ask for advice is I appreciate what you know and the experiences you have had and I value your ideas and suggestions Those are nice things for a father to hear from his son In my experience fathers who are asked for advice try harder to give good sound useful counsel By asking your father for advice you not only receive the benefit of his input but you also provide him with a little extra motivation to strive to be a better father and a better man He will think more carefully about whatever it is that he advises and he will work harder to walk the talk Young men ask your dad for advice OK fathers now it s your turn Let s talk about some things you can do to enhance your relationship with your sons You will notice that there is some linkage between the three suggestions I am going to give you and the suggestions I just gave your sons That isn t coincidental First fathers listen to your sons really listen to them Ask the right kind of questions and listen to what your sons have to say each time you have a few minutes together You need to know not to guess but to know what is going on in your son s life Don t assume that you know how he feels just because you were young once Your sons live in a very different world from the one in which you grew up As they share with you what s going on you will have to listen very carefully and without being judgmental in order to understand what they are thinking and experiencing Find your own best way to connect Some fathers like to take their sons fishing or to a sporting event Others like to go on a quiet drive or work side by side in the yard Some find their sons enjoy conversations at night just before going to bed Do whatever works best for you A one on one relationship should be a routine part of your stewardship with your sons Every father needs at least one focused quality conversation with his sons every month during which they talk about specific things such as school friends feelings video games text messaging worthiness faith and testimony Where or when this happens isn t nearly as important as the fact that it happens And oh how fathers need to listen Remember conversation where you do 90 percent of the talking is not a conversation Use the word feel as often as you comfortably can in your discussions with your sons Ask How do you feel about what you re learning in that class How do you feel about what your friend said How do you feel about your priesthood and the Church Don t think you have to try to fix everything or solve everything during these visits Most of the time the best thing you can do is just listen Fathers who listen more than they talk find that their sons share more about what is really going on in their lives Dads listen to your sons Second pray with and for your sons Give them priesthood blessings A son who is worried about a big exam or a special event will surely benefit from a father s priesthood blessing Occasions like the start of a new school year a birthday or as he begins to date may be opportune times to call upon the Lord to bless your son One on one prayer and the sharing of testimonies can draw you closer to each other as well as closer to the Lord I am mindful that many of you fathers suffer heartache over sons who have strayed and are being captured by the world just as Alma and Mosiah worried about their sons Continue to do all you can to maintain strong family relationships Never give up even when fervent prayer in their behalf is all you can do These precious sons of yours are your sons forever Fathers pray with and bless your sons Third dare to have the big talks with your sons You know what I mean talks about drugs and drinking about the dangers of today s media the Internet cyber technologies and pornography and about priesthood worthiness respect for girls and moral cleanliness While these should not be the only subjects you talk about with your sons please don t shy away from them Your boys need your counsel guidance and input on these subjects As you talk about these very important matters you will find that the trust between you will flourish I am especially concerned that we communicate openly and clearly with our sons about sexual matters Your sons are growing up in a world that openly embraces and flaunts early casual and thoughtless promiscuity Your sons simply cannot avoid the blatant sexual imagery messages and enticements that are all around them Fathers and Church leaders need to have open and frequent discussions that teach and clarify how young men of the priesthood handle this issue Be positive about how wonderful and beautiful physical intimacy can be when it happens within the bounds the Lord has set including temple covenants and commitments of eternal marriage Studies show that the biggest deterrent to casual sexual activity is a wholesome attitude that connects such personal relationships with genuine commitment and mature love Fathers if you have not had this big talk with your sons please do so and do it soon Now in closing I want to talk to all of you returned missionaries Everything that I have said tonight also applies to you Trust your father You can be closer to him now than ever before regardless of what your relationship was like before your mission During the next few years you will make the most important decisions of your life Along with prayer to your Heavenly Father advice from your earthly father can help you make those decisions concerning your education career choice and marriage The most important decision you will make in this life is the decision to marry the right girl in the temple While no one should rush this significant decision all returned missionaries should be working on it Be where you can meet the right kind of friends And go on dates Hanging out is not the way nor is it enough Courting seems to be a lost art Rediscover it It really works Ask your fathers they know Do not drift to the ways of the world Rather maintain the dignity and the Spirit you enjoyed on your mission The Church will need your leadership in the future And fathers the three suggestions I made to you moments ago absolutely apply to your relationships with your returned missionary sons Listen to them and connect with them in regular focused conversation Talk with them in depth about their feelings and desires Pray with them and give them blessings as they face the important decisions in their future I m grateful for my sons and my sons in law who have taught me so much and I pray now that our Heavenly Father will bless all of us as fathers and sons that we will honor our priesthood and that we will love one another by making relationships with each other one of the great eternal priorities of our lives I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
We live in a fascinating and sometimes bewildering time The other day I mentioned to one of my grandsons that I was going over the text of my conference talk His face reflected his confusion You re going to text your conference talk he asked I thought you had to give it in the Conference Center While for some texting would be easier I m grateful for this opportunity today to speak because I have a message I feel is important for that grandson and for my other grandchildren as well as for all of the youth of the Church Years ago when I was in business I learned a very expensive lesson because I did not listen carefully to the counsel of my father nor did I heed the promptings of the Spirit giving me guidance from my Heavenly Father My father and I were in the automobile business and the Ford Motor Company was looking for dealers to sell their new line of cars Ford executives invited my father and me to a preview showing of what they thought would be a spectacularly successful product When we saw the cars my father who had over 35 years experience in the business cautioned me about becoming a dealer However the Ford sales personnel were very persuasive and I chose to become Salt Lake City s first and actually last Edsel dealer And if you don t know what an Edsel is ask your grandpa He will tell you that the Edsel was a spectacular failure Now there s a powerful lesson for all of you in this experience When you are willing to listen and learn some of life s most meaningful teachings come from those who have gone before you They have walked where you are walking and have experienced many of the things you are experiencing If you listen and respond to their counsel they can help guide you toward choices that will be for your benefit and blessing and steer you away from decisions that can destroy you As you look to your parents and others who have gone before you you will find examples of faith commitment hard work dedication and sacrifice that you should strive to duplicate It s hard to imagine a scenario in which it would not be worthwhile to consider and learn from the experience of others Many professions require internships during which aspiring professionals shadow seasoned veterans to learn from their years of experience and accumulated wisdom Rookies in professional sports are often expected to sit on the bench and learn by watching experienced players New missionaries are assigned to work with a senior companion whose experience helps the new missionary learn the right way to effectively serve the Lord Of course there are times when we have no choice but to venture out on our own and do the best we can at figuring things out as we go along For example there are not a lot of people in my generation whose experience can help when it comes to the most modern of technologies When we have problems with modern technology we must look for someone who knows more about it than we do which usually means turning to one of you young people It is my message and testimony to you today my young friends that for the most important questions of your eternal lives there are answers in the scriptures and in the words and testimonies of apostles and prophets The fact that these words come largely from older men past and present doesn t make them any less relevant In fact it makes their words even more valuable to you because they come from those who have learned much through years of devout living There is a famous saying attributed to George Santayana You ve probably heard it Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it in John Bartlett comp Familiar Quotations 15th ed 1980 703 There are in fact several different variations of this quote including Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it Regardless of the exact language the sentiment is profound There are great lessons to be learned from the past and you ought to learn them so that you don t exhaust your spiritual strength repeating past mistakes and bad choices You don t have to be a Latter day Saint you don t even have to be religious to see the repeating pattern of history in the lives of God s children as recorded in the Old Testament Time and again we see the cycle of righteousness followed by wickedness Similarly the Book of Mormon records that ancient civilizations of this continent followed exactly the same pattern righteousness followed by prosperity followed by material comforts followed by greed followed by pride followed by wickedness and a collapse of morality until the people brought calamities upon themselves sufficient to stir them up to humility repentance and change In the relatively short span of years covered by the New Testament the historic pattern repeats itself again This time the people turned against Christ and His Apostles The collapse was so great we have come to know it as the Great Apostasy which led to the centuries of spiritual stagnation and ignorance called the Dark Ages Now I need to be very clear about these historically reoccurring periods of apostasy and spiritual darkness Our Heavenly Father loves all of His children and He wants them all to have the blessings of the gospel in their lives Spiritual light is not lost because God turns His back on His children Rather spiritual darkness results when His children turn their collective backs on Him It is a natural consequence of bad choices made by individuals communities countries and entire civilizations This has been proven again and again throughout the course of time One of the great lessons of this historical pattern is that our choices both individually and collectively do result in spiritual consequences for ourselves and for our posterity In every dispensation God s loving desire to bless His children is manifest in the miraculous restoration of the gospel truth to the earth through living prophets The Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early 1800s is only the most recent example Similar restorations were accomplished in earlier times through such prophets as Noah Abraham Moses and of course the Lord Jesus Christ Himself The 179 years that have passed since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints was officially organized have been extraordinary by any measure Never in recorded history has there been a period of such remarkable progress in terms of science and technology These advances have helped to facilitate gospel growth and expansion throughout the world But they have also contributed to the rise of materialism and self indulgence and to the decline of morality We live in an era when the boundaries of good taste and public decency are being pushed to the point where there are no boundaries at all The commandments of God have taken a beating in the vacillating marketplace of ideas that absolutely rejects the notion of right and wrong Certain factions of society seem generally mistrustful of anyone who chooses to live according to religious belief And when people of faith attempt to warn others of the possible consequences of their sinful choices they are scoffed at and ridiculed and their most sacred rites and cherished values are publicly mocked Does any of this sound familiar my young brothers and sisters Do you see the historical pattern emerging again the pattern of righteousness followed by prosperity followed by material comforts followed by greed followed by pride followed by wickedness and a collapse of morality the same pattern we ve seen again and again within the pages of the Old and New Testaments and the Book of Mormon More importantly what impact will the lessons of the past have on the personal choices you make right now and for the rest of your lives The voice of the Lord is clear and unmistakable He knows you He loves you He wants you to be eternally happy But according to your God given agency the choice is yours Each one of you has to decide for yourself if you are going to ignore the past and suffer the painful mistakes and tragic pitfalls that have befallen previous generations experiencing for yourself the devastating consequences of bad choices How much better your life will be if you will follow the noble example of the faithful followers of Christ such as the sons of Helaman Moroni Joseph Smith and the stalwart pioneers and choose as they did to remain faithful to your Heavenly Father s commandments With all my heart I hope and pray that you will be wise enough to learn the lessons of the past You don t have to spend time as a Laman or a Lemuel in order to know that it s much better to be a Nephi or a Jacob You don t have to follow the path of Cain or Gadianton in order to realize that wickedness never was happiness Alma 41 10 And you don t have to allow your community to become like Sodom or Gomorrah in order to understand that it isn t a good place to raise a family Learning the lessons of the past allows you to walk boldly in the light without running the risk of stumbling in the darkness This is the way it s supposed to work This is God s plan father and mother grandfather and grandmother teaching their children children learning from them and then becoming a more righteous generation through their own personal experiences and opportunities Learning the lessons of the past allows you to build personal testimony on a solid bedrock of obedience faith and the witness of the Spirit Of course it s not enough to learn these lessons as a matter of history and culture Learning the names and dates and sequence of events from the printed page won t help you very much unless the meaning and the message are written in your hearts Nourished by testimony and watered with faith the lessons of the past can take root in your hearts and become a vibrant part of who you are And so it returns as it always does to your own personal faith and testimony That is the difference maker my young brothers and sisters That is how you know That is how you avoid the mistakes of the past and take your spirituality to the next level If you are open and receptive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit in your lives you will understand the lessons of the past and they will be burned into your souls by the power of your testimonies And how do you get such a testimony Well there s no new technology for that nor will there ever be You cannot do a Google search to gain a testimony You can t text message faith You gain a vibrant life changing testimony today the same way it has always been done The process hasn t been changed It comes through desire study prayer obedience and service That is why the teachings of prophets and apostles past and present are as relevant to your life today as they ever have been That you may find joy and happiness and peace in the future by learning the great and eternal lessons of the past is my prayer for each of you for my grandchildren and all of the youth of the Church wherever you may be which I offer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters on July 19th of this year the Sons of Utah Pioneers placed at This Is the Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City a statue of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successor President Brigham Young This statue entitled Eyes Westward shows these two great prophets with a map of the western territories Many people including Latter day Saints forget that Joseph Smith was very much aware that the Church would eventually be relocated to the great American West In August of 1842 he prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains many would apostatize others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease and some would live to build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains History of the Church 5 85 Even Joseph s closest associates in those early years did not fully understand the trials that the Latter day Saints would endure as the Church rolled forth from its small beginnings in the early 1800s But Joseph Smith knew that no enemy then present or in the future would have sufficient power to frustrate or stop the purposes of God We are all familiar with his prophetic words The Standard of Truth has been erected no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing persecutions may rage mobs may combine armies may assemble calumny may defame but the truth of God will go forth boldly nobly and independent till it has penetrated every continent visited every clime swept every country and sounded in every ear till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done History of the Church 4 540 Nearly 18 decades have passed since the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in 1830 We have had 178 years to observe the fulfillment of prophecy and to watch the truth of God as it goes forth boldly nobly and independent The Church began its first decade with only a few members Despite intense opposition 597 missionaries were called during the 1830s and over 15 000 converts were baptized into the Church The United States Canada and Great Britain were opened to the preaching of the gospel There were many converts during the 1840s while persecutions continued to rage against the Church and especially against the Prophet Joseph In the midst of these difficulties and despite the great challenges of travel the restored gospel of Jesus Christ continued to cover more of the earth through the faithful service of 1 454 missionaries called during the 1840s and Church membership grew to more than 48 000 On June 27 1844 the persecution of Joseph Smith culminated when he and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob in the Carthage Jail Soon after the Martyrdom and in fulfillment of Joseph s vision Brigham Young and the Church began preparations to move to the Rocky Mountains Hardship affliction death and apostasy were ever present Still the work moved forward In the 1850s some 705 missionaries were called to serve in areas including Scandinavia France Italy Switzerland and Hawaii Missionary work also began in such diverse parts of the world as India Hong Kong Thailand Burma South Africa and the West Indies Among faithful converts from Scandinavia and Britain baptized during the decade of the 1850s were those who suffered and died on land and on the seas as they journeyed to join with the Saints here in the Rocky Mountains In 1875 the first seven missionaries were called to Mexico and the work there flourished even amidst revolution and other challenges And it was just four years ago in 2004 that the Church reached the milestone of one million members in Mexico The faith of the Saints was tested in every footstep as Brigham Young led them to build temples and establish more than 350 colonies in the West By the time Brigham Young died in 1877 worldwide Church membership had grown to more than 115 000 Despite all of the persecution the truth of God was indeed going forth boldly and nobly Time does not allow a detailed review of the growth of the Church during the next few decades But it should be noted that during the 40 year period from 1890 to 1930 while the Church and its doctrine were still under public attack Elder Reed Smoot was elected to the United States Congress and had to fight to be seated A great deal was said of the Church and its teachings during that time much of it hurtful and directed towards President Joseph F Smith and other Church leaders However some newspaper articles began to speak of members of the Church as contributing citizens and good people On September 3 1925 President Heber J Grant announced that the Church would begin missionary work in South America Following the Lord s pattern for taking the restored gospel to all nations a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles my paternal grandfather Elder Melvin J Ballard was sent with others to South America to dedicate the land for the preaching of the gospel On Christmas morning of 1925 in Argentina Elder Ballard dedicated the South American countries and started missionary work Before leaving the following July he prophesied The work of the Lord will grow slowly for a time here just as an oak grows slowly from an acorn It will not shoot up in a day as does the sunflower that grows quickly and then dies But thousands will join the Church here It will be divided into more than one mission and will be one of the strongest in the Church The work here is the smallest that it will ever be in Melvin R Ballard Melvin J Ballard Crusader for Righteousness 1966 84 Anyone familiar with the growth of the Church in South America knows the fulfillment of that prophecy Today Brazil alone has over one million members During the four decades from 1930 to 1970 more than 106 000 missionaries were called to serve worldwide Church membership increased fourfold to over 2 800 000 More than one million new members were added just during the 1960s By 1970 missionaries were serving in 43 nations and 9 territories During this 40 year period the South American nations of Chile Brazil Uruguay Paraguay Ecuador Colombia Peru and Venezuela were opened to missionary work In Central America servants of the Lord unlocked the nations of Panama Costa Rica Guatemala El Salvador Honduras and Nicaragua In Asia major new efforts began to bear fruit in Korea Taiwan Singapore and the Philippines None of this was easy Challenges obstacles and persecution accompanied every attempt to take the truth of God into every continent and country so that it could sound in every ear Still we moved forward in faith challenges were met and obstacles were overcome President Spencer W Kimball asked members of the Church to lengthen their stride in spreading the gospel and sharing gospel truth He asked every stake in the world to increase the number of missionaries and he led the Church into using media to help convey our message to hundreds of millions of people throughout the earth During his 12 years as President of the Church nearly 200 000 missionaries served full time missions Worldwide Church membership almost doubled and the number of stakes nearly tripled Missionary work was opened or reopened in many countries and the miracle of conversion was happening in many lands despite every adversarial attempt to thwart the Lord s work or discourage the Lord s workers A little more than two decades have passed since the end of President Kimball s mortal ministry During that period of time we have experienced unprecedented prominence in the worldwide community of faith Probably not coincidentally we have also experienced unprecedented ideological attacks on our people our history and our doctrine through the media And yet the Church continues to grow Membership has more than doubled again from 5 9 million in 1985 to more than 13 million today And last year the one millionth missionary to serve during this dispensation was called Now my brothers and sisters my purpose in this brief review of Joseph s prophetic vision of the destiny of this Church and its literal fulfillment through the decades is to remind us of this simple truth The works and the designs and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated neither can they come to naught For God doth not walk in crooked paths neither doth he vary from that which he hath said therefore his paths are straight and his course is one eternal round Remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated but the work of men D C 3 1 3 God has spoken through His prophet and announced to the world that the Standard of Truth has been erected and that no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing That is undeniably and indisputably true We have seen it for ourselves in decade after decade from the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith to the time of President Thomas S Monson Persecutions have raged Calumny and lies and misrepresentation have attempted to defame But in every decade from the time of the Restoration forward the truth of God has gone forth boldly nobly and independent The little Church that started in 1830 with just a handful of members has now grown to more than 13 million Latter day Saints in many different nations around the world and we are well on our way to penetrating every continent visiting every clime sweeping every country and sounding in every ear This is God s work and God s work will not be frustrated But there is still much to be done before the Great Jehovah can announce that the work is done While we praise and honor those faithful Saints who have brought us to this point of public prominence we cannot afford my brothers and sisters to be comfortable or content We are all needed to finish the work that was begun by those pioneering Saints over 175 years ago and carried out through the subsequent decades by faithful Saints of every generation We need to believe as they believed We need to work as they worked We need to serve as they served And we need to overcome as they overcame Of course our challenges are different today but they are no less demanding Instead of angry mobs we face those who constantly try to defame Instead of extreme exposure and hardship we face alcohol and drug abuse pornography all kinds of filth sleaze greed dishonesty and spiritual apathy Instead of families being uprooted and torn from their homes we see the institution of the family including the divine institution of marriage under attack as groups and individuals seek to define away the prominent and divine role of the family in society This is not to suggest that our challenges today are more severe than the challenges faced by those who have gone before us They are just different The Lord isn t asking us to load up a handcart He s asking us to fortify our faith He isn t asking us to walk across a continent He s asking us to walk across the street to visit our neighbor He isn t asking us to give all of our worldly possessions to build a temple He s asking us to give of our means and our time despite the pressures of modern living to continue to build temples and then to attend regularly the temples already built He isn t asking us to die a martyr s death He s asking us to live a disciple s life This is a great time to live brothers and sisters and it is up to us to carry on the rich tradition of devoted commitment that has been the hallmark of previous generations of Latter day Saints This is not a time for the spiritually faint of heart We cannot afford to be superficially righteous Our testimonies must run deep with spiritual roots firmly embedded in the rock of revelation And we must continue to move the work forward as a covenanted consecrated people with faith in every footstep till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done That it may be so for us is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters recently my wife Barbara had back surgery and could not lift twist or bend Consequently I have done more lifting twisting and bending than ever before and it has made me more appreciative of what women and especially you mothers do every day in our homes While women live in homes under many different circumstances married single widowed or divorced some with children and some without all are beloved of God and He has a plan for His righteous daughters to receive the highest blessings of eternity This afternoon I want to focus my remarks primarily on mothers particularly on young mothers As a young father I learned the demanding role of motherhood I served as a counselor and then as bishop for a period of 10 years During that time we were blessed with six of our seven children Barbara was often worn out by the time I got home Sunday evening She tried to explain what it was like to sit on the back row in sacrament meeting with our young family Then the day came that I was released After sitting on the stand for 10 years I was now sitting with my family on the back row The ward s singing mothers chorus was providing the music and I found myself sitting alone with our six children I have never been so busy in my whole life I had the hand puppets going on both hands and that wasn t working too well The Cheerios got away from me and that was embarrassing The coloring books didn t seem to entertain as well as they should As I struggled with the children through the meeting I looked up at Barbara and she was watching me and smiling I learned for myself to more fully appreciate what all of you dear mothers do so well and so faithfully A generation later as a grandfather I have watched the sacrifices my daughters have made in rearing their children And now still another generation later I am watching with awe the pressures on my granddaughters as they guide their children in this busy and demanding world After observing and empathizing with three generations of mothers and thinking of my own dear mother I surely know that there is no role in life more essential and more eternal than that of motherhood There is no one perfect way to be a good mother Each situation is unique Each mother has different challenges different skills and abilities and certainly different children The choice is different and unique for each mother and each family Many are able to be full time moms at least during the most formative years of their children s lives and many others would like to be Some may have to work part or full time some may work at home some may divide their lives into periods of home and family and work What matters is that a mother loves her children deeply and in keeping with the devotion she has for God and her husband prioritizes them above all else I am impressed by countless mothers who have learned how important it is to focus on the things that can only be done in a particular season of life If a child lives with parents for 18 or 19 years that span is only one fourth of a parent s life And the most formative time of all the early years in a child s life represents less than one tenth of a parent s normal life It is crucial to focus on our children for the short time we have them with us and to seek with the help of the Lord to teach them all we can before they leave our homes This eternally important work falls to mothers and fathers as equal partners I am grateful that today many fathers are more involved in the lives of their children But I believe that the instincts and the intense nurturing involvement of mothers with their children will always be a major key to their well being In the words of the proclamation on the family Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children The Family A Proclamation to the World Liahona Oct 2004 49 Ensign Nov 1995 102 We need to remember that the full commitment of motherhood and of putting children first can be difficult Through my own four generation experience in our family and through discussions with mothers of young children throughout the Church I know something of a mother s emotions that accompany her commitment to be at home with young children There are moments of great joy and incredible fulfillment but there are also moments of a sense of inadequacy monotony and frustration Mothers may feel they receive little or no appreciation for the choice they have made Sometimes even husbands seem to have no idea of the demands upon their wives As a Church we have enormous respect and gratitude to you mothers of young children We want you to be happy and successful in your families and to have the validation and support you need and deserve So today let me ask and briefly answer four questions While my answers may seem extremely simple if the simple things are being tended to a mother s life can be most rewarding The first question What can you do as a young mother to reduce the pressure and enjoy your family more First recognize that the joy of motherhood comes in moments There will be hard times and frustrating times But amid the challenges there are shining moments of joy and satisfaction Author Anna Quindlen reminds us not to rush past the fleeting moments She said The biggest mistake I made as a parent is the one that most of us make I did not live in the moment enough This is particularly clear now that the moment is gone captured only in photographs There is one picture of my three children sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day ages six four and one And I wish I could remember what we ate and what we talked about and how they sounded and how they looked when they slept that night I wish I had not been in such a hurry to get on to the next thing dinner bath book bed I wish I had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less Loud and Clear 2004 10 11 Second don t overschedule yourselves or your children We live in a world that is filled with options If we are not careful we will find every minute jammed with social events classes exercise time book clubs scrapbooking Church callings music sports the Internet and our favorite TV shows One mother told me of a time that her children had 29 scheduled commitments every week music lessons Scouts dance Little League day camps soccer art and so forth She felt like a taxi driver Finally she called a family meeting and announced Something has to go we have no time to ourselves and no time for each other Families need unstructured time when relationships can deepen and real parenting can take place Take time to listen to laugh and to play together Third even as you try to cut out the extra commitments sisters find some time for yourself to cultivate your gifts and interests Pick one or two things that you would like to learn or do that will enrich your life and make time for them Water cannot be drawn from an empty well and if you are not setting aside a little time for what replenishes you you will have less and less to give to others even to your children Avoid any kind of substance abuse mistakenly thinking that it will help you accomplish more And don t allow yourself to be caught up in the time wasting mind numbing things like television soap operas or surfing the Internet Turn to the Lord in faith and you will know what to do and how to do it Fourth pray study and teach the gospel Pray deeply about your children and about your role as a mother Parents can offer a unique and wonderful kind of prayer because they are praying to the Eternal Parent of us all There is great power in a prayer that essentially says We are steward parents over Thy children Father please help us to raise them as Thou wouldst want them raised The second question What more can a husband do to support his wife the mother of their children First show extra appreciation and give more validation for what your wife does every day Notice things and say thank you often Schedule some evenings together just the two of you Second have a regular time to talk with your wife about each child s needs and what you can do to help Third give your wife a day away now and then Just take over the household and give your wife a break from her daily responsibilities Taking over for a while will greatly enhance your appreciation of what your wife does You may do a lot of lifting twisting and bending Fourth come home from work and take an active role with your family Don t put work friends or sports ahead of listening to playing with and teaching your children The third question What can children even young children do Now you children please listen to me because there are some simple things you can do to help your mother You can pick up your toys when you are finished playing with them and when you get a little older you can make your bed help with the dishes and do other chores without being asked You can say thank you more often when you finish a nice meal when a story is read to you at bedtime or when clean clothes are put in your drawers Most of all you can put your arms around your mother often and tell her you love her The last question What can the Church do There are many things the Church offers to mothers and families but for my purpose today may I suggest that the bishopric and the ward council members be especially watchful and considerate of the time and resource demands on young mothers and their families Know them and be wise in what you ask them to do at this time in their lives Alma s counsel to his son Helaman applies to us today Behold I say unto you that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass Alma 37 6 I hope all of you dear sisters married or single never wonder if you have worth in the sight of the Lord and to the leaders of the Church We love you We respect you and appreciate your influence in preserving the family and assisting with the growth and the spiritual vitality of the Church Let us remember that the family is central to the Creator s plan for the eternal destiny of His children The Family A Proclamation to the World The scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles help all family members to prepare together now to be together through all eternity I pray that God will continually bless the women of the Church to find joy and happiness in their sacred roles as daughters of God Now in closing I want to add my witness of President Monson s prophetic call I have known him since he was 22 and I was 21 That s 58 years I have watched the hand of the Lord prepare him for this day to preside over the Church as the prophet and President And I add my testimony along with all of the other testimonies that have been borne through this conference of his special calling as President of the Church and add my testimony along with all of the others that Jesus is the Christ and this is His Church We are doing His work to which I testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters since the sesquicentennial anniversary in 1997 there has been a dramatic increase worldwide in inquiries about the Church This growing interest is fueled by our rapid growth by events like the Winter Olympics here in Salt Lake City and by the prominence in their chosen professions of many of our individual members I am sure that these questions come not only to the Church but to you as individual members It is not easy to explain something as vast as the Church or as wonderful as the restored gospel to people who know little or nothing about us Even questions on one specific aspect can be difficult to answer because every question seems to be connected to other questions The most common request we hear is a fairly simple one that goes something like this Tell me a little about your Church The key word here is little They are not saying Tell me everything you know and then send others to tell me everything else We of course welcome people s interest and many will want to be taught more about our doctrines and beliefs This is why we have over 53 000 full time missionaries serving at their own expense throughout the world But we need to remember that there is a difference between interest and mere curiosity Sometimes people just want to know what the Church is Those who are curious in this general way deserve clear and accurate information that comes directly from those of us who are members so that they do not have to rely on the incomplete answers half truths or false statements that may come from the media or other outside voices The many misunderstandings and false information about the Church are somewhat our own fault for not clearly explaining who we are and what we believe The Public Affairs Committee on which I serve has learned that there is a great need for clear simple statements that present those who are curious with the basics about the Church as it is today Let me share with you some of the things we have found to be helpful You may want to prepare your own list of talking points that will assist you in explaining what we believe to your friends and acquaintances of other faiths It may be helpful for you as it is for me to have on one page a few facts about the Church as it is today to give to them along with a copy of the Articles of Faith Here are four subjects that will help someone today to gain a basic understanding of the Church Under each of the four headings there are some simple statements I have found helpful Try to imagine them being heard or read by a person who knows virtually nothing about us The four main subjects deal with facts faith families and fruits of the restored gospel FactsSome facts might include First Mormon is a nickname for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Members are often referred to as Mormons Latter day Saints or LDS The term Saint means member Second the Church was restored in 1830 in upstate New York with Joseph Smith as its first prophet and president Today it is headquartered in Salt Lake City with President Gordon B Hinckley as the present prophet Third there are now over 13 million members in 176 countries and territories About 6 million of these are in the United States making us the fourth largest Christian denomination in America As one of the fastest growing Christian faiths in the world we complete a new chapel every working day Members pay a tithe which is 10 percent of their income making this and other programs possible Fourth local congregations are led by volunteer unpaid members Both men and women serve in assigned leadership positions And fifth Mormons are well represented in politics and government In the United States for example there are 16 members in Congress from both political parties Members also serve in high and trusted positions throughout the world in business medicine law education media sports and entertainment FaithNext people need to know something of our faith as committed Christians with strong traditional values Along with the Articles of Faith we need to emphasize that We believe in the eternity of the soul that God is the Father of our spirits and that we can return to Him after death We believe that Jesus Christ is our personal Savior and we try to model our lives after Him and His teachings We commemorate Christ s atoning sacrifice in our Sunday worship services similar to taking communion in other churches We accept as fellow Christians all who believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God and the Savior of all mankind Many Christians do not understand that we have much common ground with them Joseph Smith taught that Jesus Christ is the core of our belief and everything else is an appendage to it see Elders Journal July 1838 44 The name of the Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints We believe the original church that Jesus established was lost and has been restored again in our day The priesthood the authority given to man to act in the name of God with apostles and a prophet to lead us has been restored as have all necessary ordinances of salvation We believe in and we use the Holy Bible both the Old and New Testaments And we believe in the Book of Mormon and other books of scripture which support and authenticate the Bible and testify of the ministry and divinity of Christ and of God s ongoing revelation to man Indeed the Book of Mormon is Another Testament of Jesus Christ FamilyThe next thing it is good for people to know is how family centered our theology and our lifestyles are Once again simple statements are helpful to someone who is uninformed but curious about the importance we place on families Mormons place particularly strong emphasis on family as the basic unit of the Church and of society We have a deep commitment to marriage defined as a union between one man and one woman Polygamy a limited practice in the early pioneer days of the Church was discontinued in 1890 some 117 years ago Families and individuals whether members of our faith or not can attend Sunday services in our chapels Here we worship together instructing one another from the scriptures Latter day Saint families are encouraged to hold family home evenings weekly usually on Monday nights This provides a regular and predictable time for parents to teach values to their children and to have fun together We invite those not of our faith to adopt this practice with their own families The Church has auxiliary programs for women youth and children as a support to the family These programs provide such things as religious instruction opportunities for Christian service sports drama music and Scouting And there is also much focus on extended family genealogy and personal family history providing young and old with a stronger sense of roots identity and belonging The highest and most sacred ordinances of our faith relate to our families both living and dead and some of these ordinances take place in our temples FruitsNow even as someone begins to understand a few facts about us and comes to know us more accurately by our faith and the importance of family it was the Savior who said by their fruits ye shall know them Matthew 7 20 emphasis added A church or any way of life should be judged by the fruits or the results that it generates Here are a few examples based on United States statistics But these would be similar throughout the world among practicing Mormons by which we mean those who attend church and the temple regularly One of the fruits is a longer life Studies show that practicing Mormons are healthier and therefore live longer than the national average In 1833 the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith the Word of Wisdom which is the way to live in order to enjoy a long and healthy life Second those who are married in and attend the temple regularly have a divorce rate far below the national and world average Third we achieve an educational level that is higher than the national average Fourth over 70 000 members volunteer at their own expense to serve for 18 to 24 months in humanitarian efforts Church service assignments and full time missionary service throughout the world And fifth we place strong emphasis on self reliance and a solid work ethic We encourage active involvement in our communities and in providing service to others The Church continues to donate substantial money goods and services to humanitarian causes around the globe including untold hours of labor donated by members to assist in disaster cleanup and relief Brothers and sisters in today s busy world I have found that most people will not read or focus on more than just a few important facts at one time Whatever you choose to use to inform your friends and acquaintances about the Church write it down check it for accuracy and keep it simple and short The growing prominence of the Church and the increasing inquiries from others present us with great opportunities to build bridges make friends and pass on accurate information But it can also present a greater possibility of misunderstanding and sometimes even prejudice if we allow others to define who we are and what we believe rather than presenting it ourselves Generally there is no problem with those who are personally acquainted with our members But there are millions upon millions who are not acquainted with any members of our faith I would hope that those who know very little about the Church would seek to learn more about us I would hope they would get to know our members rather than judging us by the misinformation given by those who do not know and in some cases by those who would deliberately mislead or defame You as members can help this to happen by reaching out and sharing with others the basic information found in the Articles of Faith along with such things as the facts faith families and fruits of the gospel We should also remember that sometimes the best way to answer people s interest can be by how we live how we radiate the joy of the gospel in our lives how we treat others and how sincerely we follow the teachings of Christ For those who want to learn more than just the few basics I have discussed the missionaries can be called upon to teach them the doctrine from chapter 3 in Preach My Gospel The missionaries know how to answer more of their questions and lead them to conversion and baptism Now is the time for all of us to reach out and tell others who we are Prepare some simple facts such as those I have shared with you today and help those who are curious to know a little about the Church and then to want to know more about the Restoration of the gospel Brothers and sisters never hesitate to bear your testimony with sincerity and love The power of personal testimony cannot be denied and often ignites in others the interest to know more I know this to be true and leave you my absolute witness that I know The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is true and I bear that testimony to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters the Holy Bible is a miracle It is a miracle that the Bible s 4 000 years of sacred and secular history were recorded and preserved by the prophets apostles and inspired churchmen It is a miracle that we have the Bible s powerful doctrine principles poetry and stories But most of all it is a wonderful miracle that we have the account of the life ministry and words of Jesus which was protected through the Dark Ages and through the conflicts of countless generations so that we may have it today It is a miracle that the Bible literally contains within its pages the converting healing Spirit of Christ which has turned men s hearts for centuries leading them to pray to choose right paths and to search to find their Savior The Holy Bible is well named It is holy because it teaches truth holy because it warms us with its spirit holy because it teaches us to know God and understand His dealings with men and holy because it testifies throughout its pages of the Lord Jesus Christ Abraham Lincoln said of the Bible This Great Book is the best gift God has given to man All the good the Saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book But for it we could not know right from wrong Speeches and Writings 1859 1865 1989 628 It is not by chance or coincidence that we have the Bible today Righteous individuals were prompted by the Spirit to record both the sacred things they saw and the inspired words they heard and spoke Other devoted people were prompted to protect and preserve these records Men like John Wycliffe the courageous William Tyndale and Johannes Gutenberg were prompted against much opposition to translate the Bible into language people could understand and to publish it in books people could read I believe even the scholars of King James had spiritual promptings in their translation work The Dark Ages were dark because the light of the gospel was hidden from the people They did not have the apostles or prophets nor did they have access to the Bible The clergy kept the scriptures secret and unavailable to the people We owe much to the many brave martyrs and reformers like Martin Luther John Calvin and John Huss who demanded freedom to worship and common access to the holy books William Tyndale gave his life because he believed so deeply in the power of the Bible He said The nature of God s word is that whosoever read it or hear it reasoned and disputed before him it will begin immediately to make him every day better and better till he be grown into a perfect man in S Michael Wilcox Fire in the Bones William Tyndale Martyr Father of the English Bible 2004 xv Honest diligent study of the Bible does make us better and better and we must ever remember the countless martyrs who knew of its power and who gave their lives that we may be able to find within its words the path to the eternal happiness and the peace of our Heavenly Father s kingdom Although these early Christian reformers agreed on many things they ultimately disagreed on many points of doctrine This resulted in the organization of numerous Christian denominations Roger Williams an early champion of religious liberty concluded that there was no regularly constituted Church on earth nor any person authorized to administer any Church ordinance nor could there be until new apostles were sent by the great Head of the Church for whose coming he was seeking see William Cullen Bryant ed Picturesque America or the Land We Live In 2 vols 1872 74 1 502 Tens of millions of individuals have come to a faith in God and in Jesus Christ through seeking truth in the Holy Bible Countless numbers of them had nothing but the Bible to feed and guide their faith Because of the efforts of the reformers the Bible became a household possession The word of God was read around the family fireside of the lowly as well as the parlors of the great John A Widtsoe in Conference Report Apr 1939 20 Millions of families have come together seeking to find the Church of Jesus Christ through their study of the Bible One of those families in the early 1800s in upstate New York was the family of Joseph Smith Sr One of his sons was Joseph Smith Jr who searched the Bible seeking to know which of the many denominations was the same as the Church that Jesus Christ organized He was prompted by the words of the Bible to pray for further spiritual light and knowledge from God Determined to seek the wisdom promised in the holy scriptures Joseph knelt in humble prayer early in the spring of 1820 Oh what marvelous light and truth were shed upon him that day as he beheld the glorious manifestation of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Once again God called a prophet as He did in the days of Noah Abraham and Moses How grateful we should be for the Holy Bible In it we learn not only of the life and teachings and doctrines of Christ we learn of His Church and of His priesthood and of the organization which He established and named the Church of Jesus Christ in those former days We believe in that Church and we believe that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is that same Church restored to earth complete with the same organization and the same priesthood Without the Bible we would not know of His Church then nor would we have the fulness of His gospel now I love the Bible its teachings its lessons and its spirit I love the Old Testament s compelling profound stories and its great prophets testifying of the coming of Christ I love the New Testament s apostolic travels and miracles and the letters of Paul Most of all I love its eyewitness accounts of the words and the example and the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ I love the perspective and peace that come from reading the Bible Brothers and sisters I am sure many of you have had the experience of hearing people say that Mormons are not Christians because they have their own Bible the Book of Mormon To anyone harboring this misconception we say that we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior and the author of our salvation and that we believe revere and love the Holy Bible We do have additional sacred scripture including the Book of Mormon but it supports the Bible never substituting for it Jesus taught that we should search the scriptures for they are they which testify of me John 5 39 These words provide insight and inspiration to all who sincerely seek to know and understand the truth about Jesus Christ The scriptures are rich in history doctrine stories sermons and testimonies all of which ultimately focus on the eternal Christ and His physical and spiritual mission to Heavenly Father s children Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints believe that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable 2 Timothy 3 16 We love the Bible and other scriptures That may be surprising to some who may not be aware of our belief in the Bible as the revealed word of God It is one of the pillars of our faith a powerful witness of the Savior and of Christ s ongoing influence in the lives of those who worship and follow Him The more we read and study the Bible and its teachings the more clearly we see the doctrinal underpinnings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ We tend to love the scriptures that we spend time with We may need to balance our study in order to love and understand all scripture You young people especially do not discount or devalue the Holy Bible It is the sacred holy record of the Lord s life The Bible contains hundreds of pages more than all of our other scripture combined It is the bedrock of all Christianity We do not criticize or belittle anyone s beliefs Our great responsibility as Christians is to share all that God has revealed with all of His sons and daughters Those who join this Church do not give up their faith in the Bible they strengthen it The Book of Mormon does not dilute nor diminish nor de emphasize the Bible On the contrary it expands extends and exalts it The Book of Mormon testifies of the Bible and both testify of Christ The first testament of Christ is the Bible s Old Testament which predicted and prophesied of the coming of the Savior His transcendent life and His liberating Atonement The second Bible testament of Christ is the New Testament which records His birth His life His ministry His gospel His Church His Atonement and His Resurrection as well as the testimonies of His Apostles The third testament of Christ is the Book of Mormon which also foretells Christ s coming confirms the Bible s account of His saving Atonement and then reveals the resurrected Lord s visit to the earth s other hemisphere The subtitle of the Book of Mormon the clarifying purpose statement printed on the cover of every copy is Another Testament of Jesus Christ Each of these three testaments is a part of the great indivisible whole of the Lord s revealed word to His children They contain the words of Christ which we have been admonished to feast upon as a means of qualifying for eternal life see 2 Nephi 31 20 Those who think that one part is more important or more true than the other parts are missing some of the beauty and completeness of the canon of ancient scripture And those who think that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints do not believe in Jesus Christ or in the Bible should take time to understand the Church the significance of its name and the power of its message I am puzzled by any who would question this Church s belief in the Bible and our position as Christians The name of the Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints In our last general conference here in this building our Church leaders quoted from the Bible nearly 200 times This Church is organized and functions like the Church that Christ and His Apostles established in the New Testament Seated on the stand today are the prophet and the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ I bear solemn witness that we are true and full believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His revealed word through the Holy Bible We not only believe the Bible we strive to follow its precepts and to teach its message The message of our missionaries is Christ and His gospel and His Atonement and the scriptures are the text of that message We say to all people We extend our love to you and invite you to come Let us share all that God has revealed My brothers and sisters we must help all people including our own members understand the power and importance of the Holy Bible The Bible is scripture that leads us and all mankind to accept Jesus Christ as our Savior May God grant us the desire and capacity to accept and live His teachings is my humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters while I was studying the Book of Mormon recently one of the teachings of the prophet Jacob caught my attention As you remember Jacob was one of Father Lehi s two sons born in the wilderness after the family left Jerusalem He was an eyewitness to miracles and he also watched as his family was torn apart by disobedience and rebellion Jacob knew and loved Laman and Lemuel as he knew and loved Nephi and the dissension between them was intimate and personal As far as Jacob was concerned it wasn t about ideology philosophy or even theology It was about family The tender anguish of Jacob s soul is evident as he expresses grave concern that his people will reject the words of the prophets concerning Christ and deny the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost and make a mock of the great plan of redemption Jacob 6 8 And then just before he bids farewell he speaks eight simple words that are the basic text of my message this morning Jacob s plea was O be wise what can I say more Jacob 6 12 Those of you who are parents and grandparents have a sense of what Jacob must have been feeling at the time He loved his people partly because they were also his family He had taught them as clearly as he could and with all the energy of his soul He warned them in no uncertain terms what would happen if they chose not to enter in at the strait gate and continue in the way which is narrow Jacob 6 11 He couldn t think of anything else to say to warn to urge to inspire to motivate And so he simply and profoundly said O be wise what can I say more I have met with members of the Church in many nations of the world I m impressed with the spirit and energy of so many of our members Hearts are being touched and lives are being blessed The work is moving forward in dynamic ways and for that I am profoundly grateful But I see many ways that Church members must be so very wise in all that we do The Lord in His infinite wisdom has designed His Church to operate with a lay ministry That means we have been charged to watch over one another and to serve one another We are to love one another as our Father in Heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ love us Our callings and circumstances change from time to time providing us with different and unique opportunities to serve and to grow Most of the leaders and teachers in the Church are anxiously engaged in fulfilling their responsibilities Some are less effective than others it is true but almost always there is sincere effort to provide meaningful gospel service Occasionally we find some who become so energetic in their Church service that their lives become unbalanced They start believing that the programs they administer are more important than the people they serve They complicate their service with needless frills and embellishments that occupy too much time cost too much money and sap too much energy They refuse to delegate or to allow others to grow in their respective responsibilities As a result of their focusing too much time and energy on their Church service eternal family relationships can deteriorate Employment performance can suffer This is not healthy spiritually or otherwise While there may be times when our Church callings require more intense effort and unusual focus we need to strive to keep things in proper balance We should never allow our service to replace the attention needed by other important priorities in our lives Remember King Benjamin s counsel And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength Mosiah 4 27 May I suggest six ways in which we can serve both wisely and well First focus on people and principles not on programs One of the most important things we do through the gospel of Jesus Christ is to build people Properly serving others requires effort to understand them as individuals their personalities their strengths their concerns their hopes and dreams so that the correct help and support can be provided Frankly it s much easier to just manage programs than it is to understand and truly serve people The primary purpose of Church leadership meetings should be to discuss how to minister to people Most routine information and coordination can now be handled through phone calls e mails or regular mail so that agendas for council meetings and presidency meetings can focus on needs of the people Our goal should always be to use the programs of the Church as a means to lift encourage assist teach love and perfect people Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God D C 18 10 Programs are tools Their management and staffing must not take priority over the needs of the people they are designed to bless and to serve Second be innovative As we work to magnify our callings we should seek the inspiration of the Spirit to solve problems in ways that will best help the people we serve We have handbooks of instruction and their guidelines should be followed But within that framework are substantial opportunities to think to be creative and to make use of individual talents The instruction to magnify our callings is not a command to embellish and complicate them To innovate does not necessarily mean to expand very often it means to simplify Because the eternal principle of agency gives us the freedom to choose and think for ourselves we should become increasingly able to solve problems We may make the occasional mistake but as long as we are following gospel principles and guidelines we can learn from those mistakes and become more understanding of others and more effective in serving them Being innovative also means that we do not have to be told everything we should do The Lord said It is not meet that I should command in all things for he that is compelled in all things the same is a slothful and not a wise servant D C 58 26 We trust you brothers and sisters to use inspiration We trust that you will do so within the framework of Church policies and principles We trust that you will be wise in counseling together to help build faith and testimony in the lives of those whom you serve Third divide the work and delegate responsibility There is a difference between being responsible for getting the work done and doing the work yourself For example gone should be the days when the elders quorum president feels he needs to personally finish the home teaching visits that others have missed The same is true for Relief Society presidents with respect to visiting teaching Not only is this unwise it isn t home or visiting teaching Home teaching isn t about numbers or reporting visits to a home visits and numbers are just a measuring stick Home teaching is about love of people and service to and watchcare over our Heavenly Father s children Assignments should be made responsibilities should be delegated and members should be allowed to fulfill their stewardship as best they can Counsel advise persuade motivate but don t do the work for them Allow others to progress and grow even if it means sometimes getting less than perfect results on the reports Fourth eliminate guilt I hope it goes without saying that guilt is not a proper motivational technique for leaders and teachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ We must always motivate through love and sincere appreciation not by creating guilt I like the thought Catch others doing something right Still there are those who experience some feelings of guilt as a consequence of their service in the Church These feelings can come when our time and attention are being torn between competing demands and priorities As mortals we simply cannot do everything at once Therefore we must do all things in wisdom and order Mosiah 4 27 Often that will mean temporarily postponing attention to one priority in order to take care of another Sometimes family demands will require your full attention Other times professional responsibilities will come first And there will be times when Church callings will come first Good balance comes in doing things in a timely way and in not procrastinating our preparation or waiting to fulfill our responsibilities until the last minute Beyond that we need to remember that Christ came to remove guilt by forgiving those who repent see Alma 24 10 He came to bring peace to the troubled soul Peace I leave with you He said My peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid John 14 27 Through the miraculous Atonement He urges us to take my yoke upon you and ye shall find rest unto your souls Matthew 11 29 As the power of the Atonement begins to work in our lives we come to understand that the Savior has already born the burden of our guilt O that we may be wise enough to understand to repent as necessary and to let go of our guilt Fifth we need to thoughtfully allocate our resources of time income and energy I would like to let you in on a little secret Some of you have already learned it If you haven t it s time you knew No matter what your family needs are or your responsibilities in the Church there is no such thing as done There will always be more we can do There is always another family matter that needs attention another lesson to prepare another interview to conduct another meeting to attend We just need to be wise in protecting our health and in following the counsel that President Hinckley has given often to just do the best that we can The key it seems to me is to know and understand your own capabilities and limitations and then to pace yourself allocating and prioritizing your time your attention and your resources to wisely help others including your family in their quest for eternal life Sixth a word to you leaders about extending responsibilities to members and especially to recent converts President Hinckley said that every new member of the Church needs a responsibility Whatever responsibility may be extended should not overwhelm new members but should give them ample opportunity to become comfortable in the Church by learning its doctrine and by rubbing shoulders with friendly members It should anchor them to the restored gospel through increasing their testimony and giving meaningful service Brothers and sisters may we focus on the simple ways we can serve in the kingdom of God always striving to change lives including our own What is most important in our Church responsibilities is not the statistics that are reported or the meetings that are held but whether or not individual people ministered to one at a time just as the Savior did have been lifted and encouraged and ultimately changed Our task is to help others find the peace and the joy that only the gospel can give them In seven words Jesus summarized how we can accomplish this He said If ye love me keep my commandments John 14 15 Today is in many ways like Jacob s day My counsel is like unto his Repent and come with full purpose of heart and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you Jacob 6 5 Brothers and sisters be wise with your families Be wise in fulfilling your Church callings Be wise with your time Be wise in balancing all of your responsibilities O be wise my beloved brothers and sisters What can I say more May God bless us with wisdom to love His Son Jesus Christ and wisely help accomplish His work I bear my witness and testimony that He lives This is His Church We are about His work May the peace of the Lord be with us And may we wisely carry on our responsibilities I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters not many weeks ago I had both of my knees surgically replaced So when I say that I am grateful to be able to stand before you today it is no idle statement During this recuperative period I have been reminded of how blessed we are to know of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ I am overwhelmed when I think about the pain and the suffering He went through for us in Gethsemane and on the cross How He endured it I cannot comprehend But I thank Him and I love Him more profoundly than words can express I also thank President Hinckley for the privilege of being with him at the birthplace of the Prophet Joseph Because of Joseph Smith we have been given much Were it not for the Restoration we would not know the true nature of God our Heavenly Father or our own divine nature as His children We would not understand the eternal nature of our existence or know that the family can be together forever We would not be aware that God continues to speak to His prophets in our day beginning with the marvelous First Vision wherein the Father and the Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph We would not have the comforting assurance that we are led by a prophet President Gordon B Hinckley Without the Restoration we would likely be under the assumption that the entirety of God s word is found in the Bible As precious and wonderful as that book of scripture is we would not know of the Book of Mormon and other latter day scriptures that teach eternal truths which help us draw nearer to our Heavenly Father and the Savior Without the Restoration we would not have the blessings of priesthood ordinances that are valid in time and eternity We would not know the conditions of repentance nor would we understand the reality of the resurrection We would not have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost When we truly understand how great a blessing the gospel of Jesus Christ is in our lives when we accept and embrace these eternal truths and allow them to sink deep into our hearts and souls we experience a mighty change Alma 5 14 in our hearts We are filled with love and gratitude As the prophet Alma wrote we feel to sing the song of redeeming love Alma 5 26 to all who will hear it O that I were an angel Alma said and could have the wish of mine heart that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God with a voice to shake the earth and cry repentance unto every people Yea I would declare unto every soul the plan of redemption that they should repent and come unto our God that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth Alma 29 1 2 So it should be with us my brothers and sisters Our love for the Lord and appreciation for the Restoration of the gospel are all the motivation we need to share what gives us much joy and happiness It is the most natural thing in the world for us to do and yet far too many of us are hesitant to share our testimonies with others All around the world missionaries are responding to this testimony driven joy in sharing the gospel Many of them are entering the MTC with their own marked and well studied copies of the missionary guide Preach My Gospel I am pleased to report that with the use of Preach My Gospel they are increasingly able to teach in their own words by the power of the Spirit and are better able to adjust their lessons to the needs of those whom they are teaching As a result they are having meaningful impact on many lives But quite frankly what they need now is more people to teach Experience has shown that the best teaching situations develop when our members participate in the finding and teaching process This is nothing new you ve heard it before Some of you may even feel guilty that you are not giving much help to the missionaries Today I invite you to relax and set aside your concerns and focus instead on your love for the Lord your testimony of His eternal reality and your gratitude for all He has done for you If you are truly motivated by love and testimony and gratitude you will quite naturally do all that you can to assist the Lord in bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life Moses 1 39 of our Father s children In fact it would be impossible to keep you from doing it The Savior Himself showed us the way when He invited His disciples to come and see where he dwelt and they abode with him that day John 1 39 Why do you suppose He did that The scriptural record does not explain His reasoning but I am confident that it had nothing to do with comfort or convenience As always He was teaching And what better way to teach His followers than to invite them to visit with Him so they could see and experience His magnificent message firsthand Similarly our homes can be gospel sharing homes as people we know and love come into our homes and experience the gospel firsthand in both word and action We can share the gospel without holding a formal discussion Our families can be our lesson and the spirit that emanates from our homes can be our message Having a gospel sharing home will not only be a blessing for those we bring into our homes but for those who live within it By living in a gospel sharing home our testimonies become stronger and our understanding of the gospel improves The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that we can be forgiven of our sins when we help someone else repent see D C 62 3 We find joy in helping others come unto Christ and feel the redemptive power of His love see D C 18 14 16 Our families are blessed as the testimonies and faith of both parents and children increase In gospel sharing homes we pray for guidance for ourselves and we pray for the physical and spiritual well being of others We pray for the people the missionaries are teaching for our acquaintances and for those not of our faith In the gospel sharing homes of Alma s time the people would join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God Alma 6 6 Creating a gospel sharing home is the easiest and most effective way that we can share the gospel with others And we re not just talking about traditional homes with families consisting of two parents living with their children College students can create a gospel sharing home when they adorn the walls of their apartments with pictures that reflect spiritual pursuits instead of the things of the world Older couples and single members exemplify a gospel sharing home when they welcome new neighbors and invite them to attend church and visit them in their homes A gospel sharing home is one in which neighborhood children love to play making it natural to invite them and their family to attend church a family home evening or some other activity Teenagers visiting a gospel sharing home feel comfortable asking questions or participating with the family in prayer Gospel sharing homes are very ordinary They may not always be spotlessly clean nor the children perfectly behaved But they are a place in which family members clearly love each other and the Spirit of the Lord is felt by those who visit As we talk about what a gospel sharing home is perhaps it would also be helpful to identify some things that a gospel sharing home is not A gospel sharing home is not a program It is a way of life Creating a gospel sharing home means inviting our friends and neighbors into the ongoing flow of family and Church activities As we invite our friends to join us for these activities they will also feel the Spirit Creating a gospel sharing home does not mean that we are going to have to dedicate large amounts of time to meeting and cultivating friends with whom to share the gospel These friends will come naturally into our lives and if we are open about our membership in the Church from the very beginning we can easily bring gospel discussions into the relationship with very little risk of being misunderstood Friends and acquaintances will accept that this is part of who we are and they will feel free to ask questions A gospel sharing home is not defined by whether or not people join the Church as a result of our contact with them Our opportunity and responsibility are to care to share to testify to invite and then to allow individuals to decide for themselves We are blessed when we have invited them to consider the Restoration regardless of the outcome At the very least we have a rewarding relationship with someone from another faith and we can continue to enjoy their friendship In a gospel sharing home we do not just pray for the health safety and success of our missionaries throughout the world We also pray for our own missionary experiences and opportunities and to be prepared to act on those impressions as they come our way And I promise you they will come More than 20 years ago I suggested that the key to successful member missionary work is the exercise of faith One way to show your faith in the Lord and His promises is to prayerfully set a date to have someone prepared to meet with the missionaries I have received hundreds of letters from members who have exercised their faith in this simple way Even though families had no one in mind with whom they could share the gospel they set a date prayed and then talked to many more people The Lord is the Good Shepherd and He knows His sheep who have been prepared to hear His voice He will guide us as we seek His divine help in sharing His gospel A sister in France was asked about the secret of her success She said I simply share my joy I treat everyone as if they were already a member of the Church If I m standing by someone in line and strike up a conversation I share with them how much I enjoyed my Church meetings on Sunday When co workers ask What did you do this weekend I do not skip from Saturday night to Monday morning I share with them that I went to church what was said and my experiences with the Saints I talk about how I live think and feel In a gospel sharing home our personal missionary effort is a topic of family councils and discussions One faithful family counseled together on the need for each family member to be an example Later the son s high school coach who was not a member sent a donation to the Church Why Because this young man had impressed him with his courage in speaking up and telling his teammates to clean up their language There are thousands of experiences that could be shared where people have joined the Church because of the spirit and attitude they observe in the lives of those who come from gospel sharing homes Church literature or DVDs can introduce new friends to the Church Invitations to hear a family member speak in sacrament meeting or to attend the baptismal service of a family member or to tour a meetinghouse have also been appreciated by those who are not members From every indicator we have there is nothing more effective that any of us can do for our friends than to say come and see by joining with us in sacrament meeting Far too many do not know they are welcome to worship with us Of course all of us support the ward leaders and assist in making the ward mission plan effective Whatever our Church calling may be we help priesthood and auxiliary leaders assist missionaries welcome and involve visitors and fellowship new members You can ask the missionaries to show you their daily planners so you can see how you can best help them accomplish their goals As we work together the spirit of our gospel sharing homes will overflow in our chapels our classrooms and our cultural halls I bear testimony that if we will just do some of these simple things the Lord will lead us to find tens of thousands of Heavenly Father s children who are ready to be taught the gospel Our love for the Lord our appreciation for His atoning sacrifice and His mission to have all come unto Him should provide all the motivation we need to be successful in sharing the gospel May the Lord bless you my brothers and sisters with greater faith and trust in Him as you reach out now to introduce the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the people of the world I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Several of the Brethren and I recently visited a few of the refugee centers in Louisiana Mississippi and Texas where devastated and displaced victims of Hurricane Katrina were staying as they began to try to put their lives back together Their stories and situations are tragic and poignant in many ways but in all that I heard what touched me the most was the crying out for family Where is my mother I can t find my son I ve lost a sister These were hungry frightened people who had lost everything and needed food medical attention and help of all kinds but what they wanted and needed most was their families Crisis or transition of any kind reminds us of what matters most In the routine of life we often take our families our parents and children and siblings for granted But in times of danger and need and change there is no question that what we care about most is our families It will be even more so when we leave this life and enter into the spirit world Surely the first people we will seek to find there will be father mother spouse children and siblings I believe the mission statement for mortality might be to build an eternal family Here on this earth we strive to become part of extended families with the ability to create and form our own part of those families That is one of the reasons our Heavenly Father sent us here Not everyone will find a companion and have a family in mortality but everyone regardless of individual circumstances is a precious member of God s family Brothers and sisters this year marks the 10th anniversary of the proclamation to the world on the family which was issued by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1995 see The Family A Proclamation to the World Liahona Oct 2004 49 Ensign Nov 1995 102 It was then and is now a clarion call to protect and strengthen families and a stern warning in a world where declining values and misplaced priorities threaten to destroy society by undermining its basic unit The proclamation is a prophetic document not only because it was issued by prophets but because it was ahead of its time It warns against many of the very things that have threatened and undermined families during the last decade and calls for the priority and the emphasis families need if they are to survive in an environment that seems ever more toxic to traditional marriage and to parent child relationships The proclamation s clear and simple language stands in stark contrast to the confused and convoluted notions of a society that cannot even agree on a definition of family let alone supply the help and support parents and families need You are familiar with such words from the proclamation as these Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity The disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets And the last words of the proclamation express the simple truth that the family is the fundamental unit of society Today I call upon members of the Church and on committed parents grandparents and extended family members everywhere to hold fast to this great proclamation to make it a banner not unlike General Moroni s title of liberty and to commit ourselves to live by its precepts As we are all part of a family the proclamation applies to everyone Public opinion surveys indicate that people everywhere in the world generally consider the family as the highest priority yet in recent years the broader culture seems to ignore or misdefine the family Consider some of the changes of the past decade Many larger national and international institutions that used to support and strengthen families now try to supplant and even sabotage the very families they were created to serve In the name of tolerance the definition of family has been expanded beyond recognition to the point that family can be any individuals of any gender who live together with or without commitment or children or attention to consequence Rampant materialism and selfishness delude many into thinking that families and especially children are a burden and a financial millstone that will hold them back rather than a sacred privilege that will teach them to become more like God And yet most parents throughout the world continue to know both the importance and the joy that are attached to natural families Friends of mine who just returned from speaking to families and parents on several continents reported to me that the hopes and concerns of parents are remarkably similar throughout the earth In India a concerned Hindu mother said All I want is to be a bigger influence on my children than the media and the peer group And a Buddhist mother in Malaysia said I d like my boys to be able to operate in the world but I don t want them to be of the world Parents from all different cultures and faiths are saying and feeling the same things we are as parents in the Church The world needs to know what the proclamation teaches because the family is the basic unit of society of the economy of our culture and of our government And as Latter day Saints know the family will also be the basic unit in the celestial kingdom In the Church our belief in the overriding importance of families is rooted in restored doctrine We know of the sanctity of families in both directions of our eternal existence We know that before this life we lived with our Heavenly Father as part of His family and we know that family relationships can endure beyond death If we live and act upon this knowledge we will attract the world to us Parents who place a high priority on their families will gravitate to the Church because it offers the family structure values doctrine and eternal perspective that they seek and cannot find elsewhere Our family centered perspective should make Latter day Saints strive to be the best parents in the world It should give us enormous respect for our children who truly are our spiritual siblings and it should cause us to devote whatever time is necessary to strengthen our families Indeed nothing is more critically connected to happiness both our own and that of our children than how well we love and support one another within the family President Harold B Lee spoke of the Church as a crucial scaffolding that helps build the individual and the family see Conference Report Oct 1967 107 The Church is the kingdom of God on earth but in the kingdom of heaven families will be both the source of our eternal progress and joy and the order of our Heavenly Father As we are often reminded we will be released one day from our Church callings but if we are worthy we will never be released from our family relationships Joseph F Smith said There can be no genuine happiness separate and apart from the home and every effort made to sanctify and preserve its influence is uplifting to those who toil and sacrifice for its establishment Men and women often seek to substitute some other life for that of the home they would make themselves believe that the home means restraint that the highest liberty is the fullest opportunity to move about at will There is no happiness without service and there is no service greater than that which converts the home into a divine institution and which promotes and preserves family life Teachings of Presidents of the Church Joseph F Smith 1998 382 Now one may ask How do we protect and preserve and strengthen our homes and families in a world pulling so hard in opposite directions Let me make three simple suggestions Be consistent in holding daily family prayer and weekly family home evenings Both of these invite the Lord s Spirit which provides the help and power we need as parents and family leaders The Church curriculum and magazines have many good ideas for family home evening Also consider holding a family testimony meeting where parents and children can express their beliefs and feelings to each other in a private and personal setting Teach the gospel and basic values in your home Establish a love for reading the scriptures together Too many of our parents are abdicating this responsibility to the Church While seminary auxiliaries and priesthood quorums are important as a supplement to parental gospel instruction the main responsibility rests in the home You might want to choose one gospel subject or a family value and then watch for opportunities to teach it Be wise and do not involve children or yourselves in so many activities out of the home that you are so busy that the Spirit of the Lord cannot be recognized or felt in giving you the promised guidance for yourself and your family Create meaningful family bonds that give your children an identity stronger than what they can find with their peer group or at school or anyplace else This can be done through family traditions for birthdays for holidays for dinnertime and for Sundays It can also be done through family policies and rules with natural and well understood consequences Have a simple family economy where children have specific chores or household duties and receive praise or other rewards commensurate to how well they do Teach them the importance of avoiding debt and of earning saving and wisely spending money Help them learn responsibility for their own temporal and spiritual self reliance In today s world where Satan s aggression against the family is so prevalent parents must do all they can to fortify and defend their families But their efforts may not be enough Our most basic institution of family desperately needs help and support from the extended family and the public institutions that surround us Brothers and sisters aunts and uncles grandparents and cousins can make a powerful difference in the lives of children Remember that the expression of love and encouragement from an extended family member will often provide the right influence and help a child at a critical time The Church itself will continue to be the first and foremost institution the scaffolding as it were to help build strong families I can assure you that those who lead the Church have great concern about the well being of your families and thus you will see increasing efforts to prioritize and to focus on family needs But as your leaders we call upon members of the Church everywhere to put family first and to identify specific ways to strengthen their individual families Further we call upon all public institutions to examine themselves and to do less that might harm families and more that will help them We call upon the media to offer more that promotes traditional family values and is uplifting and supportive of families and less that popularizes immorality and materialism We call upon government and political leaders to put the needs of children and parents first and to think in terms of family impact in all legislation and policy making We call upon Internet providers and Web site creators to become more responsible regarding their potential for influence and to adopt the conscious objective of protecting children from violence pornography filth and sleaze We call upon educational entities to teach universal values and family and parenting skills supporting parents in their responsibility to raise children to become the leaders of families in generations yet to come We call upon our own Church members to reach out in love to neighbors and friends of other faiths and include them in the use of the many resources the Church has to help families Our communities and neighborhoods will be safer and stronger as people of all faiths work together to strengthen families It is important to remember that all larger units of society depend on the smallest and most fundamental unit the family No matter who or what we are we help ourselves when we help families Brothers and sisters as we hold up like a banner the proclamation to the world on the family and as we live and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ we will fulfill the measure of our creation here on earth We will find peace and happiness here and in the world to come We should not need a hurricane or other crisis to remind us of what matters most The gospel and the Lord s plan of happiness and salvation should remind us What matters most is what lasts longest and our families are for eternity Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters a few weeks ago Sister Ballard and I enjoyed speaking to the missionaries at the Provo Missionary Training Center We were thrilled to see their radiant eager faces and feel the presence of the Spirit of the Lord These fine missionaries are well on their way to carrying the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world We thank parents bishops stake presidents and especially our young people for responding to the prophet s call for more thorough spiritual preparation to serve the Lord As we raised the bar for missionary service President Gordon B Hinckley said This work is rigorous It demands strength and vitality It demands mental sharpness and capacity It demands faith desire and consecration It demands clean hands and a pure heart He went on to say The time has come when we must raise the standards of those who are called as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ We simply cannot permit those who have not qualified themselves as to worthiness to go into the world to speak the glad tidings of the gospel Missionary Service Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting Jan 11 2003 17 Today we call for more qualified missionaries young men who have prepared to serve by accepting the challenge of our prophet to practice self discipline to live above the low standards of the world to avoid transgression and take the high road in all their activities Missionary Service 17 The work of the Lord in our 339 missions is expanding so we must increase our efforts to see that every 12 year old young man is worthily ordained a deacon every 14 year old a teacher every 16 year old a priest and that every 18 to 19 year old worthily receives the Melchizedek Priesthood We can do this by filling the hearts of our young men with love for the Lord understanding and appreciation of His Atonement and a clear vision of the marvel of the Restoration When our youth understand the significance of the Restoration of the gospel and know for themselves that God is our Heavenly Father and He loves all of His children that Jesus is the Christ and that together They personally visited Joseph Smith to open this the final dispensation of time they will want to help carry this message to the world When our youth see the Book of Mormon as tangible evidence that the message of the Restoration is true they will be filled with a desire to do their part in teaching these truths to our Heavenly Father s children We learned from the missionaries at the Missionary Training Center what would have helped them most to prepare for their mission Above all else they wished they had Learned the doctrine better through focused scripture study Learned how to study and to pray sincerely Understood better what is expected Had more teaching opportunities And had more searching interviews by bishops and parents Brothers and sisters together we can teach the gospel of Jesus Christ in its simplicity and power to all of our youth in the Church Working with parents we can help them prepare for a mission and a lifetime of service Let us go forward to search for every one of our precious youth regardless of their activity level illuminating the Light of Christ that is within them President Boyd K Packer said The Light of Christ is as universal as sunlight itself Wherever there is human life there is the Spirit of Christ Every living soul is possessed of it It is the inspirer of everything that will bless and benefit mankind It nourishes goodness itself The Light of Christ Liahona and Ensign Apr 2005 13 So we know that all have within them the Light of Christ Our responsibility as parents teachers and leaders is to kindle that light in our youth until the flame of testimony burns deep within their hearts and souls and then to encourage each one of them to take that flame and use it to help kindle the Light of Christ in others Of course the adversary knows this and is working overtime to influence some of our youth to disregard the teachings of the Church That is why parents leaders and teachers need to counsel together and know every young man and young woman every one Whether they are active or not we need to know them It is true that the bar has been raised for our missionaries This means that the bar has been raised for parents and leaders as well We will need to increase our faith and expand our efforts to give every young man the opportunity to serve President Hinckley also expressed this concern We need more missionaries The message to raise the bar on missionary qualifications was not a signal to send fewer missionaries but a call for parents and leaders to work with young men earlier to better prepare them for missionary service and to keep them worthy of such service All young men who are worthy and who are physically and emotionally able should prepare to serve in this most important work To the Bishops of the Church Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting June 19 2004 27 Similarly with reference to young women the President said There has been some misunderstanding of earlier counsel regarding single sisters serving as missionaries We need some young women They perform a remarkable work They can get in homes where the elders cannot But it should be kept in mind that young sisters are not under obligation to go on missions They should not feel that they have a duty comparable to that of young men but some will wish to go To the Bishops of the Church 27 Brothers and sisters there is an incredible amount of work that needs to be done The Spirit of the Lord is brooding over many of the nations of the world Doors previously locked are opening to us We need more hardworking testimony enriched missionaries in order to reach more of our Heavenly Father s children who are now at a place where we can reach them These are our brothers and sisters and we have the responsibility to teach them the message of the Restoration We know that great things happen in the lives of those who faithfully serve full time missions Missionary service is not easy but it is infinitely worth it Those who serve and return home with honor have established a pattern of living and serving that will bless their own lives and the lives of generations to follow They return better prepared to be strong leaders and teachers in the organizations of the Church They return better prepared to be righteous fathers and mothers and able to teach their children the gospel Full time missionary service is a blessing for those whom the missionaries find and teach as well as for the missionaries themselves Now we have a special request for you bishops and branch presidents We are aware that you already know those who have cleared the bar and are preparing to accept mission calls during this year What we are asking leaders in every unit to do is to counsel together with parents and pray to find at least one more young man above those already committed who can be called to serve If the over 26 000 wards and branches in the Church will send all of those whom they are already planning to send into the mission field plus one more the ranks of our full time missionaries will swell and we will move much closer to our divine mandate to take the gospel to every nation kindred tongue and people Of course these missionaries need to be worthy faithful healthy and fully committed Perhaps this one more may not be ready right now So we ask parents and stake and ward council members to rely upon the discerning power of the Holy Spirit to know whom you can help to be ready for a call this year As you reach out to them please remember the experience of a friend of mine He had never owned a horse in his life until he married a wonderful woman who loves horses Wanting to impress his new bride he announced one evening that he was going to the pasture to teach a colt how to be led He weighed more than the colt He knew more than the colt He assumed all he would need to do was pull on the lead rope and sooner or later the colt would follow He was confident that the process would be short and simple He attached the lead rope to the halter got in front of the colt and pulled The colt resisted My friend pulled harder and the colt planted his legs more firmly So he really pulled and the colt fell over The process was repeated several times until my friend made this assessment in just four or five minutes he had successfully taught the colt to fall over All he had to do was get in front of the colt pick up the rope and over it would go His wife watching this process finally suggested that instead of getting in front of the colt and pulling he might try wrapping the rope around the colt and simply walking alongside To my friend s chagrin it worked There seems to be something inside each of us that resists being told or pushed or pulled But if someone puts an arm around a young man and walks alongside him he is likely to follow along with a desire to serve Please remember this as you strengthen the testimony of one more who can serve May I make three suggestions for your consideration to help establish a rich tradition of missionary service in your family stakes wards or branches First make sure all of our youth understand who they are From their earliest days in Primary our children sing I Am a Child of God Hymns no 301 Help them to know what it really means to be a child of God Remind them that they are here at this particular time in the history of the world with the fulness of the gospel at their fingertips because they made valiant choices in the premortal existence Our youth need to stand firm for righteousness and truth They need the vision of the blessings that can be theirs as they demonstrate their love for Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ through their willingness to serve Second teach the doctrine While activities and social events have their appropriate place in our overall youth program it is the doctrine that converts and commits Our youth have a right to expect that their parents and Church leaders and teachers will see that they know and understand the gospel of Jesus Christ The Holy Ghost will confirm the truth to their hearts and will ignite the Light of Christ in their souls And then you will have one more fully prepared missionary Yesterday Elder Richard G Scott suggested that Preach My Gospel the new guide that our missionaries are now using to teach the gospel can be a good resource to help you Finally we recognize that it may not be wise for some of our young men and young women to face the rigors and challenges of a full time mission If priesthood leaders excuse any of you from full time missionary service we ask you and your families to accept the decision and move forward You can prepare to participate in the saving ordinances of the temple and find other ways to be of service And we ask all of our members to be supportive and to show great love and understanding in assisting all of our faithful youth in their various Church callings Brothers and sisters I add my testimony of the divine mission of the Lord Jesus Christ and pray that He will bless all of us in our efforts to inspire and motivate more of our youth and couples to serve a full time mission In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I recently returned from an assignment in Asia where we met with faithful Saints and missionaries One meeting was in a metropolitan area where we have approximately 14 000 Church members living within a population of nearly 21 million people If that same ratio were applied to this meeting in the Conference Center we would have only 13 members of the Church scattered among this congregation of over 20 000 This experience impressed upon me how deeply grateful we must all be to know that after ages of darkness and apostasy Joseph Smith beheld a remarkable vision of the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove Clearly in our world today it is a rare and precious thing to have a testimony that God our Heavenly Father lives that His Son Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer and that priesthood authority to administer the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored once again upon the earth The profound blessing of having a testimony of these truths cannot be measured or ever taken for granted Personal testimony is the foundation of our faith It is the binding power that makes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints unique in the lives of its members as compared with all other religious denominations of the world The doctrine of the Restoration is glorious in and of itself but the thing that makes it powerful and imbues it with great meaning is the personal testimonies of Church members worldwide who accept the Restoration of the gospel and strive to live its teachings every day of their lives A testimony is a witness or confirmation of eternal truth impressed upon individual hearts and souls through the Holy Ghost whose primary ministry is to testify of truth particularly as it relates to the Father and the Son When one receives a testimony of truth through this divinely appointed process it immediately begins to have impact on that person s life According to Alma the Younger it will begin to swell within your breasts and when you feel these swelling motions ye will begin to say within yourselves the word is good for it beginneth to enlarge my soul yea it beginneth to enlighten my understanding yea it beginneth to be delicious to me Alma 32 28 Simply stated testimony real testimony born of the Spirit and confirmed by the Holy Ghost changes lives It changes how you think and what you do It changes what you say It affects every priority you set and every choice you make To have a real and abiding testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to be spiritually born of God to receive his image in your countenances and to experience a mighty change in your hearts Alma 5 14 Like almost everything else in life testimonies grow and develop through experience and service We often hear some members and especially children bear their testimonies listing things for which they are thankful their love of family the Church their teachers their friends For them the gospel is something that they are grateful for because it makes them feel happy and secure This is a good beginning but testimonies need to be much more They need to be anchored very early to the first principles of the gospel A testimony of the reality of Heavenly Father s love of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ and of the effect of His Atonement on every son and daughter of God brings about the desire to repent and live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost It also brings a confirmation to our soul of the Restoration of the gospel in these latter days Real testimony of these precious truths comes as a witness by the Holy Ghost after sincere and dedicated effort including teaching in the home prayer scripture study service to others and diligent obedience to Heavenly Father s commandments To gain and forever hold on to a testimony of gospel truths is worth whatever price in spiritual preparation we may be required to pay My experience throughout the Church leads me to worry that too many of our members testimonies linger on I am thankful and I love and too few are able to say with humble but sincere clarity I know As a result our meetings sometimes lack the testimony rich spiritual underpinnings that stir the soul and have meaningful positive impact on the lives of all those who hear them Our testimony meetings need to be more centered on the Savior the doctrines of the gospel the blessings of the Restoration and the teachings of the scriptures We need to replace stories travelogues and lectures with pure testimonies Those who are entrusted to speak and teach in our meetings need to do so with doctrinal power that will be both heard and felt lifting the spirits and edifying our people You will remember at the heart of King Benjamin s powerful sermon to his people was his personal witness of the Savior who at that time had yet to be born into mortality At one point in the king s sermon when he had just borne witness to the people The Spirit of the Lord came upon them and they were filled with joy because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come Mosiah 4 3 And that is because the Spirit cannot be restrained when pure testimony of Christ is borne Thus King Benjamin s people were so inspired by his testimony that their lives were changed right there on the spot and they became as new people Remember also Abinadi and Alma Abinadi infuriated wicked King Noah with his courageous testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ Eventually this great missionary offered the ultimate sacrifice for his witness and faith but not before his pure testimony touched one believing heart Alma one of King Noah s priests repented of his sins accepted Jesus as the Christ and went about privately among the people and began to teach the words of Abinadi Mosiah 18 1 Many were converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ as a direct result of Abinadi s powerfully borne testimony of the Savior believed by one soul Alma The Apostle Paul also bore fervent testimony of Christ and converted many through his missionary labors He did not shrink in bearing his testimony before King Agrippa So mighty were his words that even this influential representative of the Roman Empire was moved to exclaim Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian Acts 26 28 The lesson I believe is clear having a testimony alone is not enough In fact when we are truly converted we cannot be restrained from testifying And as it was with Apostles and faithful members of old so is it also our privilege our duty and our solemn obligation to declare the things which we know to be true D C 80 4 Again please keep in mind that we are talking about sharing real testimony not just speaking generally about the things we are thankful for While it is always good to express love and gratitude such expressions do not constitute the kind of testimony that will ignite a fire of belief in the lives of others To bear testimony is to bear witness by the power of the Holy Ghost to make a solemn declaration of truth based on personal knowledge or belief Guide to the Scriptures Testify 241 Clear declaration of truth makes a difference in people s lives That is what changes hearts That is what the Holy Ghost can confirm in the hearts of God s children Although we can have testimonies of many things as members of the Church there are basic truths we need to constantly teach one another and share with those not of our faith Testify God is our Father and Jesus is the Christ The plan of salvation is centered on the Savior s Atonement Joseph Smith restored the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon is evidence that our testimony is true Miraculous things happen when members join with missionaries and share pure testimony with those who are not members of the Church For example while many people were touched by Alma s testimony in the land of Ammonihah when Amulek stood and added his testimony to Alma s the people began to be astonished seeing there was more than one witness who testified Alma 10 12 The same thing can happen with us today As we stand together the Lord will help us find many more of His sheep who will know His voice as we unitedly share our testimonies with them Many years ago Brigham Young told of an early missionary in the Church who was asked to share his testimony with a large group of people According to President Young this particular elder never had been able to say that he knew Joseph Smith was a Prophet He would have preferred to just say a prayer and leave but the circumstances made that impossible So he started to speak and as soon as he got Joseph out is a Prophet was next and from that his tongue was loosened and he continued talking until near sun down President Young used this experience to teach that the Lord pours out His Spirit upon a man when he testifies that which the Lord gives him to testify of Millennial Star supplement 1853 30 The Prophet s brother Hyrum understood this and testified fearlessly of divine truth as it had been revealed to his brother Joseph and confirmed in his own heart His testimony blessed the lives of many including Parley P Pratt When Parley first encountered the Book of Mormon Hyrum took him into his own home and spent the night teaching and testifying to him He bore witness of the prophetic mantle that rested upon Joseph and of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon Shortly thereafter Hyrum set aside his own needs and went with Parley to honor his request for baptism see Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt ed Parley P Pratt Jr 1938 35 42 We may never fully comprehend or be able to measure the far reaching effects of Hyrum s one on one testimony to Parley P Pratt In addition to Parley s faithful posterity his apostolic witness and missionary service drew countless souls into the kingdom of God Interestingly included among those who joined the Church as a direct result of his ministry in Canada were Joseph Fielding and his sisters Mary and Mercy After his first wife Jerusha died Hyrum met and married Mary Fielding and from their marriage came President Joseph F Smith and countless other members and Church leaders Now I realize that not all testimonies will return such a blessing as Hyrum s did Joseph Kimber a humble new convert in Thatcham England bore his simple testimony to a fellow farmhand I believe Brother Kimber s witness of Joseph Smith and the Restoration is what ignited the fire of belief in 17 year old Henry Ballard s heart and caused him to ask to be baptized Generations of the Ballard family are the beneficiaries of that humble testimony Members and missionaries in our day can have the experience of converting others by living our lives as best we can and being prepared to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places Mosiah 18 9 A friend recently told me about being on a 90 minute bus ride in Brazil He felt impressed to go to the back of the bus to speak to the young people who had been serving as guides for his group of businessmen An associate of his father followed him to the back of the bus and heard his testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel This man later said When I heard your testimony I had the distinct feeling go through my whole body that these things were true He and his wife will soon be baptized The missionaries are now preparing to teach the lessons not as memorized dialogue or a rote presentation but rather they will outline gospel principles in an organized way calling upon the Spirit to direct how they communicate gospel truth to investigators spirit to spirit and heart to heart Brothers and sisters join together with the missionaries in sharing your precious testimony every day witnessing at every opportunity the glorious message of the Restoration The fire of your testimony is all that you need in order to introduce the gospel to many more of our Father s children Trust in the Lord and never underestimate the impact your testimony can have upon the lives of others as you bear it with the power of the Spirit Doubt and fear are tools of Satan The time has come for all of us to overcome any fear and boldly take every opportunity to share our testimonies of the gospel May the Lord bless you as you continue to nurture your testimonies through your prayers your personal gospel study and your acts of service With great joy I humbly testify our Heavenly Father loves us Jesus is the Christ Joseph Smith restored the fulness of the everlasting gospel and the Book of Mormon testifies of these truths We are led by a living prophet today And I pray that the Lord may bless you my dear brothers and sisters as you teach and testify which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
This past January our family suffered the tragic loss of our grandson Nathan in an airplane crash Nathan had served in the Russian speaking Baltic Mission He loved the people and knew it was a privilege to serve the Lord Three months after I officiated at his eternal marriage to his sweetheart Jennifer this accident took his life Nathan s being taken so suddenly from our mortal presence has turned each of our hearts and minds to the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ While it is impossible for me to put into words the full meaning of the Atonement of Christ I pray that I can explain what His Atonement means to me and our family and what it might also mean to you and yours The Savior s precious birth life Atonement in the Garden of Gethsemane suffering on the cross burial in Joseph s tomb and glorious Resurrection all became a renewed reality for us The Savior s Resurrection assures all of us that someday we too will follow Him and experience our own resurrection What peace what comfort this great gift is which comes through the loving grace of Jesus Christ the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind Because of Him we know we can be with Nathan again There is no greater expression of love than the heroic Atonement performed by the Son of God Were it not for the plan of our Heavenly Father established before the world began in a very real sense all mankind past present and future would have been left without the hope of eternal progression As a result of Adam s transgression mortals were separated from God see Rom 6 23 and would be forever unless a way was found to break the bands of death This would not be easy for it required the vicarious sacrifice of one who was sinless and who could therefore take upon Himself the sins of all mankind Thankfully Jesus Christ courageously fulfilled this sacrifice in ancient Jerusalem There in the quiet isolation of the Garden of Gethsemane He knelt among the gnarled olive trees and in some incredible way that none of us can fully comprehend the Savior took upon Himself the sins of the world Even though His life was pure and free of sin He paid the ultimate penalty for sin yours mine and everyone who has ever lived His mental emotional and spiritual anguish were so great they caused Him to bleed from every pore see Luke 22 44 D C 19 18 And yet Jesus suffered willingly so that we might all have the opportunity to be washed clean through having faith in Him repenting of our sins being baptized by proper priesthood authority receiving the purifying gift of the Holy Ghost by confirmation and accepting all other essential ordinances Without the Atonement of the Lord none of these blessings would be available to us and we could not become worthy and prepared to return to dwell in the presence of God The Savior later endured the agony of inquisition cruel beatings and death by crucifixion on the cross at Calvary Recently there has been a great deal of commentary about this none of which has made clear the singular point that no one had the power to take the Savior s life from Him He gave it as a ransom for us all As the Son of God He had the power to alter the situation Yet the scriptures clearly state that He yielded Himself to scourging humiliation suffering and finally crucifixion because of His great love towards the children of men see 1 Ne 19 9 10 The Atonement of Jesus Christ was an indispensable part of our Heavenly Father s plan for His Son s earthly mission and for our salvation How grateful we should be that our Heavenly Father did not intercede but rather withheld His fatherly instinct to rescue His Beloved Son Because of His eternal love for you and for me He allowed Jesus to complete His foreordained mission to become our Redeemer The gift of resurrection and immortality is given freely through the loving grace of Jesus Christ to all people of all ages regardless of their good or evil acts And to those who choose to love the Lord and who show their love and faith in Him by keeping His commandments and qualifying for the full blessings of the Atonement He offers the additional promise of exaltation and eternal life which is the blessing of living in the presence of God and His Beloved Son forever We often sing a hymn that expresses what I feel when I consider the Savior s benevolent atoning sacrifice I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me I tremble to know that for me he was crucified That for me a sinner he suffered he bled and died Jesus Christ the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind is not dead He lives the resurrected Son of God lives that is my testimony and He guides the affairs of His Church today In the spring of 1820 a pillar of light illuminated a grove of trees in upstate New York Our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith This experience began the restoration of powerful doctrinal truths that had been lost for centuries Among those truths that had been dimmed by the darkness of apostasy was the stirring reality that we are all the spirit sons and daughters of a loving God who is our Father We are part of His family He is not a father in some allegorical or poetic sense He is literally the Father of our spirits He cares for each one of us Though this world has a way of diminishing and demeaning men and women the reality is we are all of royal divine lineage In that unprecedented appearance of the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove the very first word spoken by the Father of us all was the personal name of Joseph Such is our Father s personal relationship with each of us He knows our names and yearns for us to become worthy to return to live with Him Through the Prophet Joseph Smith came the Restoration of the gospel The Lord Jesus Christ has once again revealed through His chosen prophet the ordinances and the priesthood authority to administer them for the salvation of all who will believe Another prophet in another time was shown the nations of the earth Moses 7 23 And the Lord showed Enoch all things even unto the end of the world Moses 7 67 Enoch saw also that Satan had a great chain in his hand and it veiled the whole face of the earth with darkness and he Satan looked up and laughed Moses 7 26 With all that Enoch beheld there was one thing that seemed to capture his attention above everything else Enoch saw God look upon the residue of the people and He wept Moses 7 28 The sacred record then has Enoch asking God over and over How is it that thou canst weep How is it thou canst weep Moses 7 29 31 The Lord answered Enoch Behold these thy brethren they are the workmanship of mine own hands unto thy brethren have I also given commandment that they should love one another and that they should choose me their Father but behold they are without affection and they hate their own blood Moses 7 32 33 Enoch saw the conditions of these latter days He and other early prophets knew that only as we accept the Atonement in our lives and strive to live the gospel can we meet the challenges of life and find peace joy and happiness Coming to understand this great gift is an individual pursuit for each child of God Brothers and sisters I believe that if we could truly understand the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ we would realize how precious is one son or daughter of God I believe our Heavenly Father s everlasting purpose for His children is generally achieved by the small and simple things we do for one another At the heart of the English word atonement is the word one If all mankind understood this there would never be anyone with whom we would not be concerned regardless of age race gender religion or social or economic standing We would strive to emulate the Savior and would never be unkind indifferent disrespectful or insensitive to others If we truly understood the Atonement and the eternal value of each soul we would seek out the wayward boy and girl and every other wayward child of God We would help them to know of the love Christ has for them We would do all that we can to help prepare them to receive the saving ordinances of the gospel Surely if the Atonement of Christ was foremost in the minds of ward and branch leaders no new or reactivated member would ever be neglected Because every soul is so precious leaders will counsel together to see that each one is taught the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ When I think of Nathan and how precious he is to us I can see and feel more clearly how our Heavenly Father must feel about all of His children We do not want God to weep because we did not do all we could to share with His children the revealed truths of the gospel I pray that every one of our youth will seek to know the blessings of the Atonement and that they will strive to be worthy to serve the Lord in the mission field Surely many more senior couples and others whose health will permit would eagerly desire to serve the Lord as missionaries if they would ponder over the meaning of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ It was Jesus who said If you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people and bring save it be one soul unto me how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father D C 18 15 emphasis added Not only that but great shall be the Lord s joy in the soul that repenteth For precious unto Him is the one Brothers and sisters our Heavenly Father has reached out to us through the Atonement of our Savior He invites all to come unto Christ who is the Holy One of Israel and partake of his salvation and the power of his redemption Omni 1 26 He has taught us that it is through our faithful adherence to gospel principles through receiving the saving ordinances that have been restored through continual service and by enduring to the end that we can return to His sacred presence What possible thing in the whole world is remotely as important as to know this Sadly in today s world a person s importance is often judged by the size of the audience before which he or she performs That is how media and sports programs are rated how corporate prominence is sometimes determined and often how governmental rank is obtained That may be why roles such as father mother and missionary seldom receive standing ovations Fathers mothers and missionaries play before very small audiences Yet in the eyes of the Lord there may be only one size of audience that is of lasting importance and that is just one each one you and me and each one of the children of God The irony of the Atonement is that it is infinite and eternal yet it is applied individually one person at a time There is a level at which the child s hymn I Am a Child of God Hymns no 301 harmonizes with the music of eternity We are children of God Each one of us is precious to the point of bringing the Lord God Almighty to a fulness of joy if we are faithful or to tears if we are not As the resurrected Savior said to the Nephites so He might say to us today Blessed are ye because of your faith And now behold my joy is full And when he had said these words he wept and the multitude bare record of it and he took their little children one by one and blessed them and prayed unto the Father for them 3 Ne 17 20 21 emphasis added Brothers and sisters never never underestimate how precious is the one Remember always the simple admonition of the Lord If ye love me keep my commandments John 14 15 Always strive to live worthy of the sacred full blessings of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ In our sorrow over the separation from our dear Nathan has come the peace that only the Savior and Redeemer can give Our family has turned to Him one by one and we now sing with greater appreciation and understanding Oh it is wonderful that he should care for meEnough to die for me Oh it is wonderful wonderful to me My dear brothers and sisters may you give to others and receive for yourselves every blessing the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ offers I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The fall of the year is when television airs its season premieres and introduces its new shows A friend told me that there are 37 new TV series being inaugurated this fall As he has read the reviews he has found few if any of them that he would want his children to watch Most of the sitcoms dramas and reality shows contain immorality violence and subtle ridicule of traditional values and traditional families Each year the new shows seem to get worse pushing the envelope of what the public will accept What comes out of Hollywood off the Internet and in much of today s music creates a web of decadence that can trap our children and endanger all of us Church leaders have the responsibility to speak out on moral issues and to counsel individuals and families The family is the basic unit of society it is the basic unit of eternity Thus when forces threaten the family Church leaders must respond The family is at the heart of Heavenly Father s plan because we are all part of His family and because mortality is our opportunity to form our own families and to assume the role of parents It is within our families that we learn unconditional love which can come to us and draw us very close to God s love It is within families that values are taught and character is built Father and mother are callings from which we will never be released and there is no more important stewardship than the responsibility we have for God s spirit children who come into our families Within this context of the preeminent importance of families and the threats families face today it is not surprising that the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles used strong words in the proclamation to the world on families We warn that individuals who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God Further we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets 1 One such prophet was Malachi who admonished parents to turn their hearts to their children and children to their parents lest the whole earth be cursed see Mal 4 6 To these warnings ancient as the Old Testament and current as the proclamation on the family I add my own voice of warning specifically concerning today s media and the powerful negative effect it can have on families and on family life Because of its sheer size media today presents vast and sharply contrasting options Opposite from its harmful and permissive side media offers much that is positive and productive Television offers history channels discovery channels education channels One can still find movies and TV comedies and dramas that entertain and uplift and accurately depict the consequences of right and wrong The Internet can be a fabulous tool of information and communication and there is an unlimited supply of good music in the world Thus our biggest challenge is to choose wisely what we listen to and what we watch As the prophet Lehi said because of Christ and His Atonement we are free forever knowing good from evil able to act for ourselves rather than be acted upon free to choose liberty and eternal life or to choose captivity and death 2 Ne 2 26 27 The choices we make in media can be symbolic of the choices we make in life Choosing the trendy the titillating the tawdry in the TV programs or movies we watch can cause us to end up if we re not careful choosing the same things in the lives we live If we do not make good choices the media can devastate our families and pull our children away from the narrow gospel path In the virtual reality and the perceived reality of large and small screens family destructive viewpoints and behavior are regularly portrayed as pleasurable as stylish as exciting and as normal Often media s most devastating attacks on family are not direct or frontal or openly immoral Intelligent evil is too cunning for that knowing that most people still profess belief in family and in traditional values Rather the attacks are subtle and amoral issues of right and wrong don t even come up Immorality and sexual innuendo are everywhere causing some to believe that because everyone is doing it it must be all right This pernicious evil is not out in the street somewhere it is coming right into our homes right into the heart of our families To be strong and happy families need to be nourished by the truths depicted in the thirteenth article of faith by a belief in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men A of F 1 13 Gratefully there are many like minded men and women of all cultures and faiths who also seek that which is virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy But we live in the perilous times to which the Apostle Paul referred when he warned about our day as one when men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection false accusers despisers of those that are good heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God 2 Tim 3 1 4 Conspiring men and women intent on gain rather than goodness stir up the people to all manner of wickedness see Alma 11 20 preventing the noble uses to which the media could be employed The new morality preached from the media s pulpit is nothing more than the old immorality It attacks religion It undermines the family It turns virtue into vice and vice into virtue It assaults the senses and batters the soul with messages and images that are neither virtuous nor lovely nor of good report nor praiseworthy The time has come when members of the Church need to speak out and join with the many other concerned people in opposition to the offensive destructive and mean spirited media influence that is sweeping over the earth According to the Kaiser Family Foundation the percentage of television prime time shows with sexual content jumped from 67 percent in 1998 to 75 percent in the year 2000 2 Media with this kind of content has numerous negative effects It fosters a callous attitude toward women who are often portrayed as objects of abuse and not as precious daughters of God who are essential to His eternal plan The long cherished values of abstinence from intimate relationships before marriage and complete fidelity between husband and wife after marriage are denigrated and derided Children and youth are confused and misled by the deviant behavior they see demonstrated by so called stars they admire and want to emulate In the moral confusion created by the media enduring values are being abandoned We see a rapid increase in cyberporn involving sexual addiction over the Internet Some become so addicted to viewing Internet pornography and participating in dangerous online chat rooms that they ignore their marriage covenants and family obligations and often put their employment at risk Many run afoul of the law Others develop a tolerance to their perverted behavior taking ever more risks to feed their immoral addiction Marriages crumble and relationships fail as addicts often lose everything of real eternal value According to one social observer Television has replaced the family the school and the church in that order as the principal instrument for socialization and transmission of values Greed debauchery violence unlimited self gratification absence of moral restraint are the daily fare glamorously dished up to our children 3We must be concerned with the violent and sexually charged lyrics of much of today s popular music and the relatively new art form of the music video According to industry observers 40 percent of the music video audience is under the age of 18 4 One study reports that approximately three fourths of all the music videos that tell a story utilize sexual imagery and nearly half involve violence 5 And the fashion trends spawned in their images are about as far away from being virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy as you can get Ours surely is a time when men call evil good and good evil Isa 5 20 Let me say again that the family is the main target of evil s attack and must therefore be the main point of our protection and defense As I said once before when you stop and think about it from a diabolically tactical point of view fighting the family makes sense to Satan When he wants to disrupt the work of the Lord he doesn t poison the world s peanut butter supply thus bringing the Church s missionary system to its collective knees He doesn t send a plague of laryngitis to afflict the Mormon Tabernacle Choir He doesn t legislate against green Jell O and casseroles When evil wants to strike out and disrupt the essence of God s work it attacks the family It does so by attempting to disregard the law of chastity to confuse gender to desensitize violence to make crude and blasphemous language the norm and to make immoral and deviant behavior seem like the rule rather than the exception We need to remember Edmund Burke s statement The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing 6 We need to raise our voices with other concerned citizens throughout the world in opposition to current trends We need to tell the sponsors of offensive media that we have had enough We need to support programs and products that are positive and uplifting Joining together with neighbors and friends who share our concerns we can send a clear message to those responsible The Internet Web sites and their local affiliates will have their addresses Letters and e mails have more effect than most people realize especially those like one sent by a Relief Society sister that stated I represent a group of over a hundred women that meets every week and often talks about the harm your program is doing to our children Of course the most basic way to protest negative impact media is simply not to watch it see it read it or play it We should teach our family members to follow the First Presidency s counsel to young people From the For the Strength of Youth pamphlet their instruction regarding entertainment and the media is very clear Do not attend view or participate in entertainment that is vulgar immoral violent or pornographic in any way Do not participate in entertainment that in any way presents immorality or violent behavior as acceptable Have the courage to walk out of a movie or video party turn off a computer or television change a radio station or put down a magazine if what is being presented does not meet Heavenly Father s standards Do these things even if others do not 7Brothers and sisters refuse to be used Refuse to be manipulated Refuse to support those programs that violate traditional family values We may be a small voice to begin with nevertheless let us speak out and encourage a more uplifting inspiring and acceptable media Besides making our voices heard let me conclude with seven things that every parent can do to minimize the negative effect media can have on our families We need to hold family councils and decide what our media standards are going to be We need to spend enough quality time with our children that we are consistently the main influence in their lives not the media or any peer group We need to make good media choices ourselves and set good examples for our children We need to limit the amount of time our children watch TV or play video games or use the Internet each day Virtual reality must not become their reality We need to use Internet filters and TV programming locks to prevent our children from chancing upon things they should not see We need to have TVs and computers in a much used common room in the home not in a bedroom or a private place We need to take time to watch appropriate media with our children and discuss with them how to make choices that will uplift and build rather than degrade and destroy May God bless us with courage and wisdom in doing what each one of us can to help turn the tide in the media away from darkness toward truth and light And may God bless our families to be strong and true to the principles of the gospel is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters Easter is a time when the Christian world focuses on and rejoices in the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ That one moment in time changed everything forever The Savior broke down every barrier that stood in the way of our return to a loving Heavenly Father In return He asks that we go and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world Matt 28 19 20 A more intimate version of the same message is recorded in the Gospel of John On the shore of the Sea of Galilee Jesus asked Peter three times Lovest thou me Each time Peter s reply was the same Thou knowest that I love thee And each time the Savior instructed Peter Feed my lambs Feed my sheep Feed my sheep John 21 15 17 The Savior s impassioned charge to feed His sheep continues in force today Like Peter and his brethren of old the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ today have the charge to take the gospel to all the world This charge is seldom far from our minds Every General Authority has the responsibility to be a missionary But the Savior was not just talking to the Apostles He was also talking to every person who has been blessed to hear the gospel and is a member of His Church In revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord puts it in very simple terms It becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor D C 88 81 During the last general conference we challenged our young men to better prepare themselves to serve the Lord Jesus Christ We asked them to be worthy qualified spiritually energized missionaries With the unsettled conditions that exist in the world today they need to be the greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the Church See M Russell Ballard The Greatest Generation of Missionaries Ensign Nov 2002 46 Liahona Nov 2002 46 We don t expect them to be perfect but they need to be anxious willing and committed to serve so they can reach new levels of spirituality as gospel teachers They need to know the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and teach it with power in their own words under the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit Throughout the Church we are working hard to help all of our missionaries to increase their spiritual maturity This worldwide effort has been referred to as raising the bar or raising the standard We thank you parents bishops and stake presidents for your support in this effort We also thank the faithful youth of the Church for your willingness to live up to the Lord s standard May our Heavenly Father continue to bless you as you prepare to serve Him in this troubled world But as we raise the level of expectation for the performance of our missionaries we must also raise the level of expectation for the performance of all of the members of the Church in fulfilling our missionary duties We need your help brothers and sisters to support and assist our missionaries in finding and baptizing many more of our Heavenly Father s children We need you to watch over protect and inspire the missionaries who are servants of the Lord If the standard is to be raised it is raised for all of us We must be more faithful We must be more spiritually in tune We must prepare ourselves to assist the missionaries in finding those of our Heavenly Father s children who will embrace the message of the Restoration Remember brothers and sisters we re not marketing a product We re not selling anything We re not trying to impress anyone with our numbers or our growth We are members of the restored Church of Jesus Christ empowered and sent forth by the Lord Himself to find nourish and bring safely into His Church those who are seeking to know the truth Viewed from that eternal perspective what we are to do seems so simple and clear but I know that member missionary work can be challenging and sometimes frightening Please allow me to suggest three simple things that we can do to assist in this divinely commissioned responsibility First we should exercise our faith and pray individually and as families asking for help in finding ways to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Ask the Lord to open the way Prayerfully set a date with your family to have someone in your home for the missionaries to teach Remember brothers and sisters this is the Lord s Church Let Him guide you through constant prayer With a prayer in your heart talk to everyone you can Don t prejudge Don t withhold the good news from anyone Talk to everyone and trust in the promised power of the Spirit to give you the words you should say Let them make the decision to accept or reject your invitation Over time the Lord will put into your path those who are seeking the truth He is the Good Shepherd He knows His sheep and they will know His voice spoken through you and they will follow Him see John 10 President Gordon B Hinckley said It will be a great day when our people not only pray for the missionaries throughout the world but ask the Lord to help them to assist the missionaries who are laboring in their own ward Missionary Service First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting Jan 2003 19 Second leaders must lead by example The Spirit will prompt and guide you in finding those interested in our message Your personal worthiness will give you the courage and the spiritual power to inspire your members to actively help the missionaries Some years ago a faithful convert Brother George McLaughlin was called to preside over a small branch of 20 members in Farmingdale Maine He was a humble man driving a milk delivery truck for a living Through his fasting and earnest prayer the Spirit taught him what he and the members of his branch needed to do to help the Church grow in their area Through his great faith constant prayer and powerful example he taught his members how to share the gospel It s a marvelous story one of the great missionary stories of this dispensation In just one year there were 450 convert baptisms in the branch The next year there were an additional 200 converts President McLaughlin indicated My job as branch president was to teach the new converts how to be Mormons I had to teach them how to give talks and lessons in church I had to teach them how to teach the gospel to their children I trained the new members to become strong members Pretty simple Just five years later the Augusta Maine Stake was organized Much of the leadership of that new stake came from those converts in the Farmingdale Branch Now we might ask why there was such great success in those days and the answer may be because of the urgent need to strengthen the Church Let me assure you that that same urgency in all units of the Church is every bit as critical today as it was then The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have made it clear that missionary work is to be centered in the ward Stake presidents and bishops have the responsibility and accountability to help members find the pure in heart and prepare them for baptism and for a life of service within their wards and stakes President Hinckley has also said I would like to suggest that every bishop in the Church give as a motto to his people Let s all work to grow the ward Find the Lambs Feed the Sheep Ensign May 1999 106 Liahona July 1999 120 One bishop in the state of Washington has prayerfully followed that counsel This is what he is doing Through priesthood and auxiliary leaders the ward council coordinates missionary work in the ward Missionaries are invited to ward council meetings to discuss their work Members are assigned to attend investigator visits with the missionaries Members and missionaries also visit less active and part member families together Last year this ward baptized and confirmed 46 new members and retention of those members is very high Those who come into the Church or who return to activity in this ward already have friends because the priesthood and auxiliaries are involved in the conversion process by direction of the bishop through the ward council see Ward Council Is Secret of Centralia Ward Success Church News 1 Feb 2003 5 Bishops engage the whole ward in proclaiming the gospel You will see that the Lord will bless you and your members with many more converts and many more who will return to full activity Missionary work should not only be on the ward council agendas but also on elders quorum Relief Society and other quorum group and auxiliary agendas Emphasis should be placed on baptizing and retaining in activity fathers and mothers along with their children Thus the missionary work of priesthood and auxiliary leaders should be coordinated by the ward mission leader and the bishop through the ward council And by doing so converts will be fully active members in their wards Right now members have a special opportunity to share the gospel by using the Finding Faith in Christ DVD that was enclosed with your April 2003 Ensign magazine Invite your neighbors and friends to spend an evening with you during the Easter season sharing together the life ministry and glorious Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ It may also be appropriate to have the missionaries attend with you and teach how the Lord has restored His Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith Third member missionary work does not require the development of strategies or gimmicks It does require faith real faith and trust in the Lord It also requires genuine love The first great commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind The second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself Matt 22 37 39 So let the power of love guide us in sharing the gospel with family members friends neighbors business associates and any other people we encounter as we go through life Most everyone wants to enjoy peace and happiness That is a natural human desire People want to find answers to the problems they face This is increasingly true in the world we now live in Professional advancement increased income bigger homes or newer cars and recreational equipment do not bring lasting peace and happiness Happiness comes from understanding God and knowing that He has a plan for our eternal joy and peace Happiness comes from knowing and loving the Savior and living our lives in accordance with His teachings Happiness comes from strong family and Church relationships based on gospel values Some members say I m afraid to share the gospel because I might offend someone Experience has shown that people are not offended when the sharing is motivated by the spirit of love and concern How could anyone be offended when we say something like this I love the way my church helps me and then add whatever the Spirit directs It s when we appear only to be fulfilling an assignment and we fail to express real interest and love that we offend others Don t ever forget brothers and sisters that you and I have in our possession the very points of doctrine that will bring people to the Lord The restored gospel of Jesus Christ has within it the power to bring deep and abiding happiness to the human soul something that will be valued and cherished for the rest of time and for all eternity We are not just trying to get people to join our Church we are sharing with them the fulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ But as powerful as our message is it cannot be imposed or forced upon people It can only be shared heart to heart soul to soul spirit to spirit by being good neighbors and by caring and showing love We need to be watchful for one another and reach out to one another And as we do so we will radiate the gospel in our own lives and it will radiate to the people the blessings the gospel has to offer Let us follow the admonition of the Prophet Joseph Smith After all that has been said our greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel History of the Church 2 478 We can and we must do better brothers and sisters I pray that the Lord will grant to each one of us the faith and courage to increase our participation in supporting our full time missionaries in sharing the restored gospel with all of God s children throughout the world In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In one of the most powerful and instructive stories from the Book of Mormon the people of Ammon had covenanted never again to take up weapons for the shedding of blood But when they saw the danger and the many afflictions which the Nephites bore for them they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country Alma 53 13 Helaman and his brethren persuaded them to honor their covenant with the Lord The scriptural account doesn t tell us who first pointed out that their sons had not made the same covenant their parents had made I like to think that it was one of the young men who suggested the possibility that he and his peers be allowed to take up arms and call themselves Nephites And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites yea to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives Alma 53 16 17 This was an extraordinary task for a group of 2 000 young men but they were extraordinary young men According to the scriptural record They were exceedingly valiant for courage and also for strength and activity but behold this was not all they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted Yea they were men of truth and soberness for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him Alma 53 20 21 The rest of the story tells how these young men fought valiantly against the much older and much more experienced Lamanite army According to their leader Helaman They fought as if with the strength of God and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites that they did frighten them and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war Alma 56 56 Imagine that These inexperienced young men were so spiritually and physically prepared and so powerful that they frightened their foes into surrendering Although all 2 000 of the young men were wounded in battle at one time or another not one was killed see Alma 57 25 Again quoting Helaman And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe that there was a just God and whosoever did not doubt that they should be preserved by his marvelous power Alma 57 26 Brethren today we are fighting a battle that in many ways is more perilous more fraught with danger than the battle between the Nephites and the Lamanites Our enemy is cunning and resourceful We fight against Lucifer the father of all lies the enemy of all that is good and right and holy Truly we live in a time of which Paul prophesied when men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy Without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away 2 Tim 3 2 5 Does this sound familiar brethren To me it sounds like a night of prime time television These are perilous times We battle literally for the souls of men The enemy is unforgiving and relentless He is taking eternal prisoners at an alarming rate And he shows no sign of letting up While we are profoundly grateful for the many members of the Church who are doing great things in the battle for truth and right I must honestly tell you it still is not enough We need much more help And so as the people of Ammon looked to their sons for reinforcement in the war against the Lamanites we look to you my young brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood We need you Like Helaman s 2 000 stripling warriors you also are the spirit sons of God and you too can be endowed with power to build up and defend His kingdom We need you to make sacred covenants just as they did We need you to be meticulously obedient and faithful just as they were What we need now is the greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the Church We need worthy qualified spiritually energized missionaries who like Helaman s 2 000 stripling warriors are exceedingly valiant for courage and also for strength and activity and who are true at all times in whatsoever thing they are entrusted Alma 53 20 Listen to those words my young brethren valiant courage strength active true We don t need spiritually weak and semicommitted young men We don t need you to just fill a position we need your whole heart and soul We need vibrant thinking passionate missionaries who know how to listen to and respond to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit This isn t a time for spiritual weaklings We cannot send you on a mission to be reactivated reformed or to receive a testimony We just don t have time for that We need you to be filled with faith hope charity and love with an eye single to the glory of God D C 4 5 As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I call upon you to begin right now tonight to be fully and completely worthy Resolve and commit to yourselves and to God that from this moment forward you will strive diligently to keep your hearts hands and minds pure and unsullied from any kind of moral transgression Resolve to avoid pornography as you would avoid the most insidious disease for that is precisely what it is Resolve to completely abstain from tobacco alcohol and illegal drugs Resolve to be honest Resolve to be good citizens and to abide by the laws of the land in which you live Resolve that from this night forward you will never defile your body or use language that is vulgar and unbecoming to a bearer of the priesthood And that is not all we expect of you my young brethren We expect you to have an understanding and a solid testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ We expect you to work hard We expect you to be covenant makers and covenant keepers We expect you to be missionaries to match our glorious message Now these are high standards We understand that but we do not apologize for them They reflect the Lord s standards for you to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood to enter the temple to serve as missionaries and to be righteous husbands and fathers There s nothing new in them nothing you haven t heard before But tonight we call upon you our young brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood to rise up to measure up and to be fully prepared to serve the Lord Many of you are already on this track and we commend you for your worthiness and determination For those of you who are not let tonight be the beginning of your preparation process If you find yourself wanting in worthiness resolve to make the appropriate changes beginning right now If you think you need to talk to your father and your bishop about any sins you may have committed don t wait do it now They will help you to repent and change so you can take your place as a member of the greatest generation of missionaries Please understand this the bar that is the standard for missionary service is being raised The day of the repent and go missionary is over You know what I m talking about don t you my young brothers Some young men have the mistaken idea that they can be involved in sinful behavior and then repent when they re 18 1 2 so they can go on their mission at 19 While it is true that you can repent of sins you may or you may not qualify to serve It is far better to keep yourselves clean and pure and valiant by doing such simple things as Developing a meaningful prayer relationship with your Heavenly Father Keeping the Sabbath day holy Working and putting part of your earnings in a savings account Paying a full and honest tithing Limiting the amount of time spent playing computer games How many kills you can make in a minute with a computer game will have zero effect on your capacity to be a good missionary Giving the Lord more of your time by studying the scriptures and gaining an understanding of the marvelous message of the Restoration that we have for the world Serving others and sharing your testimony with them Now fathers you have a vital role in this preparation process We know that the most profound influence on helping young men prepare for the Melchizedek Priesthood marriage and fatherhood is the family If your sons understand the basic doctrines required to become a faithful father they will surely be ready to serve as a full time missionary Unfortunately far too many fathers abdicate this eternal responsibility You may assume that the bishop and the seminary Sunday School and Young Men teachers and leaders are in a better position to motivate and inspire your sons than you are That simply is not the case While ecclesiastical leaders are important to your son s priesthood and missionary preparation the Church exists as a resource to you It is not a substitute for your inspired teaching guidance and correction Consequently if we are raising the bar for your sons to serve as missionaries that means we are also raising the bar for you If we expect more of them that means we expect more of you and your wife as well Remember Helaman s 2 000 stripling warriors were faithful because they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him Alma 53 21 and that instruction came in their homes Some fathers don t think they have the right to ask worthiness questions of their children They think that is the purview of the bishop alone Fathers not only do you have the right to know the worthiness of your children you have the responsibility It is your duty to know how your children are doing with regards to their spiritual well being and progression You need to monitor carefully the issues and concerns they share with you Ask specific questions of your children regarding their worthiness and refuse to settle for anything less than specific answers Too often our bishops have to instruct youth to talk to their parents about problems they are having That procedure should actually flow the other direction Parents should be so intimately aware of what is going on in their children s lives that they know about the problems before the bishop does They should be counseling with their children and going with them to their bishops if that becomes necessary for complete repentance As divinely appointed judges in Israel the bishop and the stake president determine worthiness and resolve concerns on behalf of the Church but fathers you have an eternal responsibility for the spiritual welfare of your children Please assume your rightful place as counselor adviser and priesthood leader in preparing your sons to bear the Melchizedek Priesthood and to serve as missionaries Now a word to you bishops I realize there are many young men who don t have a faithful father in their home In these cases use the resources of the Church to see that these Aaronic Priesthood holders are taught by Melchizedek Priesthood brethren who can help them to prepare for their future priesthood service Upon you bishops and you stake presidents rests the responsibility to recommend only those young men and women whom you judge to be spiritually physically mentally and emotionally prepared to face today s realities of missionary work Brethren judge wisely and remember not every young man needs to be called to serve away from his home some may best serve under your direction as ward missionaries To those of you who are currently serving as full time missionaries we thank you for your service Tonight is a good time for each of you to take a close look at your performance and if you are not measuring up your mission president will help you make the necessary changes to be an effective dedicated servant of the Lord Jesus Christ Finally to those of you who have already served please remember that you were released from your missions but not from the Church You spent two years as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ We expect you to always look and act like one of His disciples Look the part Act the part Don t follow worldly trends and fashions You are better than that If you have slipped then do what is necessary to regain your spiritual balance The rules for happiness and success after your mission are pretty much the same as they were during your mission pray hard work hard and be obedient Get busy now and find your eternal companion to enjoy life with Serve the Lord together and raise up the next great generation My brethren I have spoken plainly tonight I hope you can feel the love and the concern that emanates from the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and other Church leaders as we ask you to prepare now to join us in taking the blessings of the restored gospel to all the people on the earth Each one of you is precious and we want you to be successful and secure in the battle for the souls of our Heavenly Father s children May God bless you with the courage to be true at all times Alma 53 20 and with the vision to realize who you are and what the Lord has for you to do I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters may I on behalf of all of us express appreciation also to the Relief Society presidency and their board who have served us so well and are just recently released Once again we are approaching the close of another uplifting and inspiring general conference I always feel so energized and enlightened during these marvelous days of teaching and testimony I know that most of you feel the same way Perhaps what we feel during conference is similar to the feeling experienced by the Savior s earliest disciples as they followed Him from place to place to hear Him teach the good news of His gospel In many ways those were disheartening days for the children of Israel Toiling under the domination of the Roman Empire they yearned for freedom and peace They awaited the Messiah they were sure He would come to deliver them from physical and political oppression And some responded to the Savior s gospel of happiness and peace although they did not yet fully appreciate all of its spiritual implications On one particular day early in the Lord s mortal ministry a great multitude followed Him to the Sea of Galilee and pressed around Him as He stood on the shore So he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land And he taught them many things by parables Mark 4 1 2 Great and wonderful things were taught that day including the parable of the sower see Mark 4 3 20 At the end of a full day of teaching and instruction the Lord suggested to His disciples that they cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee While they were sailing that night there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full And he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him Master carest thou not that we perish And he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea Peace be still And the wind ceased and there was a great calm Mark 4 37 39 Can you imagine what the Apostles must have been thinking as they watched the very elements the wind the rain and the sea obey their Master s calm command Although they had only recently been called to the holy apostleship they knew Him and they loved Him and believed in Him They had left their work and their families to follow Him In a relatively short period of time they had heard Him teach incredible things and they had seen Him perform mighty miracles But this was beyond their comprehension and the looks on their faces must have shown it And he said unto them Why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith And they feared exceedingly and said one to another What manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him Mark 4 40 41 In turbulent and sometimes frightening times the Savior s promise of infinite and eternal peace resonates with special power to us just as His ability to calm the crashing waves must have profoundly affected those who were with Him on the Sea of Galilee that stormy night so long ago Like those who were alive at the time of His mortal ministry there are some among us who look for physical peace and prosperity as signs of the Savior s wondrous power We sometimes fail to understand that the everlasting peace Jesus promises is an inner peace born in faith anchored by testimony nurtured with love and expressed through continual obedience and repentance It is a peace of spirit that echoes through the heart and the soul If one truly knows and experiences this inner peace there is no fear from worldly disharmony or discord One knows deep down inside that all is well as far as the things that really matter are concerned As President Hinckley instructed the brethren last night there is no peace in sin There may be ease popularity fame and even prosperity but there is no peace Wickedness never was happiness Alma 41 10 One cannot be at peace if one is living a life out of harmony with revealed truth There is no peace in being mean spirited or contentious There is no peace in vulgarity promiscuity or permissiveness There is no peace in addiction to drugs alcohol or pornography There is no peace in being abusive to others in any way whether it be emotionally physically or sexually for those who are abusive will remain in mental and spiritual turmoil until they come to Christ in all humility and seek forgiveness through complete repentance At one time or another I believe everyone yearns for the peace of God which passeth all understanding Philip 4 7 That peace for our troubled hearts only comes to us as we follow the Light of Christ which is given to every man that he may know good from evil Moro 7 16 as it leads us to repent of sins and seek forgiveness For all there is a hunger to know the peaceable things of the kingdom D C 36 2 and to taste the fruit s of righteousness which are sown in peace of them that make peace James 3 18 In every home neighborhood and community we ought to strive for peace and never be party to stirring up contention or division Throughout scriptural history the Lord has promised peace to His followers The Psalmist wrote The Lord will give strength unto his people the Lord will bless his people with peace Ps 29 11 Isaiah referred to the Savior as The Prince of Peace Isa 9 6 And Nephi foresaw the day among his descendants when the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them and he shall heal them and they shall have peace with him 2 Ne 26 9 Just hours before He was to begin that glorious yet awful process of the Atonement the Lord Jesus Christ made this significant promise to His Apostles Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you John 14 27 Was He promising His beloved associates the kind of peace the world recognizes safety security with the absence of contention or tribulation Certainly the historical record would suggest otherwise Those original Apostles knew much of trial and persecution throughout the remainder of their lives which is probably why the Lord added this insight to His promise Not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid John 14 27 These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace He continued In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world John 16 33 emphasis added Peace real peace whole souled to the very core of your being comes only in and through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ When that precious truth is discovered and gospel principles are understood and applied great peace can distill in the hearts and souls of our Heavenly Father s children Said the Savior through Joseph Smith He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come D C 59 23 It is sometimes amazing to see the difference this peace can have in the lives of those who accept it While I was presiding over the Canada Toronto Mission many years ago our missionaries began teaching a family that was in spiritual darkness They were poor uneducated and their personal appearance reflected a lack of appreciation or concern for normal hygiene and grooming But they were good honorable people among the honest in heart that we always pray for our missionaries to find and they responded spiritually as they felt for the first time in their lives the peace the gospel offers When we learned that they were going to be baptized Sister Ballard and I attended the baptismal service I happened to be standing next to the bishop of the ward when the family arrived In all honesty I must tell you that they were quite a sight They looked unkempt unclean and somewhat scruffy Because he had been out of town for a period of time the bishop had not yet met the newest members of his ward so this first impression was to say the least unimpressive As they walked away I thought I could feel his knees begin to buckle I put my arm around this good bishop to give him my support physically as well as spiritually I felt prompted to say to him Bishop isn t this wonderful We will make good Latter day Saints out of them He looked at me and he smiled I just couldn t tell if he was smiling because he agreed with me or if he thought that I might be just another overenthusiastic missionary The baptismal service proceeded and the family was baptized The next day we decided to attend that ward to make sure the family was well received when they came to their meetings as new members of the Church As the family came into the chapel for sacrament meeting I was sitting on the stand next to the bishop The father was wearing a clean white shirt It was not large enough for him to fasten the top button at the neck and he was wearing a tie that I could remember seeing on one of my elders But his face radiated with happiness and peace The mother and daughters looked like they had been transformed from the previous day Their dresses were not fancy but they were clean and lovely They too had that special gospel glow The little boys wore white shirts that were several sizes too large for them even with the sleeves rolled up And they were wearing ties that almost extended down to their knees It was obvious that the missionaries had put their own white shirts and ties on these little boys so they could come to sacrament meeting appropriately dressed They sat with their missionaries and the light of the gospel literally shone from them Alma describes this as receiving God s image in your countenances Alma 5 14 I leaned over to the bishop again and said See Bishop We will make Saints out of them Of course that overnight physical transformation was merely superficial when compared to the overwhelming more significant spiritual transformation that took place in that family as the gospel entered their hearts and lives Through the instruction of the missionaries and the subsequent fellowshipping of their good bishop and the ward members this entire family emerged from spiritual darkness into gospel light and truth In that light the family was warmed refreshed and revitalized by the peace that comes from knowing the Lord Jesus Christ lives The light of the gospel truths restored to earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith began to show this family the way to the temple where one year later they received their eternal blessings Again quoting the prophecies of Isaiah And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the peace of thy children Isa 54 13 Once we have tasted the sweet fruit of God s peace we are naturally inclined to share it with others Francis of Assisi was known as the lover of creation who lived most of his life ministering to the poor and the needy who were around him including the animals The peace he found in his service energized him and made him yearn to embrace others with it He wrote Lord make me an instrument of thy peace Where there is hatred let me sow love Where there is injury pardon Where there is doubt faith Where there is despair hope Where there is darkness light And where there is sadness joy O Divine Master grant that I may not so much seekTo be consoled as to console To be understood as to understand To be loved as to love For it is in giving that we receive It is in pardoning that we are pardoned And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life On more than one occasion the Lord urged His followers to be peacemakers promising that such would be called the children of God Matt 5 9 That concept is woven throughout the scriptures creating a patchwork of peace through parable and proclamation Agree with thine adversary Matt 5 25 Love your enemies Matt 5 44 Judge not Matt 7 1 Love thy neighbour as thyself Matt 22 39 Condemn not Luke 6 37 Forgive Luke 6 37 Love one another John 13 34 Those are but a few of the scriptural instructions clearly indicating that God s peace is not to be hoarded Rather it is to be shared liberally with our families our friends and our communities It is to be shared with the Church as well as those who are not members of our Church While those around us may not choose to taste the sweetness and peace of the fulness of the restored gospel for themselves surely they will be blessed by seeing it in our lives and feeling the peace of the gospel in our presence The message of peace will grow and expand through our example Live in peace said the Apostle Paul and the God of love and peace shall be with you 2 Cor 13 11 I am grateful that I can witness to you that Jesus is the Christ and He is the Son of God By following Him in faith and trust all may find the sweet inner peace the gospel offers to us as it has been taught to us so beautifully during this conference To this I humbly testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
It may very well have been a beautiful crisp autumn day like this The Savior was sitting teaching some of His disciples when a man identified only as a certain lawyer stood and asked Him Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life Jesus knew the man s heart and understood the question was a thinly veiled attempt to get Him to say something contrary to the law of Moses The Savior responded to the question with two questions of His own What is written in the law how readest thou As you might expect the lawyer was able to recite the law Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself Thou hast answered right the Savior said This do and thou shalt live But the lawyer wasn t satisfied with that Knowing that there were strict rules and beliefs among the Jews regarding association with those not of the faith he pressed the Lord for more information hoping to trap Him in controversy And who is my neighbour he asked It was time once again to teach Jesus drew upon one of His favorite and most effective teaching techniques a parable perhaps one of the most beloved and well known parables in all of Christendom You know the parable how a man from Jerusalem was on his way to Jericho and fell among thieves and was left half dead A certain priest passed by on the other side neither did a Levite stop to help Then Jesus taught But a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him And went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him Then Jesus asked the lawyer one more question Which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among thieves And the lawyer replied He that shewed mercy on him Then Jesus delivered His final instruction to the lawyer and to all who have read the parable of the good Samaritan Go and do thou likewise see Luke 10 25 37 Every time I read this parable I am impressed with its power and its simplicity But have you ever wondered why the Savior chose to make the hero of this story a Samaritan There was considerable antipathy between the Jews and the Samaritans at the time of Christ Under normal circumstances these two groups avoided association with each other It would still be a good instructive parable if the man who fell among thieves had been rescued by a brother Jew His deliberate use of Jews and Samaritans clearly teaches that we are all neighbors and that we should love esteem respect and serve one another despite our deepest differences including religious political and cultural differences That instruction continues today to be part of the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints In enumerating the key doctrines of the restored Church Joseph Smith said while we claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience we also allow all men the same privilege let them worship how where or what they may A of F 1 11 Thankfully many of our members understand this doctrine and live it during the course of their daily lives I recently read a news account of a tragic death in a community here in Utah A grieving young widow was quoted We ve been overwhelmed by support We re not Mormon but the local ward here has been all over us with meals and help and words of comfort It s been a total outpouring of love and we appreciate it quoted in Dick Harmon Former Ute s Death Leaves Wife Coping Wondering Daily Herald Provo Utah 11 Aug 2001 A3 That s just as it should be If we are truly disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ we will reach out with love and understanding to all of our neighbors at all times particularly in times of need A recent Church News carried a story of two women who are dear friends a Jewish physician from New York and a stay at home Latter day Saint mom of six from Utah both a long way from home in Dallas Texas Our member reported If our friendship had been put through a computer matching service I doubt we would have made it past the first hurdle A woman with a busy medical practice I assumed would have little desire to discuss the color of the hospitality napkins for PTA Funny thing about assumptions they can cut away the very roots of something that could flourish and grow if given a chance I am forever grateful that assumptions were cast aside Shauna Erickson Unlikely Friends Sharing a Lifetime Church News 18 Aug 2001 10 Perceptions and assumptions can be very dangerous and unfair There are some of our members who may fail to reach out with friendly smiles warm handshakes and loving service to all of their neighbors At the same time there may be those who move into our neighborhoods who are not of our faith who come with negative preconceptions about the Church and its members Surely good neighbors should put forth every effort to understand each other and to be kind to one another regardless of religion nationality race or culture Occasionally I hear of members offending those of other faiths by overlooking them and leaving them out This can occur especially in communities where our members are the majority I have heard about narrow minded parents who tell children that they cannot play with a particular child in the neighborhood simply because his or her family does not belong to our Church This kind of behavior is not in keeping with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ I cannot comprehend why any member of our Church would allow these kinds of things to happen I have been a member of this Church my entire life I have been a full time missionary twice a bishop a mission president a Seventy and now an Apostle I have never taught nor have I ever heard taught a doctrine of exclusion I have never heard the members of this Church urged to be anything but loving kind tolerant and benevolent to our friends and neighbors of other faiths The Lord expects a great deal from us Parents please teach your children and practice yourselves the principle of inclusion of others and not exclusion because of religious political or cultural differences While it is true we declare to the world that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith and we urge our members to share their faith and testimonies with others it has never been the policy of the Church that those who choose not to listen or to accept our message should be shunned or ignored Indeed the opposite is true President Gordon B Hinckley has repeatedly reminded us of this special obligation that we have as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ I quote just one Each of us is an individual Each of us is different There must be respect for those differences We must work harder to build mutual respect an attitude of forbearance with tolerance one for another regardless of the doctrines and philosophies which we may espouse Concerning these you and I may disagree But we can do so with respect and civility Teachings of Gordon B Hinckley 1997 661 665 As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints we understand that we are perceived by some to be a peculiar people 1 Pet 2 9 Our doctrines and beliefs are important to us We embrace them and cherish them I am not suggesting for a moment that we shouldn t On the contrary our peculiarity and the uniqueness of the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ are indispensable elements in offering the people of the world a clear choice Neither am I suggesting that we should associate in any relationship that would place us or our families at spiritual risk We must understand however that not everyone is going to accept our doctrine of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ For the most part our neighbors not of our faith are good honorable people every bit as good and honorable as we strive to be They care about their families just like we do They want to make the world a better place just like we do They are kind and loving and generous and faithful just like we seek to be Nearly 25 years ago the First Presidency declared Our message is one of special love and concern for the eternal welfare of all men and women regardless of religious belief race or nationality knowing that we are truly brothers and sisters because we are sons and daughters of the same Eternal Father First Presidency statement 15 Feb 1978 That is our doctrine a doctrine of inclusion That is what we believe That is what we have been taught Of all people on this earth we should be the most loving the kindest and the most tolerant because of that doctrine May I suggest three simple things we can do to avoid making others in our neighborhoods feel excluded First get to know your neighbors Learn about their families their work their views Get together with them if they are willing and do so without being pushy and without any ulterior motives Friendship should never be offered as a means to an end it can and should be an end unto itself I received a letter from a woman who recently moved to Utah a small part of which I quote I must tell you Elder Ballard that when I greet my neighbors or if I wave to them they do not acknowledge my greeting If I pass them while taking my morning or evening walk my salutation is not returned Other people of color consistently express similar negative responses to friendly gestures If members of the Church are among her neighbors surely they must know that this should not happen Let us cultivate meaningful relationships of mutual trust and understanding with people from different backgrounds and beliefs Second I believe it would be good if we eliminated a couple of phrases from our vocabulary nonmember and non Mormon Such phrases can be demeaning and even belittling Personally I don t consider myself to be a non Catholic or a non Jew I am a Christian I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints That is how I prefer to be identified for who and what I am as opposed to being identified for what I am not Let us extend that same courtesy to those who live among us If a collective description is needed then neighbors seems to work well in most cases And third if neighbors become testy or frustrated because of some disagreement with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints or with some law we support for moral reasons please don t suggest to them even in a humorous way that they consider moving someplace else I cannot comprehend how any member of our Church can even think such a thing Our pioneer ancestors were driven from place to place by uninformed and intolerant neighbors They experienced extraordinary hardship and persecution because they thought acted and believed differently from others If our history teaches us nothing else it should teach us to respect the rights of all people to peacefully coexist with one another I now speak to all those who are not of our faith If there are issues of concern let us talk about them We want to be helpful Please understand however that our doctrines and teachings are set by the Lord so sometimes we will have to agree to disagree with you but we can do so without being disagreeable In our communities we can and must work together in an atmosphere of courtesy respect and civility Here in Utah a group of concerned citizens formed the Alliance for Unity This effort has been endorsed by our Church as well as other churches and organizations One of its purposes is to seek to build a community where differing viewpoints are acknowledged and valued Perhaps there has never been a more important time for neighbors all around the world to stand together for the common good of one another Just hours before He began the painful physical and spiritual processes of the Atonement the Savior met with His Apostles to partake of the Feast of the Passover His Last Supper and to give them the final instructions He would give them in mortality Among these teachings is the stirring life changing declaration A new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another John 13 34 35 That is what Jesus taught His disciples including a certain lawyer through the parable of the good Samaritan And that is what He is teaching us today through living prophets and apostles Love one another Be kind to one another despite our deepest differences Treat one another with respect and civility I know and testify that Jesus is the Christ our Savior and Redeemer and I know that He expects all of us to follow His admonition to be better neighbors to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters have you ever had the experience of driving around and around the streets of a city with the driver saying I know where it is I m sure I can find it Finally in frustration he stops and asks someone for directions I can tell you sisters have experienced this How much easier it is to find our way when we follow the directions of someone who knows how to locate our destination Many of us may find ourselves in a similar situation as we make our way through life s challenging thoroughfares These are difficult times and the world s cultural and sociological landmarks of propriety honesty integrity and political correctness are constantly shifting Just when we think we know the way to happiness and peace some new ideology comes along which can lead us down a path that will only heighten our confusion and intensify our despair At such times we might well ask Is there one clear unpolluted unbiased voice that we can always count on Is there a voice that will always give us clear directions to find our way in today s troubled world The answer is yes That voice is the voice of the living prophet and apostles When The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints was organized 171 years ago this month the Lord gave a revelation to the members of the Church through His prophet Joseph Smith Jr Speaking of the President of the Church the Savior instructed Church members to give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them walking in all holiness before me For his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith D C 21 4 5 Then the Lord gave a magnificent promise to those who are obedient For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you yea and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you and cause the heavens to shake for your good and his name s glory D C 21 6 A year and a half later the Lord added to that significant promise this stern warning The arm of the Lord shall be revealed and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord neither the voice of his servants neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles shall be cut off from among the people D C 1 14 What I the Lord have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not myself and though the heavens and the earth pass away my word shall not pass away but shall all be fulfilled whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same D C 1 38 It is no small thing my brothers and sisters to have a prophet of God in our midst Great and wonderful are the blessings that come into our lives as we listen to the word of the Lord given to us through him At the same time knowing that President Gordon B Hinckley is God s prophet also endows us with responsibility When we hear the counsel of the Lord expressed through the words of the President of the Church our response should be positive and prompt History has shown that there is safety peace prosperity and happiness in responding to prophetic counsel as did Nephi of old I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded 1 Ne 3 7 We know of the experience of Naaman who was struck with leprosy and who eventually contacted the prophet Elisha and was instructed to go and wash in the Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean 2 Kgs 5 10 At first Naaman was unwilling to follow Elisha s counsel He couldn t understand the thing he had been asked to do to wash seven times in the Jordan river In other words his pride and stubbornness were keeping him from receiving the Lord s blessing through His prophet Thankfully he finally went down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean 2 Kgs 5 14 What a humbling thing it must have been for Naaman to realize how close he came to allowing his own pride and his unwillingness to listen to the counsel of the prophet to prevent him from receiving such a great cleansing blessing And what a humbling thing it is to contemplate how many of us might miss out on great and promised blessings because we do not listen and then do the relatively simple things our prophet is telling us to do today In the last year for example President Hinckley has delivered three landmark addresses about strengthening the family and particularly the youth and young adults of the Church First he spoke very directly on the subject to mothers during the October general Relief Society meeting Then he spoke to fathers and priesthood leaders during priesthood session of general conference Remember fathers He reminded you parents that you have entered into a partnership with our Father in Heaven to give mortal experience to His sons and daughters They are His children and they are your children flesh of your flesh for whom He will hold you responsible Your Greatest Challenge Mother Ensign Nov 2000 97 And then last November from this very pulpit President Hinckley spoke to all of the young people of the Church In heartfelt teaching that will long be remembered he challenged the youth of the Church to set goals for themselves to be grateful be smart be clean be true be humble and be prayerful The six B s as President Hinckley called them are a marvelous standard for all Latter day Saints He repeated these principles to the young women in their meeting last week and I believe they apply to mothers and fathers as much as they do to youth and young single adults As parents and adult leaders of youth we cannot expect our young people to take to heart the things the prophet says to them if we show a complacent attitude toward his counsel in our own lives It is significant to remember that President Hinckley petitioned the Lord on behalf of our young people He said I want you to know that I have been on my knees asking the Lord to bless me with the power and the capacity and the language to reach into your hearts A Prophet s Counsel and Prayer for Youth Ensign Jan 2001 2 During the priesthood session President Hinckley said I hope your sons and daughters can share their burden with you their fathers and mothers I hope that you will listen that you will be patient and understanding that you will draw them to you and comfort and sustain them in their loneliness Pray for direction Pray for patience Pray for the strength to love even though the offenses may have been serious Pray for understanding and kindness and above all for wisdom and inspiration Great Shall Be the Peace of Thy Children Ensign Nov 2000 51 Have we studied his counsel and identified the things we need to avoid or to do differently I know a 17 year old who just prior to the prophet s talk had pierced her ears a second time She came home from the fireside took off the second set of earrings and simply said to her parents If President Hinckley says we should only wear one set of earrings that s good enough for me Wearing two pair of earrings may or may not have eternal consequences for this young woman but her willingness to obey the prophet will And if she will obey him now on something relatively simple how much easier it will be to follow him when greater issues are at stake Are we listening brothers and sisters Are we hearing the words of the prophet to us as parents as youth leaders and as youth Or are we allowing ourselves as Naaman did at first to be blinded by pride and stubbornness which could prevent us from receiving the blessings that come from following the teachings of God s prophet Today I make you a promise It s a simple one but it is true If you will listen to the living prophet and the apostles and heed our counsel you will not go astray Now my brothers and sisters and youth of the Church please do not miss the opportunity to sit down together as a family and discuss the counsel given by President Hinckley Parents teach each other and your children in family home evenings and family councils Leaders know and teach these principles in lessons and leadership meetings and discuss in ward and stake council meetings how to bless the lives of our members both young and old All three of the President s addresses along with messages to the youth from his counselors have been published in the Ensign and the Liahona magazines President Gordon B Hinckley Speaks to Youth and Parents is now available on video and is a wonderful resource for family home evening and for bishop s youth discussions Bishops we did not send this to you to sit on your filing cabinet Please see that the youth of your ward listen again and understand and commit to live as directed by the President of the Church Now I speak directly to the young people of the Church on this important subject of following the prophet As I have traveled throughout the Church these past few months I have noticed that many of you are eagerly following his counsel Many of you have already made the decision to be even more well groomed than you were before Many of you are striving more diligently to avoid evil talk to choose your friends wisely to stay away from pornography and illicit drugs to not attend evil concerts and dangerous parties to respect your bodies and keep yourselves morally clean in every way To those of you who have not listened yet I caution you to not disregard the counsel of the President of the Church He has spoken to you plainly Study his words and strive to obey them They are true and come from God We encourage you who need to repent to go forward with faith and become clean before the Lord Each one of you is preparing now to be a leader in the Church in the future and we need you to be clean and faithful and true to the Lord Never forget how it felt to listen as President Hinckley prayed for you Did you feel how precious you are as he prayed Bless them that they may walk acceptably before Thee as Thy cherished sons and daughters Each is Thy child with the capacity to do great and noble things Ensign Jan 2001 11 Now my dear brothers and sisters please pay attention to those things that the leaders of the Church have taught during this general conference Apply the teachings that will help you and your family Let all of us regardless of our family circumstances bring into our homes the teachings of the prophets and the apostles to strengthen our relationships with each other and with our Father in Heaven and with the Lord Jesus Christ I promise you in the name of the Lord that if you will listen not just with your ears but also with your heart the Holy Ghost will manifest the truth unto you of the messages delivered by President Hinckley his counselors the Apostles and other leaders of the Church The Spirit will prompt you to know what you should do as individuals and as families in order to follow our counsel that your testimonies might be strengthened and that you might have peace and joy My brothers and sisters I testify to you that the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith Today we are blessed to be led by God s prophet President Gordon B Hinckley May we listen and then do those things that he teaches us is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In March of 1839 from the bleak dungeon that was Liberty Jail the Prophet Joseph Smith counseled the Church There are many yet on the earth among all sects parties and denominations who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it D C 123 12 Years later at the age of 15 the Prophet s nephew Joseph F Smith was called to serve a mission in Hawaii You will remember that he was only five when his father Hyrum was martyred His mother Mary Fielding died when he was just 13 Upon arriving on the island of Maui young Joseph fell gravely ill Despite these and other adversities he wrote to Elder George A Smith I am ready to bear my testimony at any time or at any place or in whatsoever circumstances I may be placed I am ready to go through thick and thin for this cause in which I am engaged as quoted in Joseph Fielding Smith comp Life of Joseph F Smith 1938 176 Today we must ask ourselves Are we ready and willing to go through thick and thin for the cause in which we are engaged Do we reflect in our countenances the joy of living the gospel of Christ as true disciples should If we do not understand and willingly teach others of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith who will We cannot place the burden of taking the gospel to all people solely on the backs of the full time missionaries Families will not be fortified nor will individual testimonies be strengthened convert baptisms will not be increased neither will the less active be welcomed back until we as members of the Church arise individually and collectively with dedication and action to help build the kingdom of God Our duty lies in assisting others through the power of the Spirit to know and understand the doctrines and principles of the gospel Everyone must come to feel that the doctrines of the Restoration are true and of great value And everyone who accepts the message must strive to live the gospel by making and keeping sacred covenants and by participating in all of the ordinances of salvation and exaltation We often think of conversion as applying only to investigators but there are some members who are not yet fully converted and who have yet to experience the mighty change of heart described in the scriptures see Alma 5 12 Brethren and sisters true and complete conversion is the key to accelerating the work of the Church We know that both members and nonmembers are more likely to be thoroughly converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ when there is a willingness to experiment upon the word see Alma 32 27 This is an attitude of both mind and heart that includes a desire to know the truth and a willingness to act on that desire For those investigating the Church the experiment can be as simple as agreeing to read the Book of Mormon to pray about it and to earnestly seek to know if Joseph Smith was the Lord s prophet True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit When the Spirit touches the heart hearts are changed When individuals both members and investigators feel the Spirit working with them or when they see the evidence of the Lord s love and mercy in their lives they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word This is how we come to feel the gospel is true A most significant evidence of our conversion and of how we feel about the gospel in our own lives is our willingness to share it with others and to help missionaries find someone to teach The likelihood of lasting conversion greatly increases when a nonmember has a friend or a relative who radiates the joy of being a member of the Church The influence of members of the Church is very powerful I believe that s why President Hinckley asked us to see that everyone has a friend see Converts and Young Men Ensign May 1997 47 Here then is an important key to our success in accelerating the Lord s work As active members of the Church and especially as priesthood and auxiliary leaders we need to do more to assist in the process of conversion retention and activation We know that faithful members desire to serve but sometimes we lose sight of the essential outcomes that our faith and works ought to produce in strengthening the commitment of our Father s children to the gospel Bishops you are the key You give the vision and invite your ward council to help you strengthen the spiritual conversion of those investigating the Church as well as all of your members Encourage council members to constantly think about the specific things they can do to assist you in helping your ward members and their nonmember friends to better know and understand the gospel What can they do to help them feel it is true and to support them as they strive to live the principles Ask yourselves what specific things we as priesthood and auxiliary leaders can do to encourage a family or an individual to experiment on the good word of God What can the council do as leaders and teachers to ensure that every person who attends our Church meetings feels the Spirit and is strengthened spiritually We are just now learning to focus on the right things in our council meetings but too often we still focus only on generalities In one stake where they are having great success in baptizing and retaining new converts the full time missionaries are invited to meet with the ward council to discuss people they are teaching The council members seek inspiration in determining which leaders and ward members can best help the missionaries fellowship specific individuals and families and bring them into the Church Some of you bishops feel like you must be involved in every action your council members take This is a mistake because if you do you will never bring all the powerful resources God has given to you into full strength At the general Relief Society meeting two weeks ago Sister Sheri Dew said she believes the sisters are the Lord s secret weapon I think she is right Our sister leaders have a spiritual sensitivity that will prompt them how to best approach and nurture those whom the missionaries are teaching The best place to begin to fully utilize the talents and wisdom of our sisters is through the established council system of the Church You are free to be flexible in how you use the ward council Just last year President Hinckley said this to the bishops of the Church You are not bound by rigid rules You have unlimited flexibility You are entitled to answers to your prayers to inspiration and revelation from the Lord Find the Lambs Feed the Sheep Ensign May 1999 110 Perhaps in some cases holding council meetings only once a month will not be sufficient to focus on the spiritual conversion of members and nonmembers alike who are under your ministering care You are free to meet in council as often as deemed necessary Recently a stake president shared with me a tender story demonstrating the power of the council system in building up the Church He said that both the Relief Society and the priesthood had been working with a family in their stake but had failed to make progress with the parents Primary leaders found the answer Permission was given by the parents for their young daughter to attend Primary Their one condition was that she had to want to go badly enough to get there on her own Rides to church could not be provided Because she had to go through a rough part of town the ward council saw to it that someone would drive along beside her as she rode an old bicycle to church Through summer heat through rain and even snow she persisted in going to church One young man who with his family was assigned to escort her on a snowy morning was so touched as he watched the commitment of this little girl pedaling through the snow and cold that he decided to serve a full time mission citing this experience as the turning point in his life At Christmastime a family in the ward gave this faithful little girl a new 10 speed bicycle This so touched the parents that they too began attending church In May 1999 this young girl was baptized What made the baptism even more special was that it was performed by the newest priest in the ward her recently activated father Bishops for you to accomplish what the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve are asking your ward council needs to capture this vision and work more closely together in doing God s great work of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of all of His children Imagine the power that would come if every member of the Church would reach out to help all members and investigators enjoy the companionship of the Spirit Let all of us work harder to see that the presence of the Spirit is in all of our meetings to bring about deeper spiritual conversion This will especially require ward councils to assist the bishoprics in improving reverence in our sacrament meetings and in better teaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ in all of our church meetings All of us should constantly think about the Savior giving His life for us We must never forget that He suffered rejection humiliation unspeakable agony and eventually death in order to save you and me and the whole world from sin Can any one of us go before Him in some future day and say that we didn t share the gospel with others and help others come to the missionaries because we were too busy or too shy or for any other reason This is God s work He wants us to participate with Him and His Beloved Son in bringing the gospel into the lives of all of His children The Lord has promised us that our joy will be great if we bring just one soul unto Him see D C 18 15 16 Let us exercise greater faith and work together members and missionaries to bring many more souls unto Him Let every family in the Church include as part of their daily family prayers a plea with the Lord to go before your family members and help them to find someone prepared to receive the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Now is the time for members of the Church to be more bold in reaching out to others helping them to know the Church is true Now is the time to sustain by our actions what President Gordon B Hinckley is asking us to do Lucifer is unleashing vulgar revolting violent and sleazy filth with the design to destroy the spiritual sensitivity of our Father s children We truly are at war with those who mock God and shun the truth so let us keep our covenants and heed our call to service Let us marshal all of the Lord s resources including the power of our own testimonies Let them be heard by many more people Let the spirit of President Joseph F Smith be in our hearts Let us say I am ready to bear my testimony at any time or at any place or in whatsoever circumstance I may be placed It will help us to do this by reading often the Prophet Joseph Smith s own story and then sharing with others our own sure knowledge that the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored once again to the earth We must move forward with the promise that the Spirit will bless us to know what to do and what to say as we assist those who are seeking to know the truth Let us go forward with more faith never forgetting that the Lord will help us as we turn to Him in mighty prayer Our Heavenly Father lives and loves each of His children The Lord Jesus Christ lives The most important work we can do is to help God s children come to a full understanding of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ This I know to be true and so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
It is wonderful my brothers and sisters to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in this remarkable new Conference Center at the dawn of a new millennium One hundred years ago President Lorenzo Snow stood in the Tabernacle to open the 70th annual conference of the Church It was the first conference of the 1900s and it came at the end of a period of great trial and tribulation for the Church Total Church membership then was approaching 300 000 with the majority of those members living in Utah On Friday April 6 1900 President Snow said The Lord has prospered us amazingly and we are doing large things at the present time Now that we are approaching our seventy first year the Lord expects that we will do something something that will cause the nations to marvel as what we have done has caused them already to wonder And then President Snow asked this compelling question Now Latter day Saints he said how is it with us We have received the Gospel We have received the kingdom of God established on the earth We have had trouble we have been persecuted We were driven from Ohio we were driven from Missouri we were driven from Nauvoo and once we were driven for a time from this beautiful city Many have lost thousands of dollars lost their homes and all they had and some of the brethren have seen their wives and children lay down their lives because of the hardships they had to experience The people have looked with astonishment at the willingness of the Latter day Saints to suffer these things Why do we do this What is it that enables us to endure these persecutions and still rejoice President Snow gave this answer It is because we have had revelations from the Almighty because He has spoken to us in our souls and has given to us the Holy Ghost This Church will stand because it is upon a firm basis It is not from man it is not from the study of the New Testament or the Old Testament it is not the result of the learning that we received in colleges nor seminaries but it has come directly from the Lord The Lord has shown it to us by the revealing principle of the Holy Spirit of light and every man can receive this same spirit in Conference Report Apr 1900 2 3 It would be well for us my brothers and sisters to give careful consideration to that same question today How is it with us A century has passed we are now in our 171st year as a church Church membership is now approaching 11 million worldwide Our members are respected leaders in almost every field of endeavor in nearly every country The Church is growing temples are being built at an unprecedented pace Missionary work continues to move forward Church meetings are held on a regular basis in nearly every nation Yet as our prophets have indicated the Lord expects that we will do something But what What is it that needs our personal attention As I read and ponder the scriptures and carefully consider the Lord s counsel to His followers in every dispensation of time it appears to me that the most important thing every one of us can do is to examine our own commitment and devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ We must carefully guard against spiritual apathy and work to maintain the full measure of our loving loyalty to the Lord While it is true that extraordinary strides are being made throughout the Church the enormity of the task before us is overwhelming Simply stated we have a ministry to all of our Heavenly Father s children on both sides of the veil In that context we have barely scratched the surface of our calling True discipleship therefore precludes any complacency The Lord expects us to continue moving the Church forward and even to accelerate our pace toward the literal fulfillment of Daniel s prophetic vision of a stone cut out without hands that became a great mountain and filled the whole earth Dan 2 34 35 To do this more effectively each one of us needs to follow Nephi s counsel to press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men For if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life 2 Ne 31 20 The power of the Holy Ghost will fill our hearts and minds as we look to the Savior for answers to the many challenges of life Therefore my brothers and sisters it is important that we each know for ourselves that Jesus is the Christ and that He has restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith the fulness of His everlasting gospel As we press forward in His service spiritual experiences will increase our faith and we will find great joy Our understanding of the essential doctrines and eternal truths that have been restored will become a firm foundation of our faith And as we come to know and understand these true doctrines for ourselves we will discover that there is also a great need for us to share our knowledge and beliefs with others while always maintaining their friendship and goodwill While we should be pleased to testify to the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to all who will hear our message there are times when all that we can hope to accomplish is to help those who are not members of the Church better understand our basic beliefs There are many people who know a little about us who are curious and who wonder about us but who are not ready to change their lifestyle or make eternal commitments We need to be prepared to teach them in ways that they can understand and appreciate even if they are not prepared as yet to respond to spiritual promptings and to accept the gospel in their lives For example it has been my experience that when members and our missionaries are guided by the Spirit our conversations with non Latter day Saint friends and associates flow easily and naturally to the subject of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man All of us regardless of race color or creed belong to the family of our Heavenly Father Most people share this belief Our understanding and knowledge of this basic truth should compel us to love all of God s children as our brothers and sisters and to explain to them that we all lived premortally as spirit children of our Heavenly Father There we learned about and accepted His plan for us to come to earth to gain a mortal body and be tested Our deep rooted respect for all mankind is enhanced by our understanding of our relationship one to another in our premortal life This understanding then makes it possible to explain in a nonthreatening way our belief in our eternal relationship to Jesus Christ and our deep commitment to Him Our hope and faith are rooted in the profound understanding that He lives today and that He continues to lead and guide His Church and His people We rejoice in the knowledge of the living Christ and we reverently acknowledge the miracles He continues to work today in the lives of those who have faith in Him He is the head of the Church which bears His name He is our Savior and our Redeemer Through Him we worship and pray to our Heavenly Father We are grateful beyond measure for the essential and awesome power His Atonement has in each of our lives Because we love the Lord we should be spiritually sensitive to moments when the powerful and important truths of the gospel can be shared with others Perhaps more importantly however we should seek at all times to purify ourselves and to lead such worthy lives that the Light of Christ emanates from us in all that we say and do Our day to day lives should stand as immutable witness of our faith in Christ In the words of the Apostle Paul Be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity 1 Tim 4 12 Once these important principles are understood we can then explain and expand the understanding of our Father s children by sharing with them how Jesus Himself established and organized His Church in the meridian of time by giving some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers For the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ Eph 4 11 12 From there we can help our friends and neighbors understand the Apostasy or falling away from the original Church organized by the Lord which was prophesied by those who helped to establish the Church in the first place Paul wrote to the Thessalonian Christians who were eagerly anticipating the Second Coming of the Savior that that day shall not come except there come a falling away first 2 Thes 2 3 He also warned Timothy that the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but they shall turn away their ears from the truth 2 Tim 4 3 4 And Peter presupposed a falling away when he spoke of the times of refreshing that would come before God would again send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began Acts 3 19 21 Do you see how naturally and easily one principle of the Restoration leads to the next Peter s prophecy almost begs for a discussion of the restoration of the gospel in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith This in turn demands a dialogue about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the holy priesthood through the gift and power of God From there it is so natural to share the principle of continuing revelation and the organization of the Church and its doctrines and programs Brothers and sisters the Lord expects us to do something I believe we are expected to increase our own faith shake off any possible feelings of apathy and by the power of the Holy Ghost reaffirm our commitment and intensify our service to the Lord Then when we seek to clarify someone s understanding of the Church our lives well and faithfully lived can serve as a magnifying glass through which others can examine the impact of gospel living Under the light of our good example the Spirit can enlarge understanding of the Church and its mission to all with whom we have contact We need not apologize for our beliefs nor back down from that which we know to be true But we can share it in a spirit of loving understanding boldly and confidently with an eye single to the glory of God without pressuring our listeners or feeling that we have failed in our duty if they do not immediately accept what we believe When we have the companionship of the Holy Ghost we can then do simple things to help bring better understanding of the gospel into the lives of the less active members of the Church as well as those who are not of our faith There is no need for any new program to do this We don t need a handbook or a calling or a training meeting The only need is for good members of the Church to learn to rely upon the power of the Holy Ghost and with this power reach out and touch the lives of our Father s children There is no greater service we can render than sharing our personal testimonies with those who lack an understanding of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ So brothers and sisters how is it with us Are we ready to do something Can each one of us resolve today to increase our personal spiritual preparation by seeking the guidance of the Holy Ghost and then with His power as our companion bless more of our Father s children with understanding and knowledge that the Church is true I testify that the Savior lives and He will bless each one of us if we will do all that we can to move this great work of His Church forward May each one of us resolve to do something more as we begin this new millennium is my prayer which I offer humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Towards the end of the Savior s earthly ministry His disciples came to Him with several questions concerning the future Tell us what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world Jesus responded Take heed that no man deceive you For many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places All these are the beginning of sorrows Matt 24 3 8 The Apostle Paul warned of these days For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears And they shall turn away their ears from the truth 2 Tim 4 3 4 Paul also taught that the Lord gave some apostles and some prophets For the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God That we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive Eph 4 11 14 Brothers and sisters the exact time of the Second Coming is known only to the Father see Matt 24 36 There are however signs that scriptural prophecy relating to that tumultuous day is being fulfilled Jesus cautioned several times that prior to His Second Coming many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many Matt 24 11 As Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ it is our duty to be watchmen on the tower warning Church members to beware of false prophets and false teachers who lie in wait to ensnare and destroy faith and testimony Today we warn you that there are false prophets and false teachers arising and if we are not careful even those who are among the faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints will fall victim to their deception President Joseph F Smith gave wise and clear counsel that applies to us today We can accept nothing as authoritative but that which comes directly through the appointed channel the constituted organizations of the Priesthood which is the channel that God has appointed through which to make known His mind and will to the world And the moment that individuals look to any other source that moment they throw themselves open to the seductive influences of Satan and render themselves liable to become servants of the devil they lose sight of the true order through which the blessings of the Priesthood are to be enjoyed they step outside of the pale of the kingdom of God and are on dangerous ground Whenever you see a man rise up claiming to have received direct revelation from the Lord to the Church independent of the order and channel of the Priesthood you may set him down as an imposter Gospel Doctrine 5th ed 1939 41 42 When we think of false prophets and false teachers we tend to think of those who espouse an obviously false doctrine or presume to have authority to teach the true gospel of Christ according to their own interpretation We often assume that such individuals are associated with small radical groups on the fringes of society However I reiterate there are false prophets and false teachers who have or at least claim to have membership in the Church There are those who without authority claim Church endorsement to their products and practices Beware of such Yesterday members of the Church sustained the First Presidency and members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets seers and revelators with Gordon B Hinckley also being sustained as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints He and only he holds and exercises in their fulness all of the keys of God s kingdom on earth How grateful we all are to know and to sustain President Hinckley In plainness and power President Hinckley teaches the eternal plan of salvation rebukes sin calls all people to repent and accept Christ and His gospel The doctrines of eternal salvation are not unclear or uncertain but rather they are consistent with revealed truths both ancient and modern President Spencer W Kimball reminded us that the prophets constantly cry out against that which is intolerable in the sight of the Lord against pollution of mind body and our surroundings against vulgarity stealing lying pride and blasphemy against fornication adultery homosexuality and all other abuses of the sacred power to create against murder and all that is like unto it against all manner of desecration He continued That such things should be found even among the Saints to some degree is scarcely believable Sadly however we find that to be shown the way is not necessarily to walk in it The False Gods We Worship Ensign June 1976 4 Therefore let us beware of false prophets and false teachers both men and women who are self appointed declarers of the doctrines of the Church and who seek to spread their false gospel and attract followers by sponsoring symposia books and journals whose contents challenge fundamental doctrines of the Church Beware of those who speak and publish in opposition to God s true prophets and who actively proselyte others with reckless disregard for the eternal well being of those whom they seduce Like Nehor and Korihor in the Book of Mormon they rely on sophistry to deceive and entice others to their views They set themselves up for a light unto the world that they may get gain and praise of the world but they seek not the welfare of Zion 2 Ne 26 29 Of such President Joseph F Smith warned when he spoke of the proud and self vaunting ones who read by the lamps of their own conceit who interpret by rules of their own contriving who have become a law unto themselves and so pose as the sole judges of their own doings Gospel Doctrine 381 Now let me give you a few examples of the false teachings of those who read by the lamps of their own conceit who though ever learning are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth 2 Tim 3 7 False prophets and false teachers are those who declare that the Prophet Joseph Smith was a duplicitous deceiver they challenge the First Vision as an authentic experience They declare that the Book of Mormon and other canonical works are not ancient records of scripture They also attempt to redefine the nature of the Godhead and they deny that God has given and continues to give revelation today to His ordained and sustained prophets False prophets and false teachers are those who arrogantly attempt to fashion new interpretations of the scriptures to demonstrate that these sacred texts should not be read as God s words to His children but merely as the utterances of uninspired men limited by their own prejudices and cultural biases They argue therefore that the scriptures require new interpretation and that they are uniquely qualified to offer that interpretation Perhaps most damningly they deny Christ s Resurrection and Atonement arguing that no God can save us They reject the need for a Savior In short these detractors attempt to reinterpret the doctrines of the Church to fit their own preconceived views and in the process deny Christ and His messianic role False prophets and false teachers are also those who attempt to change the God given and scripturally based doctrines that protect the sanctity of marriage the divine nature of the family and the essential doctrine of personal morality They advocate a redefinition of morality to justify fornication adultery and homosexual relationships Some openly champion the legalization of so called same gender marriages To justify their rejection of God s immutable laws that protect the family these false prophets and false teachers even attack the inspired proclamation on the family issued to the world in 1995 by the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles Regardless of which particular false doctrines they teach false prophets and false teachers are an inevitable part of the last days False prophets according to the Prophet Joseph Smith always arise to oppose the true prophets Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith sel Joseph Fielding Smith 1976 365 However in the Lord s Church there is no such thing as a loyal opposition One is either for the kingdom of God and stands in defense of God s prophets and apostles or one stands opposed And as Lehi of old counseled his sons so this counsel is true for us today And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time that he may redeem the children of men from the fall And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever knowing good from evil to act for themselves and not to be acted upon save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day according to the commandments which God hath given Wherefore men are free according to the flesh and all things are given them which are expedient unto man And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life through the great Mediator of all men or to choose captivity and death according to the captivity and power of the devil for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself And now my sons I would that ye should look to the great Mediator and hearken unto his great commandments and be faithful unto his words and choose eternal life according to the will of his Holy Spirit 2 Ne 2 26 28 Brothers and sisters let us be anxiously engaged in good causes Let us love the Father and His Son Jesus Christ Let us sustain and live by the revelations of the restored gospel Let us love our fellow beings and fill our hearts and souls with the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ Then we will sing with Isaiah Behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid Therefore with joy shall I draw water out of the wells of salvation Isa 12 2 3 We also know from Paul s inspired words to the Galatian Saints that the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith Meekness temperance against such there is no law If we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit Gal 5 22 23 25 As members of the Church each of us needs to model what it truly means to be a believing and behaving Latter day Saint Our example will have a powerful effect on others making the restored gospel become much more relevant meaningful convincing and desirable to them Let us each one radiate to others the joy confidence love and warmth of being part of the true Church of Christ Our discipleship is not something to be endured with long face and heavy heart Nor is it something to be jealously clutched to our bosoms and not shared with others As we come to understand the love of the Father and the Son for us our spirits will soar and we will come to Zion singing with songs of everlasting joy D C 45 71 Let us reach out in friendship and love to our neighbors including those of other faiths thus helping to build better family to family relationships and greater harmony in our neighborhoods Remember too often our behavior is a bigger deterrent to others than is our doctrine In the spirit of love for all men women and children help them to understand and to feel accepted and appreciated Let us remember that it is our duty to be faithful to the restored truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ It takes faith real faith total and unreserved to accept and strive to live prophetic counsel Lucifer the adversary of truth does not want us to feel or exhibit that kind of faith He encourages disobedience planting defiance in the hearts of the unwary If he is successful they will turn away from the light into the darkness of the world Our safety our peace lies in working as hard as we can to live as the Father and Son would have us live in fleeing from false prophets and false teachers and in being anxiously engaged in good causes I know that God lives Jesus is the Christ The restored gospel is true and there is great joy in being anxiously engaged in this true and holy work Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters this has been an inspirational two days and I hope that my remarks will also add to the instruction and the spirit of this general conference Occasionally I have the privilege of officiating in the temple when two worthy young people are married and sealed in the house of the Lord These are always special times for family and friends The feeling at such times is a sweet and satisfying mix of earthly happiness and eternal joy seen in the tear filled eyes of mothers who have prayed for this day with all of their hearts You see it in the eyes of fathers who for the first time in months are thinking about something besides how to pay for all of the expenses But mostly you see it in the eyes of a virtuous bride and groom who have lived true to the teachings of the gospel shunning the temptations of the world There is a special undeniable feeling available to those who have remained clean and pure and chaste Too many of our young men and women are succumbing to the pressures imposed by a world saturated with evil messages and immoral behavior Lucifer is waging a vicious war for the souls of young and old alike and the casualty count is climbing The standards of the world have shifted like the sands of a windblown desert That which was once unheard of or unacceptable is now commonplace The world s perspective has been so dramatically altered that those who choose to adhere to traditional standards of morality are viewed as strange almost as though they must justify their desire to keep the commandments of God But one thing is certain the commandments have not changed Let there be no mistake about that Right is still right Wrong is still wrong no matter how cleverly cloaked in respectability or political correctness We believe in chastity before marriage and fidelity ever after That standard is an absolute standard of truth It is neither subject to public opinion polls nor dependent upon situation or circumstance There is no need to debate it or other gospel standards But there is a desperate need for parents leaders and teachers to help our youth learn to understand love value and live the standards of the gospel Parents and youth must stand together in defense against a clever and devious adversary We must be just as dedicated effective and determined in our efforts to live the gospel as he is in his efforts to destroy it and us The challenge before us is great At risk are the immortal souls of those we love May I suggest four ways we can build a fortress of faith in our homes and particularly help prepare our youth to be clean and chaste and pure completely worthy to enter the temple The first is gospel information The most important life changing information that I know of is the knowledge that we are truly children of God our Eternal Father This is not only doctrinally correct it is spiritually vital Said the Savior in His powerful intercessory prayer And this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent John 17 3 To know Heavenly Father and to understand our relationship to Him as our Father and our God is to find meaning in this life and hope in the life to come Our families need to know He is real that we are in fact His sons and His daughters and heirs to all that He has now and forever Secure in that knowledge family members will be less likely to look for devilish diversions and more likely to look to God and live see Num 21 8 Somehow we need to instill in our hearts the powerful testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ like unto that of our pioneer forefathers Remember when Nauvoo fell in September of 1846 and the unbearable conditions of the Saints in the poor camps When word reached Winter Quarters Brigham Young immediately called the brethren together After explaining the situation and reminding them of the covenant made in the Nauvoo Temple that no one who wanted to come no matter how poor would be left behind he gave them this remarkable challenge Now is the time for labor he said Let the fire of the covenant which you made in the House of the Lord burn in your hearts like flame unquenchable Journal History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 28 Sept 1846 5 emphasis added Within a few days in spite of near destitute conditions at Winter Quarters many wagons were rolling eastward to rescue the Saints in the poor camps along the Mississippi River We often hear of the suffering and the sacrifice those early Saints endured and we ask ourselves How did they do it What was it that gave them such strength Part of the answer lies in President Young s powerful words Those early Latter day Saints had made covenants with God and those covenants burned like unquenchable fire in their hearts Sometimes we are tempted to let our lives be governed more by convenience than by covenant It is not always convenient to live gospel standards and stand up for truth and testify of the Restoration It usually is not convenient to share the gospel with others It isn t always convenient to respond to a calling in the Church especially one that stretches our abilities Opportunities to serve others in meaningful ways as we have covenanted to do rarely come at convenient times But there is no spiritual power in living by convenience The power comes as we keep our covenants As we look at the lives of these early Saints we see that their covenants were the primary force in their lives Their example and testimony were powerful enough to influence generation after generation of their children As our children grow they need information taught by parents more directly and plainly about what is and is not appropriate Parents need to teach children to avoid any pornographic photographs or stories Children and youth need to know from parents that pornography of any kind is a tool of the devil and if anyone flirts with it it has the power to addict dull and even destroy the human spirit They need to be taught not to use vulgar language and never to use the Lord s name in vain Crude jokes overheard should never be repeated Teach family members not to listen to music that celebrates the sensual Talk to them plainly about sex and the teaching of the gospel regarding chastity Let this information come from parents in the home in an appropriate way All family members need to know the rules and be fortified spiritually so they can keep them And when mistakes are made the wondrous Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ must be understood and accepted so that through the complete and sometimes difficult process of repentance forgiveness and continued hope for the future can be obtained We must never give up our individual and family quest for eternal life Unfortunately far too many parents in today s world have abdicated the responsibility to teach these values and other Church doctrines to their families believing that others will do it the peer group the school Church leaders and teachers or even the media Every day our children are learning filling their minds and hearts with experiences and perceptions that deeply influence personal value systems Brothers and sisters we need to instruct one another and instill deeper faith in our hearts to fortify ourselves with the courage to keep the commandments in a world of ever increasing wickedness We need to become so deeply converted to the gospel of Christ that the fire of the covenant will burn in our hearts like flame unquenchable And with that kind of faith we will do what is necessary to remain true and worthy Second is communication Nothing is more important to the relationship between family members than open honest communication This is particularly true for parents trying to teach gospel principles and standards to their children The ability to counsel with our youth and perhaps more importantly to really listen to their concerns is the foundation upon which successful relationships are built Often what we see in the eyes and what we feel in the heart will communicate far more than what we hear or say A word to you children Never be disrespectful to your parents You must also learn to listen especially to the counsel of your mom and dad and to the promptings of the Spirit We need to watch for and capture the special teaching moments that constantly occur within our family relationships and we need to resolve now to hold family home evening every Monday night There are powerful moments of communication through regular family prayer and through family scripture study The scriptures will help define family values and goals and talking together about them will assist family members to learn to become individually secure spiritually strong and self reliant This requires time and so we need to counsel together about how much television how many movies videos video games time on the Internet or out of the home activities should be allowed Third is intervention It is the parents duty to intervene when they see wrong choices being made That doesn t mean parents take from children the precious gift of agency Because agency is a God given gift ultimately the choice of what they will do how they will behave and what they will believe will always be theirs But as parents we need to make sure they understand appropriate behavior and the consequences to them if they pursue their wrongful course Remember there is no such thing as unlawful censorship in the home Movies magazines television videos the Internet and other media are there as guests and should only be welcomed when they are appropriate for family enjoyment Make your home a haven of peace and righteousness Don t allow evil influences to contaminate your own special spiritual environment Be kind thoughtful gentle and considerate in what you say and how you treat each other Then family goals based on gospel standards will make it easier to make good decisions The same principle applies to you bishops teachers and other leaders in the Church as you work to assist families You don t have to stand idly by as those over whom you have stewardship make poor moral choices When one of our youth stands at a moral crossroad in life almost always there is someone a parent a leader a teacher who could make a difference by intervening with love and kindness Fourth is example Just as it is difficult for a weary sailor to find his way across uncharted seas without the aid of a compass it is almost impossible for children and youth to find their way through the seas of life without the guiding light of a good example We cannot expect them to avoid those things that are inappropriate if they see their parents compromising principles and failing to live the gospel As parents teachers and leaders it is our solemn duty to set a powerful personal example of righteous strength courage sacrifice unselfish service and self control These are the traits that will help our youth hold on to the iron rod of the gospel and remain on the straight and narrow path I wish I could tell you that focusing on information communication intervention and example would always result in a perfect family with perfect children who never stray from gospel standards That is unfortunately not the case But families that know teach and live gospel principles and standards are more likely to spare themselves the pain of serious mistakes When long established patterns of positive communication and faithful example prevail it is much easier to counsel together about personal problems and to work through the necessary changes that will bless every family member Listen to King Benjamin s significant counsel I cannot tell you all the things whereby you may commit sin for there are divers ways and means even so many that I cannot number them But this much I can tell you that if you do not watch yourselves and your thoughts and your words and your deeds and observe the commandments of God and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord even unto the end of your lives ye must perish And now O man remember and perish not Mosiah 4 29 30 My brothers and sisters may God bless every one of us that the fire of our covenants may burn in our hearts like a flame unquenchable May we be prepared spiritually to renew our sacred covenants each week as we partake of the sacrament That we will honor the Lord and we will be anxious to do our part in these most exciting and great days to build up His Church by strengthening our families is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
At our last general conference President Gordon B Hinckley made the historic announcement that 30 or more smaller temples will be constructed throughout the world The first of those smaller temples was dedicated this summer in Monticello Utah As you know President Hinckley s stated goal is to have at least 100 temples in operation by the end of this century Knowing the President as I do I am sure that goal will be met if not exceeded President Hinckley has referred to this extraordinary temple building effort as a tremendous undertaking Nothing even approaching it has ever been tried before 1 Ever since this stunning announcement I have thought what great confidence the Lord and His prophet have in you and me How much responsibility now rests upon all of us to prepare ourselves and others to be worthy of the blessings of these holy temples The Brethren have long been aware that many of our members live in areas of the world quite distant from the closest temple Their hearts are true they have great faith concerning the mission of the Church and they love the Lord and want to do His will What a blessing these beautiful temples will be to these dedicated Saints Again quoting President Hinckley If temple ordinances are an essential part of the restored gospel and I testify that they are then we must provide the means by which they can be accomplished The temple ordinances become the crowning blessings the Church has to offer 2There is an urgency in this work that motivates us to extend the blessings of the temple to as many of our Heavenly Father s children as possible I was impressed with an experience of President Wilford Woodruff when he told of a visitation he received from the Prophet Joseph Smith some time after the Prophet was martyred According to President Woodruff s own account Joseph Smith came to me and spoke to me He said he could not stop to talk with me because he was in a hurry The next man I met was Father Smith he could not talk with me because he was in a hurry I met half a dozen brethren who had held high positions on earth and none of them could stop to talk with me because they were in a hurry I was much astonished By and by I saw the Prophet again and I got the privilege of asking him a question Now said I I want to know why you are in a hurry I have been in a hurry all my life but I expected my hurry would be over when I got into the kingdom of heaven if I ever did Joseph said I will tell you Brother Woodruff Every dispensation that has had the priesthood on the earth and has gone into the celestial kingdom has had a certain amount of work to do to prepare to go to the earth with the Savior when he goes to reign on the earth Each dispensation has had ample time to do this work We have not We are the last dispensation and so much work has to be done and we need to be in a hurry to accomplish it Of course that was satisfactory President Woodruff concluded but it was new doctrine to me 3Other latter day prophets have been similarly motivated to move us along more quickly in accomplishing the significant work of this last great dispensation President David O McKay encouraged every member to be a missionary 4 President Spencer W Kimball urged us to lengthen our stride 5 President Howard W Hunter affirmed We are at a time in the history of the world and the growth of the Church when we must think more of holy things and act more like the Savior would expect his disciples to act 6And now President Gordon B Hinckley is asking us to carry on to do better to do more He said We have work to do you and I so very much of it Let us roll up our sleeves and get at it with a new commitment putting our trust in the Lord We can do it if we will be prayerful and faithful 7Clearly the power of the Lord is moving on the leaders of the Church nudging them with the same urgency that seemed to be motivating Joseph Smith in Wilford Woodruff s vision President Hinckley is doing all that he can do to accelerate the work He is traveling the world to an unprecedented degree to strengthen and edify the Saints and to urge them upward and onward He has made himself available to the world media in order to share the message of the Restoration with the widest possible audience And he is overseeing the most extensive era of temple building in history in an attempt to speed up our ability to accomplish the overwhelming amount of work we have been assigned to complete in this dispensation of time Our President is dynamically out in front showing the way The question we must all ask ourselves is Are we keeping pace with him Each one of us must be prepared to answer that question I can assure you that it is a subject of considerable discussion among the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles I hope the same is true of every council in every ward and stake in the Church This is not the time to relax or to coast in our callings Every council of the Church should be working together on ways to be more effective in preparing our members to be worthy to enjoy all the blessings of the Church and especially the blessings of the temple We are rapidly approaching a time when the number of operating temples throughout the world will be double what it was just four short years ago Now is a good time to ask stake presidents and bishops what are your stake and ward councils doing to fill these temples with worthy members and sufficient dedicated workers Are your priesthood quorums functioning at peak efficiency Are the home and visiting teachers involved in serving those families to whom they are assigned Are your auxiliaries actively building faith and testimonies Are the activities in your stake and ward aimed at strengthening the family and every member Are you carefully coordinating the proselyting efforts with the stake and full time missionaries helping them to find teach and baptize many more people Are your councils concerning themselves with helping every new convert and less active member become fully fellowshipped and completely anchored to the doctrines of the Church Brothers and sisters there is much to be done by us to complete the work assigned by the Lord to this dispensation We must focus our work and we must work smarter if we are to accomplish our role in preparing all Church members to receive their temple blessings Church leaders both men and women can and must extend the length of their reach and broaden the power of their influence We must be wise to protect and teach our own families first and then take full advantage of the inspired Church council system to achieve greater success in the work Heavenly Father has given us to do within the time frame He has given us to do it Take for example the critical role of the ward council in fellowshipping every convert and activating those who are less active As each member now knows the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are greatly concerned over the well being of every new and less active member of the Church No ward or branch council should allow a new convert to feel insecure in his newly embraced Church membership And yet there are still too many of them who do not feel warmly welcomed Recently a new member wrote to me Sometimes I feel like it was a mistake for me to be baptized I know this Church is true and I have a strong testimony but I still question When I was investigating everyone from my ward were always there for me and always wanted to talk to me and always wanted to help me out Since I was baptized it s like they don t even notice when I go to church or when I don t I hardly hear from anybody I just can t understand why the people in my ward have just forgotten me I feel so lonely and confused I can t talk to my bishop because we aren t close at all He didn t even remember me when I went back to church Please help me if you can Brothers and sisters while wonderful progress has been made the time has come when we must marshal every resource to fellowship every convert and bless the lives of many more of our Heavenly Father s children This can best be accomplished when ward council members see that each organization does its part to make sure new members have friends have an assignment and are nourished by the good word of God Every soul is very precious to our Heavenly Father We must never forget that through the Atonement the Lord Jesus Christ paid a great price for the redemption of each one of us His suffering must not be in vain because we fail to nurture and teach those who are striving to be active in the Church You sisters can help build personal testimony in the lives of every woman young woman and child in the ward How grateful we are for your strength Sisters talk together in your councils about how to love support and teach each other the beautiful blessings and promises of the gospel How wonderful it would be if every woman in the world understood her true destiny as expressed in the Young Women theme You know the words We are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us and we love him We will stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places as we strive to live the Young Women Values which are Faith Divine Nature Individual Worth Knowledge Choice and Accountability Good Works and Integrity 8 Learning of and acting upon these values will save and bless both young and older women You members of the bishopric and Young Men presidency get close to each young man and help him to be worthy to be ordained at the assigned age to the appropriate priesthood This is a significant part of your work and the work of all the members of the ward council No boy should start out as a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood and fail to be ordained an elder and invited to serve a full time mission Melchizedek Priesthood quorums are responsible for the spiritual and temporal welfare of all men and their families Much of the work among the families of the ward that is currently being done by members of the bishopric could appropriately be performed by the men of the Melchizedek Priesthood if properly discussed and coordinated in council meetings Stake presidents and bishops if your councils are not focused and functioning at this increased level of spiritual power and direction then please do all you can to ensure that they understand how to combine all of the resources to spiritually prepare your people Similarly we as individuals and families need to counsel together to carefully examine ourselves and our personal and family commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ This examination is particularly essential to those of us who have made covenants of consecration and sacrifice in the house of the Lord We need to ask ourselves Are we setting an example of Christian virtue and gospel faithfulness in our lives and in our homes Are we reaching out to our inactive and nonmember friends family members and neighbors with loving concern Are we boldly sharing our testimonies I know the power of inspired men and women who unitedly strive to strengthen families and individual members of the Church Please fully utilize your combined ability to bless the lives of every person man or woman teenager or child member or nonmember who lives within the ward boundaries Brothers and sisters let us unite as never before to do our part individually and collectively to prepare our people to receive the blessings that can only be given in the house of the Lord This is our day brothers and sisters It is a time that has been foreseen by holy prophets since the world began It is the dispensation of the fulness of times when the final scenes of this world s history will be played out Our latter day prophets from Joseph Smith to Gordon B Hinckley have warned us of the solemn sobering obligation that is ours to prepare for the great and dreadful day of the Lord 9 That day is steadily moving toward us and there is still much to be done We must be prepared to keep pace with our leaders stride for their every lengthened stride Perhaps as never before we need to focus our efforts on those things that matter most and avoid spending time on those things of small concern and of little consequence Said the Prophet Joseph Smith Brethren shall we not go on in so great a cause Go forward and not backward Courage brethren and on on to the victory Let your hearts rejoice and be exceedingly glad Behold the great day of the Lord is at hand Let us as a church and a people and as Latter day Saints offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness and let us present in his holy temple a book containing the records of our dead which shall be worthy of all acceptation 10I pray that we may join together brothers and sisters to do our part to prepare every family adult youth and child to ultimately be worthy to receive every temple blessing that the gospel provides I bear my witness that the Lord Jesus Christ lives it is through Him that the eternal ordinances of the temple come to the faithful members of the Church May the Lord bless us with the desire the wisdom and the commitment to enthusiastically move this great work forward in our families and in the Church I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
One of the most extraordinary events in the history of mankind occurred on a spring day in 1820 when Joseph Smith Jr went into a grove of trees near his home to ask God for direction light and truth As he knelt in humble sincere prayer according to his own account of the event I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head above the brightness of the sun which descended gradually until it fell upon me When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air One of them spake unto me calling me by name and said pointing to the other This is My Beloved Son Hear Him 1At that moment the world became a different place The heavens long silent were once again opened and revealed light and truth poured forth that eventually resulted in the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints upon the earth These were incredible times as the spirit of revelation moved powerfully upon the Prophet Joseph Smith Often others were present with him when revelations were received and they bore witness of the Spirit and the outward manifestations that were present on these occasions Typically they spoke of a whiteness or a brightness that surrounded Joseph For example as the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given Philo Dibble wrote that Joseph seemed to be dressed in an element of glorious white and his face shone as if it were transparent 2 And Brigham Young testified that those who were acquainted with Joseph knew when the Spirit of revelation was upon him for his countenance wore an expression peculiar to himself while under that influence He preached by the Spirit of revelation and taught in his council by it and those who were acquainted with him could discover it at once for at such times there was a peculiar clearness and transparency in his face 3Some who shared in this marvelous revelatory experience were impressed with how smoothly these revelations from the Lord flowed and how except for minor corrections such as spelling or punctuation they required no editing Said Parley P Pratt Each sentence was uttered slowly and very distinctly and with a pause between each sufficiently long for it to be recorded by an ordinary writer in long hand There was never any hesitation reviewing or reading back in order to keep the run of the subject neither did any of these communications undergo revisions interlinings or corrections As he dictated them so they stood so far as I have witnessed and I was present to witness the dictation of several communications of several pages each 4Interestingly it was those who knew Joseph best who were most astonished at this process They understood more than anyone else the limitations of his formal education and natural ability Consequently they had the clearest view of the miraculous way God spoke through His living prophet Joseph s wife Emma bore a testimony similar to Parley P Pratt s in that she continued to be amazed at the process through which revelations came Years after the Prophet s death she said I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired for when acting as his scribe Joseph would dictate to me hour after hour and when returning after meals or after interruptions he could at once begin where he had left off without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him 5My dear brothers and sisters do we appreciate the marvelous miracle of revelation Through revelation we have received the Book of Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price which contain the words of God to us His children Oh how marvelous are the revelations we have received from the Lord I have often said either Joseph Smith was the Lord s instrument by which the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness was accomplished or he was not There is no possible compromise of this doctrine I raise my voice to the whole world in testimony that I know without reservation or question that Joseph Smith opened this dispensation through divine revelation and began the restoration to the earth of the true Church of Jesus Christ Among the most marvelous of revelations ever given to man is the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants often referred to simply as The Vision This vision may have been one of the Prophet Joseph s most powerful and significant spiritual experiences As he and Sidney Rigdon prayed to understand the resurrection of the just and the unjust this glorious vision or actually a series of six visions burst upon them Joseph and Sidney literally conversed with the Lord for about an hour and a half as the Savior showed them what Joseph later described as eternity sketch d in a vision from God Of what was and now is and yet is to be 6 As it commenced the two men viewed the glory of the Son of God on the right hand of the Father and were moved to exclaim And now after the many testimonies which have been given of him this is the testimony last of all which we give of him That he lives For we saw him even on the right hand of God and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father 7In sequence Joseph and Sidney next saw Lucifer in the premortal world as he fell from the presence of God because of his rebellion They then saw the sons of perdition and what will become of them in the eternal worlds Next they viewed visions of the celestial terrestrial and telestial kingdoms and they learned the requirements for attaining each of these kingdoms and the differences in glory of each respectively They learned that those who qualify for celestial glory shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever 8What a wondrous experience for the Prophet Joseph and Sidney For more than an hour the Lord showed them our premortal life earth life and life after death As a result of that revelation mankind s understanding of Heavenly Father s plan for our eternal happiness and peace was expanded and enhanced to a remarkable degree Of course it should be noted that Joseph was instructed not to record everything that he saw in vision The Saints at the time were not prepared to receive all of the new information that he was given But as we look at the Prophet s later teachings we see what appear to be bits and pieces of this great revelation being taught here a little and there a little as the Saints grew in their spiritual understanding That is why education particularly spiritual education is constantly stressed by the Lord We cannot be saved in ignorance 9 but the Lord can only reveal light and truth to us as we are prepared to receive it And so it is incumbent upon each of us to do everything we can to increase our spiritual knowledge and understanding by studying the scriptures and the words of the living prophets When we read and study the revelations the Spirit can confirm in our hearts the truth of what we are learning in this way the voice of the Lord speaks to each one of us 10 As we ponder the teachings of the gospel and apply them in daily living we become better prepared to receive additional light and truth Today I hope we are prepared and eager to understand what President Gordon B Hinckley is teaching us for he along with the other Apostles will teach us how to cope and how to live in these troubled times As promised in the scriptures Ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath prepared for you Ye cannot bear all things now nevertheless be of good cheer for I will lead you along The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours and the riches of eternity are yours 11How grateful I am for revelation that has enhanced my understanding of Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ and their gospel That knowledge has been a blessing in my life and in the lives of my family Several years ago we sat together in the Kirtland Temple and tried to imagine what it would have been like for the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery to see in revealed truth the blazing throne of God whereon was seated the Father and the Son 12 or to see the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit and hear Him say Your sins are forgiven you you are clean before me therefore lift up your heads and rejoice 13Can you imagine brothers and sisters how Joseph and Oliver must have felt as Moses Elias and Elijah appeared to them and committed keys dispensations and sealing powers not unlike what occurred on the Mount of Transfiguration about 2 000 years before I do not believe anyone seeking light and knowledge can read from the revelation given to President Joseph F Smith in October of 1918 and not feel the spirit and power of revealed truth The 138th section of the Doctrine and Covenants is filled with the doctrine about the eternal nature of man and the purpose of the great work of this Church President Smith said The eyes of my understanding were opened and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me and I saw the hosts of the dead both small and great And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality All these had departed the mortal life firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness and were rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand While this vast multitude waited and conversed rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death the Son of God appeared And there he preached to them the everlasting gospel the doctrine of the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall and from individual sins on conditions of repentance And the saints rejoiced in their redemption and bowed the knee and acknowledged the Son of God as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the chains of hell Their countenances shone and the radiance from the presence of the Lord rested upon them and they sang praises unto his holy name Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins without a knowledge of the truth or in transgression having rejected the prophets These were taught faith in God repentance from sin vicarious baptism for the remission of sins the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands And all other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know And so it was made known among the dead both small and great the unrighteous as well as the faithful that redemption had been wrought through the sacrifice of the Son of God upon the cross 14President Smith saw the work of prophets both ancient and modern foreshadowing the great work to be done in the temples of the Lord in the dispensation of the fulness of times for the redemption of the dead and the sealing of the children to their parents lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse and utterly wasted at his coming 15He beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation when they depart from mortal life continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead The dead who repent will be redeemed through obedience to the ordinances of the house of God And after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions and are washed clean shall receive a reward according to their works for they are heirs of salvation 16What great eternal light and knowledge comes to us from the marvelous revelations from God to His faithful prophets How grateful we should be for the understanding that has come to us as a result of all of the revelations that have been given to us in this last great dispensation Wherever I go in the world there are faithful members of the Church who know as I know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is true because it has been revealed to us by the power of the Spirit Anyone who sincerely wants to know can also have these truths confirmed to them by the same power of the Spirit My brothers and sisters we need to embrace study and appreciate the revealed truths that are ours We need to declare the gospel generously and kindly to all of our Father s children that every soul might walk in the light and the truth of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ May the Lord bless each one of us with increased knowledge and testimony and may we be open and receptive to the spirit of revelation as it has moved upon our prophets in the past and as it will yet move upon the prophets in the future is my humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 
It is a privilege brethren to speak to you this evening Brethren holding the priesthood is more than just a great blessing It also carries with it significant responsibilities such as watching over the Church honoring all women especially our wives our mothers our daughters our sisters visiting the home of each member exhorting each to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties 1 and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places 2When we covenant in the waters of baptism to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places we re not talking solely about fast and testimony meetings It may not always be easy convenient or politically correct to stand for truth and right but it is always the right thing to do Always Joseph F Smith was 19 when he returned from his mission in Hawaii As he traveled from California to his home in Utah he was confronted one morning by a wagonload of profane drunks shooting their guns yelling wildly and cursing the Mormons One of the drunks waving a pistol came toward him Although Joseph was terrified he felt it would be unwise and useless to run and so he advanced toward the gunman as if he found nothing out of the ordinary in his conduct Are you a Mormon the stranger demanded Mustering all the composure he could Joseph answered evenly while looking the man straight in the eye Yes siree dyed in the wool true blue through and through Almost stunned by this wholly unexpected response the gunman stopped dropped his hands to his sides and after looking incredulously at Joseph for a moment said in a subdued tone Well you are the pleasantest man I ever met Shake I am glad to see a fellow stand for his convictions So saying he turned and walked away 3As priesthood holders we have a sacred duty to always stand for truth and right The priesthood by definition is God s authority given to man to do the things that He would do if He were here That means we are not only His witnesses we are His representatives Standing for truth and right is not solely a Sunday thing Every day our neighborhoods and communities are in desperate need of our support and our commitment to safety and law and order Crime in all its pervasive manifestations is a serious worldwide evil and a moral problem about which Church leaders have great concern The social economic and moral costs of crime are incalculable It is no respecter of race religion nationality age culture or socioeconomic status The Book of Mormon teaches that secret combinations engaged in crime present a serious challenge not just to individuals and families but to entire civilizations Among today s secret combinations are gangs drug cartels and organized crime families The secret combinations of our day function much like the Gadianton robbers of the Book of Mormon times They have secret signs and code words They participate in secret rites and initiation ceremonies Among their purposes are to murder and plunder and steal and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God 4If we are not careful today s secret combinations can obtain power and influence just as quickly and just as completely as they did in Book of Mormon times Do you remember the pattern The secret combinations began among the more wicked part of society but eventually seduced the more part of the righteous until the whole society was polluted 5Today s young people just as those of the rising generation 6 in Book of Mormon times are the most susceptible to the influence of gangs Our young men and young women see it all around them There is an entire subculture that celebrates contemporary gangs and their criminal conduct with music clothing styles language attitudes and behaviors Many of you have watched as trendy friends have embraced the style as something that was fashionable and cool only to be dragged into the subculture because of their identification with gangs We ve all heard the tragic stories of unsuspecting wanna bes who have been victimized by gangs simply because they were wearing the wrong color in the wrong neighborhood The Book of Mormon teaches that the devil is the author of all sin and the founder of these secret combinations 7 He uses secret combinations including gangs from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men 8 His purpose is to destroy individuals families communities and nations 9 To a degree he was successful during Book of Mormon times And he is having far too much success today That s why it is so important for us as priesthood holders to take a firm stand for truth and right by doing what we can to help keep our communities safe Several years before Christ came to the American continent the Lamanites exercised such great faith and courage that they completely destroyed the influence of the Gadianton robbers in their society by preach ing the word of God among them 10 Brethren we are now in a similar position to stand as witnesses of God by setting an example keeping Church standards and sharing our testimony with those around us The Savior has promised that if we will keep all the commandments and covenants by which we are bound He will cause the heavens to shake for our good and Satan shall tremble and Zion shall rejoice upon the hills and flourish 11 He has even promised that the day will come when because of the righteousness of his people Satan will have no power over the hearts of men 12As a Church we recognize that the gospel of Jesus Christ with its saving truths and teachings provides the most effective preventative and rehabilitative assistance in overcoming criminal behavior Parents bear the first and greatest responsibility to teach their children principles of gospel living and good citizenship There are however those who have little or no support at home We need to be aware of them and do all we can to bless their lives They need positive role models who demonstrate integrity by honoring their covenants and keeping their promises To you brethren who are fathers bishopric members and youth leaders Please remember that all young men and young women have a great need to feel loved respected and valued and to succeed in ways that will help them gain a sense of confidence and self worth Appropriate and uplifting activities should be planned that will provide a safe and wholesome environment in which our youth and their nonmember friends can strengthen one another and draw closer to the Savior We should also support the efforts of individuals organizations communities and governments to assist them and help prevent crime We should work within our respective legal and judicial systems to enact and enforce laws that provide necessary protection against criminals while ensuring essential rights and freedoms And we should volunteer to support and assist government leaders in promoting programs designed to protect and strengthen families and communities Many of you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood may find yourselves on the front line of a battle against those who intend to do things that are morally wrong I do not believe that you can stand for truth and right while wearing anything that is unbecoming one who holds the priesthood of God To me it is impossible to maintain the Spirit of the Lord while listening to music or watching movies or videos that celebrate evil thoughts and use vulgar language I know it is sometimes hard to stand for truth and right Yet we need to be positive examples if we are to help others find a better way Thankfully we can draw strength from those who have gone before us While the road they walked may have been different from the road we walk today the courage required to be faithful is similar and their experiences are instructive As a boy growing up in Nauvoo George Q Cannon learned to cope with those who would do harm to others In his own words he tells how he and a group of boys his age did their part to defend the Saints against potential troublemakers It was a common practice when engaged in conversation or in making a bargain to take out pocket knives and commence whittling frequently accompanying the whittling by whistling No person could object therefore to the practices of whittling and whistling Many of the boys of the city had each a large bowie knife made and when a man came to town who was known to be a villain and was there for evil purposes a few of them would get together and go to where the obnoxious person was and having previously provided themselves with pine shingles would commence whittling The presence of a number of boys each harmlessly whittling was not a sight to escape the notice of a stranger His first reaction would be to ask what this meant The boys would make no reply but with grave faces keep up their harmless whistling What could the man do If he was armed he could shoot but the resolute expression of the boys faces and the gleaming knives would convince him that discretion was the better part of valor The most we ever knew them to do was to stand for awhile and curse and threaten Then they would walk off followed by the troop of boys vigorously whittling and whistling 13Now I m not suggesting that we begin issuing bowie knives to our deacons But I am suggesting that George Q Cannon and his youthful associates exhibited great courage and faith by their actions They saw something that needed to be done and they did it safely within the context of what was appropriate for the times I m impressed by their willingness to take a stand against wicked intentions of others Dealing with crime is very complex However there are some simple things that we can do in our day to prevent others from drifting toward gangs and crime We can avoid the temptation of being cliquish at school or at church All of us can refrain from finding fault or alienating anyone by our words or actions Nothing is more hurtful than to feel left out or made fun of Therefore we must never do anything that may drive others toward being accepted by a gang because they feel rejected by us Many new families are moving in among us Brethren reach out the hand of friendship and make everyone feel welcome and secure in our neighborhoods and in our Church Guard against spreading rumors or saying unkind things or allowing anything to occur that may hurt another Make friends with your neighbors watch out for each other and help build a spirit of unity peace and love among them These may seem like small things but I assure you if we do these kinds of things they may be every bit as effective in keeping people away from evil and crime as whittling and whistling were in the days of Nauvoo True friendship may well be the best thing that we can do to help reach those who may be drifting toward unsafe and morally damaging activities and counterfeit forms of belonging There are countless stories that could be told of bright talented priesthood holders who have influenced for good the lives of others Unfortunately there are also stories of those who fell short of their potential because they were unwilling to take such a stand for truth and right Some young men and young women have rationalized their bad choices saying that we all make mistakes But you must understand that there is a big difference between an honest mistake made in a moment of spiritual weakness and a willful decision to disobey persistently the commandments of God Those who deliberately choose to violate God s commandments or ignore the standards of the Church even when promising themselves and others that someday they will be strong enough to repent are stepping onto a dangerously slippery slope upon which many have lost their spiritual footing While it is true that some young people have made remarkable recoveries from sin through the process of repentance the sad reality is that others have lost their way because of the paths they have chosen to follow These are difficult times in which we are living In some respects it is perhaps the most challenging age of all time We want you young men to know that we are aware of that But we are also aware that God has reserved some of His strongest spirit children for these perilous days While God s laws and standards of right and wrong are under attack at every turn we are a great army of priesthood holders who are prepared to make a valiant stand for truth and right Brethren let us stand shoulder to shoulder as bearers of the priesthood of God and as followers of Christ and do what we can to make this a better safer and happier world Let us be witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
For the past several months the attention of the Church has been focused on the extraordinary events surrounding the establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints here in the Salt Lake Valley and elsewhere throughout the world It is wonderful to note that the wards and stakes are using the yearlong pioneer sesquicentennial celebration as an opportunity to honor the Utah pioneers of 1847 as well as the remarkable efforts of our pioneers in every land who have blazed spiritual trails with faith in every one of their footsteps The handcart built in Siberia and presently moving through the missions of Russia and Ukraine is a wonderful example of the worldwide effort to honor our pioneers Plans are for the handcart to be pulled down Emigration Canyon on the final leg of its journey arriving at This Is the Place State Park on July 22 This is a year for remembering our past and drawing strength to face and conquer the challenges of today from the exemplary faith and courage of those who faced and conquered the challenges of yesterday As we honor these great pioneers from many lands we shall share historical accounts that will often bring tears to our eyes and feelings of pure gratitude to our hearts Through music drama and stirring reenactments we will be reminded of incredible pioneer journeys both temporal and spiritual We cannot begin to understand the journeys made by those who laid the foundation of this dispensation until we understand their spiritual underpinnings Once we make that connection however we will begin to see how their journeys parallel our own There are lessons for us in every footstep they took lessons of love courage commitment devotion endurance and most of all faith For the Utah pioneers of 1847 their faith was grounded in principle They left their homes their temple and in some cases their families in search of a place of refuge where they could worship without fear of persecution There was little that they could carry with them in the way of provisions and material possessions but each wagon and handcart was heavily laden with faith faith in God faith in the Restoration of His Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith and faith that God knew where they were going and that He would see them through One of those who traveled the Mormon Trail in 1847 referred to it as the trail of hope I love that title trail of hope It speaks of the universal yearning of each person to find a safe haven a community of Saints where hearts are united and hope prevails Those 19th century pioneers to whom we pay special tribute during this sesquicentennial year never set out to be heroes and yet they accomplished heroic things That is what makes them Saints They were a band of believers who tried to do the right thing for the right reasons ordinary men and women who were called on to perform an extraordinary work At times they gave in to discouragement and allowed themselves to murmur and complain But ultimately their faith in God and the man they sustained as their prophet and leader prevailed and they righted their vision and attitudes along with their wagons In the process they found joy amid the hardships and trials of the trek Nearly seven years before the pioneer exodus to the mountains of Utah William Clayton wrote to his fellow Saints in England urging them to come to Zion not realizing that Zion would soon be in wagons and handcarts moving west He wrote Although we are distant from each other I do not forget you But to the praise of God be it spoken all I have endured has never hurt or discouraged me but done me good We have sometimes been almost suffocated with heat sometimes almost froze with cold We have had to sleep on boards instead of feathers We have had our clothes wet through with no privilege of drying them or changing them had to sleep out of doors in very severe weather and many such things which you have no idea of Yet we have been healthy cheerful If you will be faithful you have nothing to fear from the journey The Lord will take care of his saints 1William Clayton would later pen the lyrics to Come Come Ye Saints Hymns no 30 during the trek across Iowa He and a host of others would learn even more intimately during the 1 300 mile exodus to Utah that there is nothing to fear from the journey if faith is your constant companion Is there a lesson in the pioneer experience for us today I believe there is The faith that motivated the pioneers of 1847 as well as pioneers in other lands was a simple faith centered in the basic doctrines of the restored gospel which they knew to be true That s all that mattered to them and I believe that is all that should matter to us Our faith needs to be focused on the fundamental truths that God lives that we are His children and that Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten Son and He is our Savior We need to know that they restored the Church to the earth in its fulness through the Prophet Joseph Smith Through the restored gospel of Jesus Christ we learn that our Father s plan for the happiness of His children is clear and quite simple when studied and accepted with real faith Traveling from Nauvoo to the valley of the Great Salt Lake in 1847 is not unlike a young missionary from Idaho traveling to Siberia in late 1993 as one of the first Latter day Saints to labor in that land Nearly every day our missionaries arrive in countries where they have little knowledge of the language and where the food culture and living conditions are often much different from that which they are accustomed to And yet they go boldly as modern pioneers not fearing the journey walking with faith in every footstep to bring to people everywhere the good news of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Our faith can help us be equally bold and fearless during the course of our respective journeys whether we are parents working with a troubled child a single parent trying to raise a worthy family young people struggling to find a place in a wicked and confusing world or a single person trying to make the journey through life alone No matter how difficult the trail and regardless of how heavy our load we can take comfort in knowing that others before us have borne life s most grievous trials and tragedies by looking to heaven for peace comfort and hopeful assurance We can know as they knew that God is our Father that He cares about us individually and collectively and that as long as we continue to exercise our faith and trust in Him there is nothing to fear in the journey Like the pioneers of 1847 who ventured west along a trail that kept them relatively close to life sustaining fresh water from rivers particularly the Platte and the Sweetwater we need to follow and partake of the Living Water of Christ to refresh our faith and sustain our efforts as we travel the road through mortality Life isn t always easy At some point in our journey we may feel much as the pioneers did as they crossed Iowa up to our knees in mud forced to bury some of our dreams along the way We all face rocky ridges with the wind in our face and winter coming on too soon Sometimes it seems as though there is no end to the dust that stings our eyes and clouds our vision Sharp edges of despair and discouragement jut out of the terrain to slow our passage Always there is a Devil s Gate which will swing wide open to lure us in Those who are wise and faithful will steer a course as far from such temptation as possible while others sometimes those who are nearest and dearest to us succumb to the attraction of ease comfort convenience and rest Occasionally we reach the top of one summit in life as the pioneers did only to see more mountain peaks ahead higher and more challenging than the one we have just traversed Tapping unseen reservoirs of faith and endurance we as did our forebears inch ever forward toward that day when our voices can join with those of all pioneers who have endured in faith singing All is well All is well Hymns no 30 And how will we feel then as we stand shoulder to shoulder with the great pioneers of Church history How will they feel about us Will they see faith in our footsteps I believe they will particularly as they view our lives and experiences from the expanded perspective of eternity Although our journeys today are less demanding physically than the trek of our pioneers 150 years ago they are no less challenging Certainly it was hard to walk across a continent to establish a new home in a dry western desert But who can say if that was any more difficult than is the task of living faithful righteous lives in today s confusingly sinful world where the trail is constantly shifting and where divine markers of right and wrong are being replaced by political expediency and diminishing morality The road we travel today is treacherous and the scriptures tell us it will continue to be so until the very end But our reward will be the same as that which awaits worthy pioneers of all ages who live faithfully the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ make right choices and give their all to build the kingdom of God on earth We are the inheritors of a tremendous heritage Now it is our privilege and responsibility to be part of the Restoration s continuing drama and there are great and heroic stories of faith to be written in our day It will require every bit of our strength wisdom and energy to overcome the obstacles that will confront us But even that will not be enough We will learn as did our pioneer ancestors that it is only in faith real faith whole souled tested and tried that we will find safety and confidence as we walk our own perilous pathways through life We are all bound together 19th and 20th century pioneers and more in our great journey to follow the Lord Jesus Christ and to allow His atoning sacrifice to work its miracle in our lives While we all can appreciate the footsteps of faith walked by Joseph Smith and his followers from Palmyra to Carthage Jail and across the Great Plains we should ever stand in reverential awe as we contemplate the path trod by the Master His faithful footsteps to Gethsemane and to Calvary rescued all of us and opened the way for us to return to our heavenly home Let us remember that the Savior is the Way the Truth and the Life and there can be no greater promise than to know that if we are faithful and true we will one day be safely encircled in the arms of His love see D C 6 20 He is always there to give encouragement to forgive and to rescue Therefore as we exercise faith and are diligent in keeping the commandments we have nothing to fear from the journey Three of my grandsons stood with me on the crest of the hill known as the Eminence last summer Looking down at the Sweetwater where the Willie Company was stranded cold and starving we read from their journals of the joy of their rescue As John Chislett wrote Just as the sun was sinking beautifully behind the distant hills several covered wagons were seen coming towards us The news ran through the camp like wildfire Shouts of joy rent the air strong men wept till tears ran freely down their furrowed and sun burnt cheeks That evening for the first time in quite a period the songs of Zion were to be heard in the camp With the cravings of hunger satisfied and with hearts filled with gratitude to God and our good brethren we all united in prayer and then retired to rest 2At that moment standing on the same hill from which the Willie Company first saw their rescuers I contemplated the joy that will fill our hearts when we fully come to know the eternal significance of the greatest rescue the rescue of the family of God by the Lord Jesus Christ For it is through Him that we have promise of eternal life Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the source of spiritual power that will give you and me the assurance that we have nothing to fear from the journey I know the Lord Jesus Christ lives and our unwavering faith in Him will see us safely along our journey through life to which I humbly testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
This year 1996 we have enjoyed a great centennial celebration of statehood in Utah that has given our citizens an opportunity to reflect upon the important accomplishments of the past 100 years In 1997 the Church will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley During the sesquicentennial year Church members worldwide will have the opportunity to focus their attention on the pioneer trek from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley The theme for the sesquicentennial celebration is Faith in Every Footstep This August I walked in the footsteps of our pioneers along the Mormon Trail through Wyoming and Utah I wondered why our dedicated ancestors suffered so terribly and yet willingly faced such tremendous obstacles Perhaps one reason they sacrificed and endured was to leave a legacy of faith for all of us to help us feel our urgent responsibility to move forward in building up the Church throughout the world We need the same dedication today in every one of our footsteps as the pioneers had in theirs President Joseph F Smith who walked the pioneer trail to Utah as a nine year old boy said in the April 1904 general conference I firmly believe that the divine approval blessing and favor of Almighty God has guided the destiny of His people from the organization of the Church until the present and guided us in our footsteps and in our journeyings into the tops of these mountains 1 Our pioneer ancestors sacrificed virtually all they had including their lives in many cases to follow a prophet of God to this chosen valley Next year s celebration will honor pioneers worldwide in addition to the Utah pioneers As chairman of the Church sesquicentennial committee I ask you stake and ward leaders to place the Church sesquicentennial celebration on your next council meeting agenda Please study the guidelines sent to you in January 1995 and the additional information sent in intervening months In your councils choose the activities that will be appropriate and important to ensure a spiritually fulfilling experience for your members in 1997 The vast majority of the Utah pioneers got their first glimpse of the sagebrush sego lily salt flat desert landscape of this Great Salt Lake Valley on foot Some even arrived barefoot after having suffered extreme hardships in traversing over 1 300 miles of prairie desert and mountain wilderness Before the railroad reached the Utah Territory in 1869 approximately 70 000 pioneers 9 600 wagons and 650 handcarts made the trek from Winter Quarters in present day Iowa and Nebraska to the Salt Lake Valley 2 Each pioneer who walked from the Mississippi River to the Great Salt Lake took millions of steps to travel that distance Under favorable circumstances the trek took a little more than three months Traveling 15 miles in a day was considered a good day In total billions of footsteps of faith were taken by our pioneers On the trail a loving attachment frequently developed between a pioneer and his ox team Joseph F Smith related My team leaders names were Thom and Joe we raised them from calves and they were both white Thom was trim built active young and more intelligent than many a man Many times while traveling sandy or rough roads on long thirsty drives my oxen were lowing with the heat and fatigue I would put my arms around Thom s neck and cry bitter tears That was all I could do Thom was my favorite and best and most willing and obedient servant and friend 3The pioneer exodus from Nauvoo Illinois began February 4 1846 Nearly four years earlier in August of 1842 the Prophet Joseph Smith shared his foreknowledge of the trek west I prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains many would apostatize others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease and some would live to build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains 4Brigham Young received a vision of Joseph Smith in which Joseph showed him a mountain and an ensign upon its peak Joseph said Build under the point where the colors fall and you will prosper and have peace 5 The identification of this mountain peak as the Saints entered Salt Lake Valley in July 1847 confirmed to President Young that the pioneers had found their destination their Zion in the tops of the mountains We know this conical dome shaped mountain today as Ensign Peak It rises above the valley floor just north of where we now sit The exodus from Nauvoo and across the prairies rivers and mountains to the Salt Lake Valley was a migration of major proportions Near Mount Pisgah one of the communities the Saints established in Iowa Wilford Woodruff recorded I stopped my carriage and had a most splendid view I could stand and gaze to the east west north and south and behold the Saints pouring out from the hills and dales with their teams wagons flocks and herds by hundreds and thousands until it looked like the movements of a great nation 6As the pioneers traveled across Iowa their worries centered on food and forage wood and fire and ceaseless snow rain and mud A broken axle or a missing ox became a crisis 7 Tragic illness overcame many who were wet chilled weak and malnourished The 265 mile trek from Nauvoo to Winter Quarters took 131 days By comparison the trek from Winter Quarters to the Salt Lake Valley which was about four times the distance approximately 1 032 miles took only 111 days 8Perhaps the most memorable pioneer stalwarts were the Saints who made the journey in handcart companies These companies brought nearly 3 000 pioneers west between 1856 and 1860 9 In 1856 two handcart companies with 1 075 pioneers under the leadership of James G Willie and Edward Martin left later in the year than planned and they encountered early winter storms in present day Wyoming 10 Peter Howard McBride then but a boy of six years was a member of the Martin Company His father after helping push handcarts through the icy river died in the snow and freezing cold that night Peter s mother was sick his older sister Jenetta watched out for the younger children Her shoes had worn out and her feet left bloody tracks in the snow On the banks of the Sweetwater River the wind blew their tent down during the night Everyone scampered out as the snow covered the tent everyone except little Peter According to his account In the morning I heard someone say How many are dead in this tent My sister said Well my little brother must be frozen to death in that tent So they jerked the tent loose sent it scurrying over the snow My hair was frozen to the tent I picked myself up and came out quite alive to their surprise 11We find one of the most touching stories of sacrifice faith and loving charity in the life of Jens Neilson who was a member of the Willie Handcart Company Jens a relatively prosperous Danish farmer heeded the call to bring his family to Zion In Iowa he wrote that he had let all of his money go to the Church except enough to buy a handcart and stock it with 15 pounds of belongings per person Jens wrote Obedience is better than sacrifice The people for whom Jens was responsible were himself his wife Elsie their six year old son Neils and a nine year old girl Bodil Mortensen whom Jens offered to take to Utah In the early Wyoming blizzard temperatures plummeted below zero The Neilsons had consumed their last pound of flour days before but somehow they made it over the treacherous Rocky Ridge urged on by their indomitable courage and unconquerable faith Tragically 13 of the company died at Rock Creek and were buried in shallow snow covered graves among them Jens and Elsie s son Neils and young Bodil Mortensen President Hinckley describes this portion of the trail as a trail of tragedy a trail of faith a trail of devotion a trail of consecration even the consecration of life itself 12Jens arrived at Rock Creek 11 miles beyond Rocky Ridge with both feet frozen He was unable to walk another step and pleaded with Elsie Leave me by the trail in the snow to die and you go ahead and try to keep up with the company and save your life Elsie with her unfaltering pioneer courage replied Ride I can t leave you I can pull the cart 13 Such was the strength and the faith of many pioneer women on the trail A cow helped provide necessary nourishment on the trail for the family of my great grandmother Margaret McNeil as she came to Zion from Scotland As a 12 year old it was Margaret s task to arise early and get breakfast for the family and milk her cow She would then drive the cow on ahead of the company to let it feed in the grassy places She wrote The cow furnished us with milk our chief source of food Had it not been for the milk we would have starved One night our cow ran away from the camp and I was sent to bring her back I was not watching where I was going and was barefooted All of a sudden I began to feel I was walking on something soft I looked down to see what it could be and to my horror found that I was standing in a bed of snakes large ones and small ones At the sight of them I became so weak I could scarcely move all I could think of was to pray and in some way I jumped out of them The Lord blessed and cared for me We arrived in Ogden Utah on the fourth day of October 1859 after a journey of hardships and hunger I walked every step of the way across the plains 14President Joseph F Smith who took part in the westward trek and in the first 70 years of hardship in this valley shared this precious overview of the Lord s protective hand over His Latter day Saints Our good friends from the east used to come out here in the early days and upbraid us They said Why it is the fulfillment of the curse of God upon you You have been driven away from the rich lands of Illinois and Missouri into a desert into a salt land I said Yes we have salt enough here to save the world thank God and we may find use for it by and by 15 There was a time when there wasn t feed for livestock and the beef was so lean there wasn t enough fat to even make decent soap Just then the Lord sent a handful of alfalfa seed into the valley and Christopher Layton planted it watered it and it matured and from that little beginning Utah can now produce a richer crop of hay than Illinois or Missouri can do 16Truly the Lord encourages us to walk in faith to the edge of the light and beyond into the unknown After the trial of our faith He once again shines the light ahead of us and our journey of faith in every footstep continues Now it has swelled into billions and billions of footsteps throughout the world In my 20 years as a General Authority I have seen the worldwide expansion of the Church and I marvel at the results of the work of our pioneers in every country where they through their faith and sacrifice established the Church I share the feelings of President Heber J Grant who said I can never think of the pioneers but I am full of admiration and gratitude and utter a prayer to the Lord to help me as one of the descendants of that noble band to be loyal to be true to be faithful as they were 17Brothers and sisters join with us and begin now to prepare for a spiritual journey next year by walking in the footsteps of our beloved pioneers in every land We must be sure that the legacy of faith received from them is never lost Let their heroic lives touch our hearts and especially the hearts of our youth so the fire of true testimony and unwavering love for the Lord and His Church will blaze brightly within each one of us as it did in our faithful pioneers Their accomplishments were possible because they knew as I know that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ restored the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith and that this Church will continue to roll forth until it fills the whole earth To this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters this has been another glorious conference I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to be with me as I now have the privilege to speak to you In February Sister Ballard and I attended a multistake conference in Johannesburg South Africa We were impressed with the faith and the special spirit of the members Visiting the African continent brought back memories of my earlier assignments to East and West Africa I thought once again of the special fast by Church members worldwide in 1985 It provided approximately six million dollars to relieve suffering and hunger primarily in drought stricken Ethiopia Brother Glenn L Pace and I witnessed firsthand the fruits of generous contributions by Church members when the First Presidency assigned us to go to Africa assess the needs of the people and recommend how to make the best use of these special funds We visited refugee camps in that arid country The land was as barren as any I had ever seen We visited Red Cross centers and field hospitals where the desperately ill were being cared for Such dreadful pitiful suffering broke our hearts We saw sick mothers lying on cots trying to feed and comfort their children many of whom had the sunken eyes and pencil thin arms and legs of those in the advanced stages of starvation This was one of the most heart wrenching experiences of my life I had never seen anything that touched my heart so deeply as the anxious yearning for food and nourishment that I saw there Brothers and sisters even as people in Ethiopia were starving physically because of the lack of food far too many people in the world are starving spiritually Sadly most of them have no idea where to find real spiritual nourishment They wander to and fro another form of pathetic refugees Those who yearn for true spiritual light and knowledge can only find it through the power of the Holy Ghost The Spirit enlightens and gives understanding of the eternal purposes of life By the Spirit Church members know the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is true We should therefore feel compelled to share our spiritual knowledge with all of our Father s children by inviting them to pull a chair up to the Lord s table and feast on the words of Christ Come unto the Holy One of Israel wrote the great Book of Mormon prophet Jacob and feast upon that which perisheth not neither can be corrupted and let your soul delight in fatness 1 Later Nephi urged his followers to feast upon the words of Christ for behold the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do 2God s chosen prophet President Gordon B Hinckley recently said Every member of this church is an individual man or woman boy or girl Our great responsibility is to see that each is remembered and nourished by the good word of God Moro 6 4 that each has opportunity for growth and expression and training in the work and ways of the Lord This work is concerned with people each a son or daughter of God In describing its achievements we speak in terms of numbers but all of our efforts must be dedicated to the development of the individual 3For The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints to fulfill its divine mission to assist in bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 4all members need to generate an appetite for gospel sustenance We must hunger and thirst after righteousness 5 before we can be filled We need to cultivate spiritual strength within ourselves before we can ever hope to engender it in others Individual personal testimony of gospel truth particularly the divine life and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ is essential to our eternal life And this is life eternal said the Savior that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent 6 In other words life eternal is predicated upon our own individual personal knowledge of our Father in Heaven and His Holy Son Simply knowing about them is not enough We must have personal spiritual experiences to anchor us These come through seeking them in the same intense single minded way that a hungry person seeks food Once again quoting President Hinckley The gaining of a strong and secure testimony is the privilege and opportunity of every individual member of the Church The Master said If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself John 7 17 Service in behalf of others study and prayer lead to faith in this work and then to knowledge of its truth This has always been a personal pursuit as it must always be in the future 7We must fortify ourselves before we can ever hope to offer spiritual nourishment to others Once we have nourished ourselves with the good word of Christ and feasted personally at His table so that our testimony is strong and vibrant we are obligated to join with the missionaries in a balanced effort to invite others beginning with our families to the spiritual banquet As the Lord said to His beloved Apostle Peter When thou art converted strengthen thy brethren 8 And again speaking to Peter the Savior asked Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time Lovest thou me And he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus saith unto him Feed my sheep 9If we are obedient to the Savior s command given to Peter we will focus our attention on the spiritual growth and development of those for whom we are responsible Feeding the Lord s sheep requires each of us to awaken our interest in others The duty to invite others to partake of the gospel feast does not rest only on the shoulders of the missionaries That sober and significant duty belongs to each member of the Church for it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor 10Today our prophet is calling for enthusiastic and dynamic love for our Heavenly Father s children He asks us to see the spiritual hunger around us and to respond by willingly sharing our abundance No power on earth can accomplish as much as one righteous man or woman or boy or girl The home and family have vital roles in cultivating and developing personal faith and testimony The family is the basic unit of society the best place for individuals to build faith and strong testimonies is in righteous homes filled with love Love for our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ is greatly enhanced when the gospel is taught and lived in the home True principles of eternal life are embedded in the hearts and souls of young and old alike when scriptures are read and discussed when prayers are offered morning and night and where reverence for God and obedience to Him are modeled in everyday conduct Just as the best meals are home cooked the most nourishing gospel instruction takes place at home Strong faithful families have the best opportunity to produce strong faithful members of the Church The recent proclamation to the world on the family issued by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles makes very clear that the family is ordained of God The proclamation warns that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets The family is where the foundation of personal spiritual growth is built and nurtured the Church then is the scaffolding that helps support and strengthen the family While the Church is secondary to the family in teaching gospel principles much spiritual learning and growth come through the Church For example carefully planned sacrament meetings should be a spiritual feast in which we worship and learn of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Bishops if your sacrament meetings are less than a banquet of spiritual nourishment I urge you to invite suggestions from your ward council especially the sisters on ways to make every sacrament meeting a more reverent spiritual experience Let the council also help teach our members that the chapel is a special place in our buildings where we come in a spirit of respect for God and reverence for His holy Son Let the quiet peaceful promptings of the Holy Spirit abide in our worship services causing spiritual enlightenment and nourishment to flow into our lives Whether we are teaching in the home or in the Church we must keep a clear vision of the gospel s eternal purpose Not long ago I experienced the kind of faith and spiritual strength the gospel provides when an 18 year old sister who was fighting for her life in a battle with cancer asked me for a blessing She said Brother Ballard I am not afraid to die I would like to live There are things I would still like to accomplish in this life but I know that Jesus is my Savior and my Redeemer During these past few years He has become my best friend I trust Him and I trust you as His representative Whatever He wants for me I am prepared We pled for a miracle but at her request left the matter with Heavenly Father She died shortly thereafter with the peace of the Lord attending her and her faithful family Brothers and sisters we should teach revealed principles and inspired doctrine in our homes and in our Church meetings Every parent and class instructor should be well prepared to teach the gospel by the power of the Spirit to ensure that testimonies are renewed and understanding of life and life eternal is fortified The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles ask leaders to emphasize constantly in priesthood quorums auxiliaries and stake and ward councils the preeminence of the home and family That is where scriptures are studied and prayers are offered regularly so all family members will strive to follow the Savior in all things Leaders also need to emphasize that all adult members of the Church should strive to become worthy to receive the ordinances of the temple They should identify their ancestors and perform the sacred temple ordinances for them Parents and leaders need to do everything possible to prepare each young man to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and the ordinances of the temple and to serve a full time mission Likewise young women need to prepare to make and keep sacred covenants and receive temple ordinances Making and keeping sacred covenants in the house of the Lord is the most delicious course at the Lord s table It is the ultimate satisfying spiritual feast of the gospel of Jesus Christ in mortality it has eternal consequences Our living prophet has expressed his great vision of those who qualify for temple ordinances keep temple covenants and serve regularly in the house of the Lord We would be a better people President Hinckley said There would be little or no infidelity among us Divorce would almost entirely disappear So much of heartache and heartbreak would be avoided There would be a greater measure of peace and love and happiness in our homes There would be fewer weeping wives and weeping children There would be a greater measure of appreciation and of mutual respect among us And I am confident the Lord would smile with greater favor upon us 11Through His prophet God has promised to replace the spiritual hunger that plagues mankind with untold bounty from His own table All He asks is that we come unto Christ and then do all we can through our families and with the support of the Church to help all of our Father s children succeed spiritually in this critical journey of mortality Behold said the Lord I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me 12I testify to you that Jesus is the Christ He lives and invites everyone to partake of the joyful feast of the gospel Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days May we all be blessed my beloved brothers and sisters with an increased desire to seek after and feast on the things of the Spirit I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters I am grateful to be able to stand before you today After undergoing heart bypass surgery two months ago I am grateful to be able to stand anywhere I have felt the powerful faith and prayers of Church members exercised in my behalf these past months for which I express my sincere appreciation I have been greatly blessed and publicly express humble gratitude to my Heavenly Father During the early part of July Sister Ballard and I had the opportunity to travel to Church historic sites in Palmyra Kirtland and Nauvoo with our seven children their companions and twenty of our grandchildren Some people have suggested this may have contributed to my heart problems I don t know about that but I do know that our tour of these locations filled our souls with an ever greater love and respect for the Prophet Joseph Smith for his family and for the stalwarts who first embraced the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and became members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints What an extraordinary experience it was to teach my family from the Doctrine and Covenants while standing on the very ground where many of those revelations and instructions were received Visiting those inspirational sites and immersing ourselves as a family in the events of the Restoration reminded me again of the marvelous privilege we have to live in a day when we have such clear doctrinal understanding of our Heavenly Father s plan for the salvation and exaltation of his children The clarity of our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ and his restored church is precious empowering knowledge for each one of us I thank God that in these difficult days of moral decay and departure from sound values we have no shortage of revealed truth to guide our lives During the past several weeks of physical recovery I have found myself with more time on my hands than I am accustomed to with an unscheduled opportunity to think to ponder and to pray I do not recommend the course of action that brought this gift of time to me but I believe all of us would benefit from time to ponder and meditate In the quiet moments of personal introspection the Spirit can teach us much The Spirit has confirmed to me the important responsibility we have to see that the legacy of faith of our pioneer forefathers is never lost We can derive great strength particularly our youth from understanding our Church history As a descendant of Hyrum Smith I feel a solemn obligation to ensure that the Church never forgets the significant ministry of this great leader Recognizing that no one save Jesus only excels the singular accomplishment of the Prophet Joseph I am stirred within my soul to remember and respect the valiant life and remarkable contributions of his older brother the patriarch Hyrum In September of 1840 Joseph Smith Sr gathered his family around him This venerable patriarch was dying and wanted to leave his blessing on his beloved wife and children Hyrum the eldest living son asked his father to intercede with heaven when he arrived there so the enemies of the Church may not have so much power over the Latter day Saints Father Smith then laid his hands upon Hyrum s head and blessed him to have peace sufficient to accomplish the work which God has given you to do Knowing of Hyrum s lifelong faithfulness he concluded this last blessing with the promise that Hyrum would be as firm as the pillars of heaven unto the end of his days 1This blessing identified Hyrum s strongest characteristic More than anything else he was firm as the pillars of heaven Throughout Hyrum s life the forces of evil combined against him in an attempt to defeat him or at least to prompt him to stray off course After his older brother Alvin s death in 1823 Hyrum bore significant responsibility in the Smith family At the same time he assisted and served his brother Joseph the Prophet throughout the long and arduous process of the Restoration Ultimately he joined Joseph and other martyrs of past gospel dispensations His blood was shed as his final testimony to the world Through it all Hyrum stood firm He knew the course his life would take and he consciously chose to follow it To Joseph Hyrum became companion protector provider confidant and eventually joined him as a martyr Unjust persecution engulfed them throughout their lives Although he was older Hyrum recognized his brother s divine mantle While he gave Joseph strong counsel on occasion Hyrum always deferred to his younger brother Speaking to his brother Joseph once said Brother Hyrum what a faithful heart you have got Oh may the Eternal Jehovah crown eternal blessings upon your head as a reward for the care you have had for my soul O how many are the sorrows we have shared together 2On another occasion Joseph referred to his brother with these profound and tender words I love him with that love that is stronger than death 3Hyrum gave unfailing service to the Church In 1829 he was among a handful of individuals who were allowed to view the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated and for the rest of his life he testified to the divine nature of the Book of Mormon as one of the Eight Witnesses who had seen the plates with his eyes and handled them with his hands 4 He was among the first to be baptized in this gospel dispensation At age thirty he was the oldest of the six men chosen in 1830 to formally organize The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints In 1831 he stood before the Ohio conference and pledged that all he had was the Lord s and he was ready to do his will continually 5 In 1833 when the Lord chastised the Church for delaying the start of the Kirtland Temple Hyrum was the first to start digging its foundation As chairman of the temple committee Hyrum rallied the Church to perform the seemingly impossible task of building the Kirtland Temple when most Church members literally had nothing to give to the cause A few years later he repeated this service with the building of the Nauvoo Temple Hyrum served in the Ohio bishopric on the first high council as Patriarch counselor in the First Presidency and finally as one of only two men ever to hold the office of Assistant President of the Church Hyrum served many missions for the Church During one mission traveling from Kirtland to Indiana he endured one of his greatest trials when his first wife Jerusha died soon after giving birth to his sixth child Hyrum s mother Lucy Mack Smith wrote that Jerusha s death wrung our hearts with more than common grief She was a woman whom everybody loved 6Although Hyrum was grieved his faith was unshaken his determination to serve Heavenly Father and his church never faltered I believe God rewarded his faithfulness by bringing into his life one of the great women of Church history Mary Fielding whom he subsequently married Together they built an extraordinary legacy of love and discipleship Clearly Hyrum Smith was one of the firm pillars of the Restoration But sadly many Church members know little about him except that he was martyred with his brother in Carthage Jail That is significant but he did far more Indeed Joseph Smith himself once suggested that his followers would do well to pattern their lives after Hyrum s 7 May I suggest a few examples from Hyrum s life that we may wish to follow In 1829 when Joseph was finishing the translation of the Book of Mormon Hyrum was anxious to begin spreading the gospel and building the Church He asked Joseph to inquire of the Lord what he should do In section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read the Lord s response Seek not to declare my word but first seek to obtain my word Study my word which hath gone forth and also study my word which is now translating 8Hyrum s life is a witness to his obedience to this instruction To the very last day of his life he devoted himself to obtaining the word through study of the scriptures In Carthage Jail he read and commented on extracts from the Book of Mormon The scriptures were obviously part of Hyrum s being and he turned to them during times when he needed comfort and strength the most Just think of the spiritual strength we could gain in our lives and how much more effective we would be as teachers missionaries and friends if we studied the scriptures regularly I am sure we like Hyrum will be able to endure our greatest trials if we search the word of God as he did The second great example from Hyrum s life that we may wish to follow occurred very early in the Restoration According to Lucy Mack Smith when young Joseph first told the rest of the family about his experience in the Sacred Grove Hyrum and all the others received the message joyfully The family sat in a circle giving the most profound attention to a boy who had never read the Bible through in his life 9 In contrast to the reaction of Laman and Lemuel to their younger brother Nephi s divine calling and to the jealousy of the older brothers of Joseph who was sold into Egypt there was no jealousy or animosity in Hyrum Smith Instead real faith was born in him of the simple and joyful response he felt to the spiritual truth of his brother s message The Lord let him know in his heart what was right and he followed Joseph faithfully for the rest of his life I the Lord love Hyrum the Savior revealed in section 124 of the Doctrine and Covenants because of the integrity of his heart and because he loveth that which is right before me 10Faithful Hyrum had a believing heart he did not have to see everything Joseph saw For him hearing the truth from Joseph s lips and feeling the spiritual promptings whispering that it was true were enough Faith to believe was the source of Hyrum s spiritual strength and is the source of the spiritual strength of faithful members of the Church then and today We do not need more members who question every detail we need members who have felt with their hearts who live close to the Spirit and who follow its promptings joyfully We need seeking hearts and minds that welcome gospel truths without argument or complaint and without requiring miraculous manifestation Oh how we are blessed when members respond joyfully to counsel from their bishops stake presidents quorum or auxiliary leaders some of whom might be younger than they and less experienced What great blessings we receive when we follow that which is right joyfully and not grudgingly The third example from the life of Hyrum was his selfless service to others His mother commented on this quality saying that he was rather remarkable for his tenderness and sympathy 11 When Joseph was afflicted with severe pain in his leg Hyrum relieved his mother and sat beside Joseph almost twenty four hours a day for more than a week Hyrum was the first to extend a hand of friendship to a visitor the first to attempt to moderate a dispute the first to forgive an enemy The Prophet Joseph was known to say that if Hyrum could not make peace between two who had fallen out the angels themselves might not hope to accomplish the task 12Do similar needs exist in the Church and in our families today Are we sensitive to the concerns of those who need special attention Are we aware of families who are struggling spiritually or emotionally and who need our love encouragement and support Hyrum s example of selfless service could be a powerful influence in the world today if enough of us choose to follow it Another great example comes to us from the dark dungeon of Liberty Jail Here Hyrum Joseph and a few others suffered exposure to cold hunger inhumane treatment and the loneliness of isolation from friends In this schoolhouse jail Hyrum learned the lesson of patience in adversity and affliction In the midst of this most severe trial his primary concern was not for himself and his companions but for his family In a letter to his wife Hyrum wrote that the greatest part of my trouble was wondering how she and the family were doing When I think of your trouble my heart is weighed down with sorrow But what can I do thy will be done O Lord 13As I travel throughout the Church I see members being tried in the crucible of affliction I see members suffering from debilitating health concerns I see husbands wives and parents living in trying circumstances they cannot change regarding their spouses or their children Every one of us is faced at times with unpleasant situations adversity and affliction that we cannot change Many circumstances can only be addressed with time tears prayer and faith For us like Hyrum peace may only come when we bring ourselves to say but what can I do thy will be done O Lord Surely Joseph was inspired when he wrote of his brother Hyrum Thy name shall be written for those who come after thee to look upon that they may pattern after thy works 14 May we help keep the promise made to Hyrum in section 124 of the Doctrine and Covenants that his name shall be had in honorable remembrance from generation to generation forever and ever 15 His name most certainly will be honorably revered as we follow his example and pattern after his works May the memory of Hyrum Smith and all of our faithful forefathers never fade from our minds I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Life s most challenging questions seem to be those that begin with the word why Why is life so hard Why is there so much sorrow hate and unhappiness in the world Why does death take the young And why must the innocent suffer We all have wrestled with such questions from time to time as we struggle with the vicissitudes of mortality I particularly want to talk to the younger members of God s family about why I believe the only satisfying answers to such questions come from the comforting perspective of faith in our Heavenly Father and his eternal plan for our happiness The prophet Alma called the plan the great plan of happiness Alma 42 8 It is known more commonly as the plan of salvation It is beautiful in its simplicity to all who seek prayerfully to know and understand the true meaning and purpose of life Through prophets past and present God has revealed the doctrines of his great plan of happiness It consists of infinite eternal absolute unchanging principles From Alma we learn that God gave unto them commandments after having made known the plan of redemption Alma 12 32 emphasis added The plan teaches that all who have or will live on earth are the spirit children of heavenly parents We lived with them before coming to this earth to receive our bodies of flesh and bone If Adam and Eve had not transgressed they would not have fallen but they would have remained in the garden of Eden And they would have had no children wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence having no joy Adam fell that men might be and men are that they might have joy 2 Ne 2 22 23 25 After the Fall God instructed Adam to cleave unto his wife Eve see Moses 3 24 D C 42 22 God said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth Gen 1 28 a commandment that has never been rescinded Our Father s plan provides for redemption from the Fall through the atonement of Jesus Christ As the Only Begotten Son of God and the only sinless person to live on this earth he made a perfect atonement for all mankind It applies to everyone unconditionally as it pertains to the resurrection from temporal or physical death for all shall rise from the dead with immortal bodies as a result of the Atonement However the Atonement is conditional as it pertains to each person s individual sins It touches everyone to the degree that he or she has faith in Jesus Christ repents and obeys the gospel Exaltation and eternal life with God are reserved for those who keep the commandments Mortality then is the time to test our ability to understand our Heavenly Father s plan and of course our willingness to be obedient Obedience is essential to obtain exaltation and eternal life King Benjamin explained that the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men to declare these things to every kindred nation and tongue that thereby whosoever should believe in Christ the same might receive remission of their sins and rejoice with exceedingly great joy Mosiah 3 13 He also taught his people Consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God For behold they are blessed in all things both temporal and spiritual and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never ending happiness Mosiah 2 41 What a wonderful warm and reassuring thing it is to know that the primary objective of the very God of heaven is the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 or in other words our eternal happiness and joy Sometimes I wonder if we really appreciate what that means and how it should affect our lives We must give adequate attention to the doctrines of happiness real happiness infinite and eternal They should be the objective of everything we teach in the Church and of everything we do The Prophet Joseph Smith said We cannot keep all the commandments without first knowing them and we cannot expect to know all or more than we now know unless we comply with or keep those we have already received Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith p 256 We must understand the basic doctrines and receive the saving ordinances that are essential for our eternal exaltation and happiness Our present mortal state places a veil of forgetfulness over our minds allowing us to prove ourselves able to do all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command Abr 3 25 But even though our present long range view of eternity is limited the Lord has not left us without direction He has provided scriptures and Apostles and prophets through whom he has revealed his plan for our exaltation and eternal life And we have the Comforter the Holy Ghost to guide us The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that in obedience there is joy and peace unspotted unalloyed and as God has designed our happiness he never has He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of his law and ordinances Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith pp 256 57 Critical to our knowledge of the plan of happiness is an understanding of the great governing principle of agency A person does not have to spend much time in the schoolroom of mortality to realize that Heavenly Father s plan does not provide for blissful happiness at every step along our mortal journey Life is filled with harsh realities that tug at the heart and tear away at the soul One cannot look at suffering regardless of its causes or origins without feeling pain and compassion I can understand why someone who lacks an eternal perspective might see the horrifying news footage of starving children and man s inhumanity to man and shake a fist at the heavens and cry If there is a God how could he allow such things to happen The answer is not easy but it isn t that complicated either God has put his plan in motion It proceeds through natural laws that are in fact God s laws Since they are his he is bound by them as are we I recognize for purposes we mortals may not understand the Lord can control the elements For the most part however he does not cause but he allows nature to run its course In this imperfect world bad things sometimes happen The earth s rocky underpinnings occasionally shift and move resulting in earthquakes Certain weather patterns cause hurricanes floods tornadoes and drought Much adversity is man made Men s hearts turn cold and the spirit of Satan controls their actions In foreseeing the day of suffering in our time the Savior said The love of men shall wax cold and iniquity shall abound D C 45 27 Violence immorality and other evils run rampant on the earth Much adversity has its origin in the principle of agency We tend to think of agency as a personal matter If we ask someone to define moral agency the answer will probably be something like this Moral agency means I am free to make choices for myself Often overlooked is the fact that choices have consequences we forget also that agency offers the same privilege of choice to others At times we will be affected adversely by the way other people choose to exercise their agency Our Heavenly Father feels so strongly about protecting our agency that he allows his children to exercise it either for good or for evil The plan of happiness is available to all of his children If the world would embrace and live it peace joy and plenty would abound on the earth Much of the suffering we know today would be eliminated if people throughout the world would understand and live the gospel We mortals have a limited view of life from the eternal perspective But if we know and understand Heavenly Father s plan we realize that dealing with adversity is one of the chief ways we are tested Our faith in our Heavenly Father and his beloved Son Jesus Christ is the source of inner strength Through faith we can find peace comfort and the courage to endure As we trust in God and his plan for our happiness with all our hearts and lean not unto our own understanding see Prov 3 5 hope is born Hope grows out of faith and gives meaning and purpose to all we do It can give us comfort in the face of adversity strength in times of trial and peace when we have reason for doubt or anguish By focusing on and living the principles of Heavenly Father s plan for our eternal happiness we can separate ourselves from the wickedness of the world If we are anchored to the correct understanding of who we are why we are here on this earth and where we can go after this mortal life Satan cannot threaten our happiness through any form of temptation If we are determined to live by Heavenly Father s plan we will use our God given moral agency to make decisions based on revealed truth not on the opinions of others or on the current thinking of the world For example we are moving into an era when the Information Superhighway will have the capacity to cut a wide path right into our homes With fiber optic computer technology it can link homes to an incredible assortment of messages and influences This highway will be the conduit of information that will have the power to change our culture and thus our very lives As we consider the importance of nourishing our intellects with the promising potential of Superhighway resources we must be ever cautious about the choices of programs and the impact of media in our lives Those who understand our Heavenly Father s eternal plan for the joy and happiness of his children will be better prepared to make good choices as the Information Superhighway rolls across the world The computer television satellite microchip and even the telephone all can bless and enhance our lives or can make them miserable This is why making life s decisions based on our Heavenly Father s plan is so important If we truly believe that we are his children and are here on earth to learn to live by faith the teachings and the commandments of God and his Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ we will make the choices that will qualify us to one day return to live in their presence Understanding the gospel of Jesus Christ and following him as our Savior and our Redeemer will influence every aspect of our lives including all of our individual choices Those who live according to Heavenly Father s eternal plan will not want to absorb any information that is illicit or untoward nor will they destroy their spiritual sensitivity through immoral acts or the consumption of any harmful substances Neither will they search for doctrinal loopholes to find reasons to challenge the ordained leadership of the Church nor tamper with the simple truths of the gospel They will not attempt to justify any lifestyle that is contrary to the plan of happiness If they do any of these things they will never find the inner peace and joy that living the gospel brings All of our Father s children can seek prayerfully to know who they are and can find real happiness if they obey God s commandments and endure to the end President Howard W Hunter said There is nothing sad or gloomy about a person who accepts the truths of the gospel and incorporates these principles in his daily living God wants all of his children to be joyous and glad and we can have this blessing if we are willing to keep his commandments and live by his word in all that we do in Conference Report Sept Oct 1961 p 108 When the plan of our Heavenly Father is understood the answers to life s questions are found in the gospel of Christ May we learn to accept with faith the doctrines and teachings of the gospel and accept the plan of salvation with believing hearts and minds Always know brothers and sisters that the leaders of the Church understand and accept the gospel plan and will defend it at all times and in all places My testimony coincides with the testimony of the beloved Apostle John If ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them John 13 17 May we search for the doctrines and commandments of the great plan of happiness and when we learn them may we embrace them willingly By doing so we will find lasting joy happiness and peace Jesus said Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid John 14 27 I leave you my testimony that the Lord s promise of peace comes from knowing and living the principles of our Heavenly Father s plan of happiness May his peace and joy be with all of us I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Three weeks ago I was assigned to host an open house at the Orlando Florida Temple for leaders representing the clergy press government education and business Before I escorted these prominent guests through the temple I explained to them the position and basic doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I wanted them to know why the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith so they could understand the divine purpose and the eternal significance of the temple My message this morning is to remind Church members what we have and to invite nonmembers to understand the need for the restoration of the gospel The mortal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ was comparatively brief He lived only thirty three years and His ministry was only three years But in those three years He taught the human family everything that is necessary to receive all of the blessings our Father in Heaven has in store for His children He concluded His mortal ministry with the single most compassionate and significant service in the history of the world the Atonement One of the most important accomplishments of the Savior was the establishment of His church upon the earth Paul taught that Christ gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers For the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ Eph 4 11 12 When Jesus called His twelve Apostles He laid His hands upon them ordained them and conferred upon them the authority to act in His name and govern His church Peter is commonly understood to have become the chief Apostle or the President of the Church after the death resurrection and ascension of Christ Early Christians endured the challenges of persecution and hardship Peter and his brethren had a difficult time holding the Church together and keeping the doctrine pure They traveled extensively and wrote to one another about the problems they were facing but information moved so slowly and the Church and its teachings were so new that heading off false teachings before they became firmly entrenched was difficult The New Testament indicates that the early Apostles worked hard to preserve the church that Jesus Christ left to their care and keeping but they knew their efforts would ultimately be in vain Paul wrote to the Thessalonian Saints who were anxiously anticipating the second coming of Christ that that day shall not come except there come a falling away first 2 Thes 2 3 He also warned Timothy that the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine And they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables 2 Tim 4 3 4 And Peter presupposed the falling away or the Apostasy when he spoke of the times of refreshing that would come before God would again send Jesus Christ who before was preached unto you Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began Acts 3 19 21 Eventually with the known exception of John the Beloved Peter and his fellow Apostles were martyred The Apostle John and members of the Church struggled for survival in the face of horrifying oppression To their everlasting credit Christianity did survive and was truly a prominent force by the end of the second century A D Many valiant Saints were instrumental in helping Christianity to endure Despite the significance of the ministries of these Saints they did not hold the same apostolic authority Peter and the other Apostles had received through ordination under the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself When that authority was lost men began looking to other sources for doctrinal understanding As a result many plain and precious truths were lost History tells us for example of a great council held in A D 325 in Nicaea By this time Christianity had emerged from the dank dungeons of Rome to become the state religion of the Roman Empire but the church still had problems chiefly the inability of Christians to agree among themselves on basic points of doctrine To resolve differences Emperor Constantine called together a group of Christian bishops to establish once and for all the official doctrines of the church Consensus did not come easily Opinions on such basic subjects as the nature of God were diverse and deeply felt and debate was spirited Decisions were not made by inspiration or revelation but by majority vote and some disagreeing factions split off and formed new churches Similar doctrinal councils were held later in A D 451 787 and 1545 with similarly divisive results The beautiful simplicity of Christ s gospel was under attack from an enemy that was even more destructive than the scourges and the crosses of early Rome the philosophical meanderings of uninspired men The doctrine became based more on popular opinion than on revelation This period of time was called the Dark Ages They were dark largely because the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had been lost Then in 1517 the Spirit moved Martin Luther a German priest who was disturbed at how far the church had strayed from the gospel as taught by Christ His work led to a reformation a movement that was taken up by such other visionaries as John Calvin Huldrych Zwingli John Wesley and John Smith I believe these reformers were inspired to create a religious climate in which God could restore lost truths and priesthood authority Similarly God inspired the earlier explorers and colonizers of America and the framers of the Constitution of the United States to develop a land and governing principles to which the gospel could be restored By 1820 the world was ready for the restitution of all things spoken of by Peter and all God s holy prophets since the world began Acts 3 21 At this time religious excitement was sweeping across the countryside in upstate New York Ministers from different denominations vied zealously for the loyalty of the faithful in villages and towns including Palmyra the home of the family of Joseph Smith Sr and Lucy Mack Smith The Smith family followed this religious excitement and members of the family were proselyted to various faiths Mother Smith and three of the children Hyrum Samuel and Sophronia joined one church see JS H 1 7 while Father Smith and his eldest son Alvin affiliated with another When fourteen year old Joseph Jr considered which church to join he investigated each denomination carefully listening to the respective ministers and trying to sort out the truth He knew there is one Lord one faith one baptism Eph 4 5 but which was the one he did not know In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions Joseph Smith Jr wrote later I often said to myself What is to be done Who of all these parties are right or are they all wrong together If any one of them be right which is it and how shall I know it JS H 1 10 Young Joseph looked for answers to his questions in the scriptures While reading in the Bible he came upon a simple direct admonition in the epistle of James If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him James 1 5 Joseph reflected Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart I reflected on it again and again knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God I did for how to act I did not know and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had I would never know JS H 1 12 With the simple faith of youth and motivated by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Joseph decided to go into a grove of trees near his home and put the promise in James to the test On a beautiful clear spring morning Joseph retired to the woods He paused when he arrived at a quiet secluded spot He looked around to make sure he was alone Then he knelt and began to pray No sooner had he done so than an overwhelming feeling of darkness swept over him as if some evil power was trying to dissuade him Rather than surrender Joseph intensified his pleas to God and God Himself responded Reading from Joseph s account I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head above the brightness of the sun which descended gradually until it fell upon me When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air One of them spake unto me calling me by name and said pointing to the other This is My Beloved Son Hear Him JS H 1 16 17 I testify those Beings were God our Heavenly Father and His resurrected Son Jesus Christ in one of the most supernal spiritual manifestations of all time They told Joseph he should join none of the existing churches Their mission accomplished the Father and His Son Jesus Christ departed leaving young Joseph physically drained but spiritually enriched with exciting restored truth He knew with certainty that God our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ are real for he had seen them He knew they are two separate distinct individuals He knew that no church on the face of the earth had the authority of the priesthood to act in the name of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Perhaps the most important lesson young Joseph learned in the Sacred Grove is this significant eternal truth the heavens are not sealed God does communicate with mortals He loves us today just as much as He loved those who lived anciently What comfort that sweet assurance provides in a world filled with confusion and discouragement What peace and security come to the heart that understands that God in heaven knows us and cares about us individually and collectively and that He communicates with us either directly or through His living prophets according to our needs My dear friends I testify to you that this is true and that the Father and the Son appeared in wondrous vision to young Joseph as a step in the restoring of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth Through subsequent equally miraculous experiences Joseph Smith was God s instrument in Translating from ancient records a book of scripture the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ Restoring priesthood authority Restoring sealing keys to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers Establishing the restored church of Jesus Christ in these latter days with the fulness of the gospel as taught in the meridian of time by the Savior and His Apostles Fulfilling biblical prophecy Preparing for the second coming of Jesus Christ During the Orlando temple tours I explained to our guests who were not of our faith that I understood if they found this message a bit overwhelming I taught my new friends in Orlando as I teach here this morning that either the gospel has been restored or it has not Either the Savior s original church and its doctrine were lost or they were not Either Joseph Smith had that remarkable vision or he did not The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ or it is not Either the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to earth through God s chosen latter day prophet or it was not The truth really is not any more complicated than that Either these things happened just as I have testified or they did not As a latter day Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ my testimony and the testimony of millions of faithful members of the Church the world over is that what I have told you this morning is true The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has been restored to the earth through Joseph Smith and is administered today by a living prophet These things I know This information is valuable to each of us only if we know for ourselves that it is true Thankfully we have a simple but certain way to know It requires some effort and sincere prayer But it is worth it In the last chapter of the Book of Mormon an ancient prophet named Moroni gave a significant promise to those who would one day read this sacred book of scripture His promise applies to every sincere seeker of truth He wrote And when ye shall receive these things I would exhort you that ye would ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ if these things are not true and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things Moro 10 4 5 Moroni urges us to go directly to the Source of Truth for answers to our questions If we seek Him humbly and sincerely He will help us discern truth from error As the Savior Himself assured His disciples Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free John 8 32 Brothers and sisters we know the truth Because we do we are expected to share it with all of our Heavenly Father s children To our dear friends of the Church please do not let pass this opportunity to receive personal revelation from God Consider what I have said Weigh it carefully Measure it against the things you believe Hold fast to all that is true and add to that the fulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Take into account what you have felt as you have listened You can know if these things are true by asking God Listen for His answer then respond to what you feel If you will do so I believe you will come to know as I know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is God s true church upon the earth May God bless you my dear friends with the peace and joy the gospel gives I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Before I was called as a General Authority I was in the automobile business as was my father before me Through the years I learned to appreciate the sound and the performance of a well tuned engine To me it is almost musical from the gentle purring of an idling motor to the vibrant roar of a throttle that is fully open The power that sound represents is even more exciting Nothing is quite the same as sitting behind the wheel of a fine automobile when the engine is operating at peak performance with the assembled parts working together in perfect harmony On the other hand nothing is more frustrating than a car engine that is not running properly No matter how beautiful the paint or comfortable the furnishings inside are a car with an engine that is not operating as it should is just a shell of unrealized potential An automobile engine will run on only a part of its cylinders but it never will go as far or as fast nor will the ride be as smooth as when it is tuned properly Unfortunately some wards in the Church are hitting on only a few cylinders including some that are trying to make do with just one The one cylinder ward is the ward where the bishop handles all of the problems makes all of the decisions and follows through on all of the assignments Then like an overworked cylinder in a car engine he is soon burned out Our bishops have heavy demands placed upon them They and they alone hold certain keys and only they can fulfill certain responsibilities But they are not called to be all things at all times to all people They are called to preside and to lead and to extend God s love to His children Our Heavenly Father does not expect them to do everything by themselves The same is true of our stake presidents priesthood quorum and auxiliary presidents and for that matter mothers and fathers All have stewardships that require large amounts of their time talent and energy But none is left to do it alone God the Master Organizer has inspired a creation of a system of committees and councils If understood and put to proper use this system will decrease the burden on all individual leaders and will extend the reach and the impact of their ministry through the combined help of others Six months ago I stood at this pulpit and talked about the importance of the council system in the Church I spoke about the great spiritual power and inspired direction that come from properly conducted family ward and stake councils The Spirit continues to bear witness to me of how vital efficiently run Church councils are to the accomplishment of the mission of the Church For that reason I have been anxious to see how well my remarks in October were understood particularly by our faithful and diligent bishops During training sessions I have conducted in various locations since last general conference I have focused attention on the ward council As part of that training I invited a ward council to participate I gave to the bishop a theoretical problem about a less active family and asked him to use the ward council to develop a plan to activate this family Without exception the bishop took charge of the situation immediately and said Here s the problem and here s what I think we should do to solve it Then he made assignments to the various ward council members This was a good exercise in delegation I suppose but it did not even begin to use the experience and wisdom of council members to address the problem Eventually I asked the bishop to try again only this time to solicit ideas and recommendations from his council members before making any assignments I especially encouraged him to ask the sisters for their ideas When the bishop opened the meeting to council members and invited them to counsel together the effect was like opening the floodgates of heaven A reservoir of insight and inspiration suddenly began to flow between council members as they planned for fellowshipping the less active family As I watched this same scenario played out before me time after time during the past six months I decided that it would not be out of order to speak about the importance of councils once again I speak not to scold those who did not give serious attention last time but because we have an urgent need in the Church for leaders particularly stake presidents and bishops to harness and channel spiritual power through councils Family ward and stake problems can be solved if we seek solutions in the Lord s way In my experience lives are blessed when leaders make wise use of committees and councils They move the work of the Lord forward much faster and farther like a fine automobile operating at peak efficiency Committee and council members are unified Together they experience a much more pleasant trip along the highway of Church service For my purpose today let me review three ward committees and councils that always should follow a prearranged agenda First is the priesthood executive committee It consists of the bishopric high priests group leader elders quorum president ward mission leader Young Men president ward executive secretary and ward clerk This committee meets weekly under the direction of the bishop to consider ward priesthood programs including temple and family history missionary welfare home teaching and member activation Second is the ward welfare committee It includes the priesthood executive committee plus the Relief Society presidency This committee meets at least monthly again under the direction of the bishop to consider the temporal needs of ward members Only the bishop may allocate welfare resources but the committee helps care for the poor by planning and coordinating the use of ward resources including the time talents skills materials and compassionate service of ward members In this and in other committee and council meetings delicate matters often are discussed requiring strict confidentiality The third is the ward council It includes the priesthood executive committee the presidents of the Relief Society Sunday School Young Women and Primary and the activities committee chairman The bishop may invite others to attend as needed This council meets at least monthly to correlate planning for all ward programs and activities and to review ward progress toward accomplishing the mission of the Church The ward council brings a varied group of priesthood and women leaders together to focus on the broad range of issues that affect ward members and the community The council reviews suggestions from home teachers and visiting teachers Recently a bishop who was concerned about reverence in his ward expressed his concern to the members of the ward council and asked for their suggestions Hesitantly the Primary president raised her hand Well she said one person consistently does a lot of enthusiastic visiting in the chapel just before and after sacrament meeting It can be pretty distracting The bishop had not noticed anyone being especially noisy in the chapel but he said he would talk to the offending party He asked the sister who it was She took a deep breath It s you Bishop she said I know you re just reaching out to people and we all appreciate your desire to greet everyone who comes to the meeting But when others see you moving around the chapel talking to people during the prelude music they figure it s OK for them to do the same thing When others in the ward council nodded in agreement the bishop thanked her and asked for recommendations The council soon decided that the bishopric including the bishop should be in their places on the stand five minutes before sacrament meeting to set an example of reverence in the chapel During a follow up discussion the council members indicated unanimously that the simple plan had worked and that reverence in sacrament meeting had improved decidedly Another bishop was concerned about the trend he noticed in ward fast and testimony meetings Members were bearing few testimonies of Christ and His gospel instead they were sermonizing giving travelogues sharing personal experiences that were not related to the gospel and talking about family outings and activities The bishop understood that those topics were important to the speakers But they were not testimonies of Christ and His gospel He asked the ward council How can we teach the importance of using testimony meeting for testifying of Christ and His restored church without offending our members After a little time and some comments by the sisters the council suggested that the bishop should teach the members what a testimony is and what it is not In addition the council concluded that the quorums and auxiliaries should discuss the purpose of testimony meeting and home teachers and visiting teachers should review this subject with individual families during their monthly visits The bishop now reports Our testimony meetings are much better The witness of Christ and His love for us is expressed by the members and the spirituality of our ward has improved greatly One major concern of the General Authorities is the lack of retention in full fellowship of some new converts and those who are less active in the Church If ward councils are functioning as they should every new convert will be fellowshipped will have home teachers or visiting teachers and will receive an appropriate calling within days after baptism The less active will receive callings that assure them that they are needed and loved by the ward members The Brethren also have expressed concern regarding Church members involvement in groups which are often very expensive that purport to increase self awareness raise self esteem and enhance individual agency Church leaders and members should not become involved in such groups Instead local leaders should counsel those desiring self improvement to anchor themselves in gospel principles and to adopt wholesome practices that strengthen one s ability to cope with challenges Bulletin 1993 2 Salt Lake City The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 1993 When stake presidents and bishops allow the priesthood and auxiliary leaders whom the Lord has called to serve with them to become part of a problem solving team wonderful things begin to happen Their participation broadens the base of experience and understanding leading to better solutions You bishops energize your ward leaders by giving them a chance to offer suggestions and to be heard You prepare future leaders by allowing them to participate and learn You can lift much of the load from your shoulders through this kind of involvement People who feel ownership of a problem are more willing to help find a solution greatly improving the possibility of success Once the appropriate councils are organized and the brethren and the sisters have full opportunity to contribute ward and stake leaders can move beyond just maintaining organizations They can focus their efforts on finding ways to make their world a better place to live Certainly ward councils can consider such subjects as gang violence child safety urban blight or community cleanup campaigns Bishops could ask ward councils How can we make a difference in our community Such broad thinking and participation in community improvement are the right things for Latter day Saints to do For the past eight and one half years I have served as a member of a council of twelve men We come from different backgrounds and we bring to the Council of the Twelve Apostles a diverse assortment of experiences in the Church and in the world In our meetings we do not just sit around and wait for President Howard W Hunter to tell us what to do We counsel openly with each other and we listen to each other with profound respect for the abilities and experiences our brethren bring to the council We discuss a wide variety of issues from Church administration to world events and we do so frankly and openly Sometimes we discuss issues for weeks before reaching a decision We do not always agree during our discussions But once a decision is made we are always both united and determined This is the miracle of Church councils listening to each other and listening to the Spirit When we support one another in Church councils we begin to understand how God can take ordinary men and women and make of them extraordinary leaders The best leaders are not those who work themselves to death trying to do everything single handedly the best leaders are those who follow God s plan and counsel with their councils Come now said the Lord in an earlier dispensation through the prophet Isaiah and let us reason together Isa 1 18 And in this dispensation He repeated that admonition Let us reason together that ye may understand D C 50 10 Let us remember that the basic council of the Church is the family council Fathers and mothers should apply diligently the principles I have discussed in their relationships with each other and with their children In doing so our homes can become a heaven on earth Brothers and sisters let us work together as never before in our stewardships to find ways to make more effective use of the wondrous power of councils I ask you to consider all that I said on this subject last October with what I have said today I testify that we can bring the full force of God s revealed plan for gospel governance into our ministries as we counsel together May God bless us to stand united as we strengthen the Church and our members I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Brethren have taught plain and precious truths about the gospel of Jesus Christ from this pulpit during this conference I bear testimony that we have heard the will of the Lord the mind of the Lord the word of the Lord the voice of the Lord and the power of God unto salvation D C 68 4 As the Lord Himself said in His preface to the Doctrine and Covenants What I the Lord have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not myself and though the heavens and the earth pass away my word shall not pass away but shall all be fulfilled whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same D C 1 38 We have missed the voices of President Benson President Hunter and Elder Ashton during this conference I seek the help of the Lord because I want to teach an important principle with the same spirit and clarity as my Brethren have taught God called a grand council in the premortal world to present His glorious plan for our eternal welfare The Lord s church is organized with councils at every level beginning with the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and extending to stake ward quorum auxiliary and family councils President Stephen L Richards said The genius of our Church government is government through councils I have had enough experience to know the value of councils Hardly a day passes but that I see God s wisdom in creating councils to govern his Kingdom I have no hesitancy in giving you the assurance if you will confer in council as you are expected to do God will give you solutions to the problems that confront you in Conference Report Oct 1953 p 86 As a member of the Twelve I serve on several general Church councils and committees I meet regularly with the leaders of the auxiliaries Together we counsel we search the scriptures and pray for guidance as we strive to learn how the auxiliaries can more effectively bless and strengthen the members of the Church In many respects general Church councils function much the same as stake and ward councils All councils in the Church should encourage free and open discussion by conferring with one another and striving to have clear concise communication Councils should discuss objectives and concerns with mutual understanding being the ultimate goal Stake and ward councils are ideal settings for leaders of all organizations to converse together and strengthen one another The primary focus of stake and ward council meetings should be coordinating activities and stewardship not calendaring In these meetings priesthood and auxiliary leaders should review together their responsibilities and find ways for Church programs to help members live the gospel in the home Today individuals and families need wise and inspired help from the Church to combat the evils of the world In a recent council meeting with the presidencies of the women s auxiliaries the sisters told me that very few women in the Church express any interest in wanting to hold the priesthood But they do want to be heard and valued and want to make meaningful contributions to the stake or ward and its members that will serve the Lord and help accomplish the mission of the Church For example not long ago we were talking about the worthiness of youth to serve missions President Elaine Jack said You know Elder Ballard the sisters of the Church may have some good suggestions on how to better prepare the youth for missions if they were just asked After all you know we are their mothers The sisters suggestions can help equally regarding temple attendance and a host of other matters with which priesthood leaders may be struggling Brethren please be sure you are seeking the vital input of the sisters in your council meetings Encourage all council members to share their suggestions and ideas about how the stake or ward can be more effective in proclaiming the gospel perfecting the Saints and redeeming the dead Ideally all members of any Church or any family council should share their concerns and should suggest solutions based on gospel principles I believe the Church and our families would be strengthened if stake presidents and bishops would use their council meetings for finding answers to questions on how to improve sacrament meetings how to improve reverence how to focus on children how to strengthen youth how to help singles including single parents how to teach and fellowship investigators and new members how to improve gospel teaching and many similar issues During the last half of this year we have been holding a special training meeting in conjunction with each stake conference to discuss the morality of our youth Those who have been participating are members of stake and ward councils Every question directed to me in the discussion period could be discussed most appropriately in a ward council meeting Yet rarely do those asking the questions feel that they have had an opportunity in ward council meetings to raise their questions voice their concerns and offer their suggestions In these perilous times we need the cooperative effort of men and women officers in the Church because absolute vigilance is required on the part of all who have been entrusted to help watch over the kingdom We each have large individual responsibilities but just as important is the responsibility we share with others to come together in council in a united effort to solve problems and bless all of our Church members When we act in a united effort we create spiritual synergism which is increased effectiveness or achievement as a result of combined action or cooperation the result of which is greater than the sum of the individual parts The ancient moralist Aesop used to illustrate the strength of synergism by holding up one stick and asking for a volunteer among his listeners who thought he could break it Of course the volunteer was able to break one stick easily Then Aesop would put more sticks together until the volunteer was unable to break them The moral to Aesop s demonstration was simple Together we generate synergism which makes us much stronger than when we stand alone God never intended that His children should stand alone Children have parents and parents have the Church with the scriptures living prophets and Apostles and the Holy Ghost to help them understand proper principles and act upon those principles in fulfilling their parental responsibilities The Apostle Paul taught that the Savior organized the Church complete with Apostles prophets and other officers and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ Till we all come in the unity of the faith Eph 4 12 13 Paul compared the members of the Church and their various responsibilities to the body For the body is not one member but many But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him But now are they many members yet but one body And the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you And whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it 1 Cor 12 14 18 20 21 26 The scriptures state clearly that while our respective callings may be different and may change from time to time all callings are important to the operation of the Church We need the priesthood quorums to assert themselves and fulfill their divinely mandated stewardship just as we need the Relief Society the Primary the Young Women the Sunday School and the activities committees to perform their vital functions And we need the officers and members of all of these inspired organizations to work together assisting each other as needed for the benefit of individuals and families This is not man s work nor woman s work it is all God s work which is centered on the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ I have some specific suggestions that if followed I believe can help us be more effective with our families and in our Church callings First focus on fundamentals We have certainly been taught about these fundamentals during this conference Those who teach must make sure the doctrine remains pure and that it is taught Teach by the Spirit using the scriptures and the approved curriculum Do not introduce or dwell on speculative and questionable topics Study the teachings of this conference in family home evenings and in family discussions they will strengthen your homes In a world that is filled with sin conflict and confusion we can find peace and safety in knowing and living the revealed truths of the gospel Second focus on people Coordination and calendaring have their time and place but too many council meetings begin and end there Rather than reciting a litany of organizational plans and reports spend most of the time in council meetings reviewing the needs of individual members In doing so confidentiality is critical Council members must hold all matters discussed in council meetings in strict confidence Third promote free and open expression Such expression is essential if we are to achieve the purpose of councils Leaders and parents should establish a climate that is conducive to openness where every person is important and every opinion valued The Lord admonished Let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings that when all have spoken that all may be edified D C 88 122 emphasis added Leaders should provide adequate time for council meetings and should remember that councils are for leaders to listen at least as much as they speak Fourth participation is a privilege With that privilege comes responsibility responsibility to work within the parameters of the organization to be prepared to share to advocate vigorously the position you believe to be right But just as important is the responsibility to support and sustain the final decision of the council leader even if you do not agree fully President David O McKay told of a meeting of the Council of the Twelve Apostles where a question of grave importance was discussed He and the other Apostles felt strongly about a certain course of action that should be taken and they were prepared to share their feelings in a meeting with the First Presidency To their surprise President Joseph F Smith did not ask for their opinion in the matter as was his custom Rather he arose and said This is what the Lord wants While it was not wholly in harmony with what he had decided President McKay wrote the President of the Twelve was the first on his feet to say Brethren I move that that becomes the opinion and judgment of this Council Second the motion said another and it was unanimous Six months did not pass before the wisdom of that leader was demonstrated Gospel Ideals Salt Lake City Improvement Era 1953 p 264 When a council leader reaches a decision the council members should sustain it wholeheartedly Fifth lead with love Jesus taught that the first and greatest commandment in the law is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself Matt 22 37 39 Priesthood leaders are to lead with persuasion long suffering gentleness and meekness love unfeigned kindness and pure knowledge D C 121 41 42 Those are the principles that should guide us in our relationships as neighbors in the church of Jesus Christ Those who hold the priesthood must never forget that they have no right to wield priesthood authority like a club over the heads of others in the family or in Church callings The Lord told Joseph Smith that when we undertake to cover our sins or to gratify our pride our vain ambition or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men in any degree of unrighteousness behold the heavens withdraw themselves the Spirit of the Lord is grieved and when it is withdrawn Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man D C 121 37 In other words any man who claims the special powers of heaven for his own selfish purposes and seeks to use the priesthood in any degree of unrighteousness in the Church or in the home simply does not understand the nature of his authority Priesthood is for service not servitude compassion not compulsion caring not control Those who think otherwise are operating outside the parameters of priesthood authority Thankfully most of our fathers and priesthood officers lead with love just as most of our mothers and auxiliary leaders do Leadership based on love brings incredible power It is real and it generates lasting results in the lives of our Father s children May God bless you brothers and sisters to find inspired consensus and unity as you counsel together in your service one to another Only in so doing can the Church and our families begin to approach their full potential for doing good among the children of God on earth I know God lives and Jesus is the Christ I know we can accomplish their work better through unity and love as we sit in council one with another May we be blessed to so do is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I am honored to speak to you sisters of the Relief Society Each one of you is a part of the largest and oldest women s organization in the world and the only one organized by a prophet of God I bring you greetings from the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles We and your local priesthood leaders value you sisters and hold you in high esteem We recognize and appreciate all you do to help build the kingdom of God We marvel at your faith and your dedicated service to your families the Church and your communities We pray for you and we extend our love to each one of you My brethren and I serve as priesthood advisers to the Relief Society general presidency and board The task of Relief Society is more challenging than ever because of the diversity of languages cultures and environments and the ever changing circumstances throughout the world Careful planning has to be both broad and narrow broad enough to meet the varying needs of more than three million women living in more than 130 different countries and locations and yet narrow enough to meet the needs of each sister Relief Society and the gospel should embrace every woman Every one of you is welcome and needed whether you are eighteen or eighty married or single speak English or Portuguese live on an island or in the mountains have children or simply love children but have none of your own have an advanced degree or little formal education have a husband who is not active or are married to a stake president have a testimony or are struggling to receive one You belong here You and your talents strengths and contributions are needed urgently in the Church As Eliza R Snow the second general president of the Relief Society said There is no sister so isolated and her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the kingdom of God upon the earth Woman s Exponent 15 Sept 1893 p 62 I pray for the Spirit of the Lord this evening as I teach a fundamental principle of the gospel that if understood will fortify and bless you sisters in your quest for eternal life Our Father in Heaven loves all of His children equally perfectly and infinitely His love is no different for His daughters than for His sons Our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ also loves men and women equally His atonement and His gospel are for all of God s children During His earthly ministry Jesus served men and women alike He healed both men and women and He taught both men and women The gospel of Jesus Christ can sanctify both men and women in the same way and by identical principles For example faith repentance baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost are requirements for all of God s children regardless of gender The same is true of temple covenants and blessings Our Father s work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children see Moses 1 39 He loves us all equally and His greatest gift the gift of eternal life is available to all Even though men and women are equal before God in their eternal opportunities they have different but equally significant duties in His eternal plan We must understand that God views all of His children with infinite wisdom and perfect fairness Consequently He can acknowledge and even encourage our differences while providing equal opportunity for growth and development Our Heavenly Father assigned different responsibilities in mortality to men and women when we lived with Him as His spirit sons and daughters To His sons He would give the priesthood and the responsibilities of fatherhood and to His daughters He gave the responsibilities of motherhood each with its attendant functions The creation of the world the atonement of Jesus Christ and the restoration of the gospel in the latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith all have one unifying purpose to allow all of the spirit children of our Eternal Father to obtain mortal bodies and then through the gift of moral agency to follow the plan of redemption made possible by the Savior s atonement God prepared all of this for us that we might return to our heavenly home clothed in immortality and eternal life to live with Him as families A family can live with Him only after a man and a woman are sealed in marriage for eternity by the power of the holy priesthood We acknowledge that many in the Church desire this great blessing but see little evidence of its fulfillment in this life Nevertheless the promise of exaltation remains an attainable goal for each one of us The prophets have stated clearly that no blessing will be withheld from any of God s sons and daughters if they love Him have faith in Him keep His commandments and endure faithfully to the end Most of what men and women must do to qualify for an exalted family life together is based on shared responsibilities and objectives Many of the requirements are exactly the same for men and women For example obedience to the laws of God should be the same for men and women Men and women should pray in the same way They both have the same privilege of receiving answers to their prayers and thereby obtaining personal revelation for their own spiritual development Both men and women are to serve their families and others but the specific ways in which they do so are sometimes different For example God has revealed through his prophets that men are to receive the priesthood become fathers and with gentleness and pure unfeigned love they are to lead and nurture their families in righteousness as the Savior leads the Church see Eph 5 23 They have been given the primary responsibility for the temporal and physical needs of the family see D C 83 2 Women have the power to bring children into the world and have been given the primary duty and opportunity as mothers to lead nurture and teach them in a loving spiritual environment In this divine partnership husbands and wives support one another in their God given capacities By appointing different accountabilities to men and women Heavenly Father provides the greatest opportunity for growth service and progress He did not give different tasks to men and women simply to perpetuate the idea of a family rather He did so to ensure that the family can continue forever the ultimate goal of our Heavenly Father s eternal plan We need to recognize the hard mortal realities in all of this and must use common sense and guidance by personal revelation Some will not marry in this life Some marriages will fail Some will not have children Some children will choose not to respond to even the most devoted and careful nurturing by loving parents In some cases health and faith may falter Some who would rather remain at home may have to work Let us not judge others because we do not know their situation nor do we know what common sense and personal revelation have led them to do We do know that throughout mortality women and men will face challenges and tests of their commitment to God s plan for them We need to remember that trials and temptations are an important part of our lives We should not criticize others for the way they choose to exercise their moral agency when faced with adversity or affliction In these latter days we see people increasing in number who urge others to feel and voice dissent when frustration and hardship enter their lives They would have us believe that the Church or its leaders are unfair to women or that women are denied opportunities to realize their full potential within the gospel framework Sisters we know that the Church is made up of mortals that priesthood leaders are fallible and some may not always handle their stewardships with suitable sensitivity However I want you to understand this plain truth the gospel of Jesus Christ provides the only way for women or men to achieve their full potential as children of God Only the gospel can free us from the terrible effects of sin Only by following God s plan for us with faith and determination to live ultimately in eternal families can we qualify for eternal life in His presence Ideally the Church and the family do not inhibit our progress They expedite it by putting our feet firmly on the gospel path that leads us back to God We each have the privilege to carefully and prayerfully seek the Lord s will for us regarding our individual challenges and dilemmas Personal revelation is personal indeed It is not based on gender or position but on worthiness It comes in response to sincere inquiry However revelation for the Church comes only through the Lord s prophets seers and revelators In these confusing times keeping our feet on the gospel path can be difficult We hear many persuasive voices urging us to turn our backs on revealed truth and embrace the philosophies of the world I offer three simple suggestions that will help us all to keep our eternal perspective clear and unimpaired First focus on fundamentals With so much depth and substance in the simple truths of the gospel you never need to wade in the shallow waters of speculative theology Teach one another in Relief Society and in your visiting teaching the pure doctrines found in the scriptures and in the approved curriculum the Holy Ghost will guide and affirm your teaching Teach your children faith repentance baptism and the other basic principles of the restored gospel Make your covenants with God and receive all of the priesthood ordinances Study and ponder the scriptures especially the Book of Mormon individually and as families In a world filled with conflict and confusion you will find peace and safety in the revealed word of God Second maintain balance Free and open doctrinal discussion is important in gospel scholarship but remember that most things have been put into place by God and simply are not subject to change The doctrines and principles of the Church are established only through revelation not legislation This is God s plan we do not have the prerogative to alter or tamper with it Our task is to integrate the principles of the gospel into our lives so that our lives will be in balance When our lives are in balance before you realize it your life will be full of spiritual understanding that will confirm that your Heavenly Father loves you and that His plan is fair and true and we should strive to understand it and enjoy living it Third reach out to one another with love for charity never faileth Moro 7 46 Many of your sisters including some who are here tonight may be hurting for one reason or another Reach out to those who suffer listen to their concerns be worthy of their trust and always keep their confidences Share their burdens Teach them both by precept and by example about Heavenly Father s plan for His children Help them understand our Father s unalterable commitment to the principle of moral agency Teach them about the essential part adversity plays in our eternal lives Take them by the hand and help them to repent forgive have faith endure or do whatever is needed Never forget that the Lord may work a miracle in their lives through you Sisters you belong to Relief Society It is organized under priesthood direction in every ward and branch The members of your local Relief Society presidency are wise inspired women who have been called by revelation and set apart by those who hold the authority to administer the ordinances of the gospel I have served twice as a bishop and I want you to know that you are part of an organization that is vital to your ward and that your individual contributions are of great value to the work of the Lord May God bless you my dear sisters in your personal lives in your homes and families and in your Church callings May He bless you for your faithful service May you feel the comforting assurance that your Heavenly Father loves each one of you His daughters and that the way He marks for you is the way to perfect fairness and freedom in this life and in eternity To this I testify and humbly pray for the Lord s blessings to be with you in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
This morning I want to speak primarily to the young men and young women of the Church I pray for the Spirit to help me inspire you young people to want to live righteous lives Some of you may not understand our Heavenly Father s plan well enough to appreciate how important living a morally clean life is if you want to enjoy peace happiness and self esteem When you understand the truths of the gospel will give you the guidance you need to be worthy members of the Church When you accept the basic principles of the gospel and commit to live them you will have the spiritual insight that will help you to be young men and women of purity integrity and faith Unfortunately we live in a world that is awash in all kinds of moral pollution including drugs violence filthy language pornography in literature and videotapes films and television shows that promote illicit sex and promiscuity as being normal A national debate is raging to make elective abortion acceptable With challenges like these you need to remember that you do not face them alone There are people who love you and want you to be happy We want the very best for you Most especially your Father in Heaven loves you and wants you to have joy and happiness He has made marvelous promises to His faithful children who love Him who are baptized and who keep His commandments When you entered the waters of baptism you made a promise to the Lord that you would humble yourselves before God and witness before the church that you have truly repented of all your sins and are willing to take upon yourselves the name of Jesus Christ having a determination to serve him to the end and truly manifest by your works that you have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of your sins D C 20 37 You were therefore bound by covenant to a godly walk and conversation walking in holiness before the Lord D C 20 69 Many of you were baptized when you were eight years old and you may not realize that this is the promise you made to your Heavenly Father when you were baptized Always remember that you are under this covenant Your Heavenly Father has promised in return that He will give marvelous blessings to those who honor their covenants keep His commandments and endure faithfully to the end They will be sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise and will be given all things D C 76 55 emphasis added see also D C 76 50 54 70 including an inheritance in the celestial kingdom see 2 Ne 31 16 20 The Apostle Paul wrote that eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 1 Cor 2 9 Those who live clean lives and keep the commandments shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever D C 76 62 They shall have eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God D C 14 7 I remind you young men who have been ordained to the priesthood that you have made an additional covenant with God When you were ordained you made a sacred promise with the Lord that you would honor your priesthood faithfully See D C 84 33 42 We are pleased to know that many of you are true and faithful in every way to your priesthood covenants and are preparing yourselves to receive the Lord s promised blessings Unfortunately we know also that too many young men of the priesthood pay little attention to the serious nature of their sacred promises made with Heavenly Father Let me explain why you young men and women must keep your covenants you have made with God In the premortal world before we left the presence of Heavenly Father He warned and cautioned us about new experiences we would have in mortality We knew that we would have a physical body of flesh and bone Never having been mortal before we had no experience dealing with the temptations of mortality But Heavenly Father knew and understood He charged us to control our mortal bodies and to make them subject to our spirits Our spirits would have to master the physical temptations that our bodies would encounter in a temporal world Spiritual power over the influence of Satan comes to us by keeping the commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ Being here on earth for the first time in our eternal existence we are away from the protective presence of our Father in Heaven and are subject to the influence of Satan and his followers Remember that Satan even tried to tempt the Savior into betraying the promises He had made to God After Jesus was baptized He went into the wilderness to fast and pray for forty days Satan chose that moment during Christ s hunger and physical weakness to tempt Him But Jesus did not succumb He stood firm Satan will seek to tempt us at times and in ways that exploit our greatest weaknesses or destroy our strengths But his promises of pleasure are short lived deceptions His evil design is to tempt us into sinning knowing that when we sin we separate ourselves from our Heavenly Father and the Savior Jesus Christ We begin to move away from Heavenly Father s promised blessings toward the misery and anguish in which Satan and his followers languish By sinning we put ourselves in Satan s power Now my dear young friends I understand the struggles you face every day in keeping the commandments of the Lord The battle for your souls is increasingly fierce The adversary is strong and cunning However you have within your physical body the powerful spirit of a son or daughter of God Because He loves you and wants you to come home to Him our Father in Heaven has given you a conscience that tells your spirit when you are keeping the Lord s commandments and when you are not If you will pay more attention to your spiritual self which is eternal than to your mortal self which is temporary you can always resist the temptations of Satan and conquer his efforts to take you into his power You must be honest with yourself and remain true to the covenants you have made with God Do not fall into the trap of thinking you can sin a little and it will not matter Remember the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance D C 1 31 Some young men and women in the Church talk openly about sexual transgression They seem to forget that the Lord forbids all sexual relations before marriage including petting sex perversion of any kind or preoccupation with sex in thought speech or action Some youth foolishly rationalize that it is no big deal to sin now because they can always repent later when they want to go to the temple or on a mission Anyone who does that is breaking promises made to God both in the premortal life and in the waters of baptism The idea of sinning a little is self deception Sin is sin Sin weakens you spiritually and it always places the sinner at eternal risk Choosing to sin even with the intent to repent is simply turning away from God and violating covenants Gratefully many of you young men honor your priesthood and many young women stand for truth and righteousness as stated in the Young Women s motto Young Women Leadership Handbook Salt Lake City The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 1992 p 5 We commend you for your fidelity and integrity For those who have strayed the Savior has provided a way back But it is not without pain Repentance is not easy it takes time painful time You deceive yourself if you believe you can break the promises you have made with Heavenly Father and suffer no consequence You sustain the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets seers and revelators We prepared for you a pamphlet entitled For the Strength of Youth Salt Lake City The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 1990 Most of you know that this inspired pamphlet contains guidelines to help you measure your moral conduct I urge you to read every word over and over again so you will understand what the Lord and His church expect of you The First Presidency message is so important that I will quote a few statements from it Our beloved young men and women We want you to know that we love you We have great confidence in you Because of that we talk to you frankly and honestly God loves you as He loves each and every one of His children His desire purpose and glory is to have you return to Him pure and undefiled having proven yourselves worthy of an eternity of joy in His presence We counsel you to choose to live a morally clean life The prophet Alma declared Wickedness never was happiness Alma 41 10 Truer words were never spoken You cannot do wrong and feel right It is impossible We pray that you the young and rising generation will keep your bodies and minds clean free from the contaminations of the world that you will be fit and pure vessels to bear triumphantly the responsibilities of the kingdom of God in preparation for the second coming of our Savior Pp 3 5 Please make sure you have a copy of the pamphlet For the Strength of Youth and regularly read it Carry the small wallet sized summary card with you Read carefully the section in the pamphlet that teaches principles of sexual purity and follow the counsel with exactness Those of you who have been unwise and have transgressed should read and pray about the section on repentance This is also very important so I will quote a few statements from this section Some people knowingly break God s commandments They plan to repent before they go on a mission or receive the sacred covenants and ordinances of the temple Repentance for such behavior is difficult and painful and may take a long time It is better to not commit the sin Certain sins are of such gravity that they can put your membership in the Church and your eternal life at risk Sexual sins are among those of such seriousness Where choices have already led to sexual impurity repentance is the way back Talk to your parents and your bishop They love you and will explain to you how to repent and put your life in order again Follow their counsel The miracle of forgiveness is real and true repentance is accepted by the Lord Full repentance of some sins requires that we not only confess and resolve them with the Lord but that we also do so with the Church The bishop and stake president have been appointed by revelation to serve as judges in these cases Only the Lord can forgive sins but these priesthood leaders can assist the transgressor in the process of repentance If you have sinned the sooner you begin to make your way back the sooner you will find the sweet peace and joy that come with the miracle of forgiveness Stake and mission presidents and bishops and branch presidents recently received instructions from the First Presidency on recommending worthy and qualified members for full time missionary service Brethren we expect that you will teach youth leaders parents and the youth these long established principles Missionaries must be morally clean and spiritually prepared by you to serve the Lord in today s world I urge you to follow the instructions precisely and to do all in your power to help young people avoid any sin that could disqualify them for service in the kingdom of God Now my dear young friends I encourage you to take time each week to be by yourself away from television and the crowd Have your scriptures with you and as you read ponder and pray take an honest look at your life Evaluate where you stand with the promises you have made with Heavenly Father If you have a problem talk it over with the Lord in earnest and humble prayer Counsel with your parents they will help you Your bishop and your Young Men and Young Women adult leaders will help They love you and want you to be at peace with yourself so you can partake of the sacrament worthily each week When all is said and done however only you know if you are living true to your covenants made with God You will be grateful when the day comes for you to attend the temple that you followed the counsel of the Lord and chose to be morally clean May God bless each of you young men and women with a pure heart and a sincere desire to serve the Lord worthily I know this Church is true I know God lives and Jesus is the Christ I know that if you the youth of the Church will have the courage to keep your covenants and follow the counsel of your parents and Church leaders you will have the desire and the strength to live worthy lives You then will be prepared for your responsibilities in your homes in the Church and in your communities and will be prepared to return to your Heavenly Father May God bless every one of our precious youth I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Living in these difficult times brothers and sisters requires each one of us to maintain a positive hopeful perspective about the future Today more so than in the past I am asked about the signs of the times and if I think the end of the world is near My answer is the same one that Jesus gave some two thousand years ago But of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the Son but the Father Take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is Mark 13 32 33 When Jesus was asked about the sign of His coming he said Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places All these are the beginning of sorrows Matt 24 6 8 emphasis added Although the prophecies tell us that these things are to take place more and more people are expressing great alarm at what appears to be an acceleration of worldwide calamity As members of the Church we must not forget the Savior s admonition Be not troubled for all these things must come to pass These are difficult times when the forces of nature seem to be unleashing a flood of famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places Recently I read a newspaper article that cited statistics from the U S Geological Survey indicating that earthquakes around the world are increasing in frequency and intensity According to the article only two major earthquakes earthquakes measuring at least six on the Richter scale occurred during the 1920s In the 1930s the number increased to five and then it decreased to four during the 1940s But in the 1950s nine major earthquakes occurred followed by fifteen during the 1960s forty six during the 1970s and fifty two during the 1980s Already almost as many major earthquakes have occurred during the 1990s as during the entire decade of the 1980s The world is experiencing violent disorders both physical as well as social Here in the United States we are still reeling from two incredibly destructive hurricanes People in the Philippines see no end to the devastation of the volcanic eruption of Mt Pinatubo Famine grips portions of Africa where tragic human suffering is prevalent To a lesser degree hunger afflicts millions even in countries that have a high standard of living Political unrest warfare and economic chaos prevail in many parts of the world and the plagues of pornography drug misuse immorality AIDS and child abuse become more oppressive with each passing day The media busily satisfies an apparently insatiable appetite of audiences to witness murder violence nudity sex and profanity Is not this the day of which Moroni spoke when he recorded Behold I speak unto you as if ye were present and yet ye are not But behold Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me and I know your doing Morm 8 35 And then he prophesied of conditions of the world as they are today Brothers and sisters whether or not these are indeed the last days or even the beginning of sorrows as the Savior foretold some of us may find our lives laden with frustration disappointment and sorrow Many feel helpless to deal with the chaos that seems to prevail in the world Others anguish over family members who are being carried downstream in a swift raging current of weakening values and declining moral standards Children particularly are suffering as society drifts further and further away from the commandments of God Many have even resigned themselves to accept the wickedness and cruelty of the world as being irreparable They have given up hope They have decided to quit trying to make the world a better place in which they and their families can live They have surrendered to despair Admittedly we have ample reason to be deeply concerned because we see no immediate answers to the seemingly unsolvable problems confronting the human family But regardless of this dark picture which will ultimately get worse we must never allow ourselves to give up hope Moroni having seen our day counseled Wherefore there must be faith and if there must be faith there must also be hope Moro 10 20 To all who have harbored feelings of despair and an absence of hope I offer the words of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith Fear not little flock do good let earth and hell combine against you for if ye are built upon my rock they cannot prevail Look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not D C 6 34 36 even so am I in the midst of you D C 6 32 My message to you today my brothers and sisters is simply this the Lord is in control He knows the end from the beginning He has given us adequate instruction that if followed will see us safely through any crisis His purposes will be fulfilled and someday we will understand the eternal reasons for all of these events Therefore today we must be careful to not overreact nor should we be caught up in extreme preparations but what we must do is keep the commandments of God and never lose hope But where do we find hope in the midst of such turmoil and catastrophe Quite simply our one hope for spiritual safety during these turbulent times is to turn our minds and our hearts to Jesus Christ The prophet Mormon taught Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection to be raised unto life eternal and this because of your faith in him according to the promise Wherefore if a man have faith he must needs have hope for without faith there cannot be any hope Moro 7 41 42 Faith in God and in His Son Jesus Christ is absolutely essential for us to maintain a balanced perspective through times of trial and difficulty Remember nothing will occur in our lives that He does not understand Alma taught And he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people Alma 7 11 Please turn to Him if you are discouraged and struggling for direction in your life Armed with the shield of faith we can overcome many of our daily challenges and overpower our greatest weaknesses and fears knowing that if we do our best to keep the commandments of God come what may we will be all right Of course that does not necessarily mean that we will be spared personal suffering and heartache Righteousness has never precluded adversity But faith in the Lord Jesus Christ real faith whole souled and unshakable is a power to be reckoned with in the universe It can be a causative force through which miracles are wrought Or it can be a source of inner strength through which we find peace comfort and the courage to cope As we put our faith and trust to work hope is born Hope grows out of faith and gives meaning and purpose to all that we do It can even give us the peaceful assurance we need to live happily in a world that is ripe with iniquity calamity and injustice As the end of the Savior s mortal ministry drew near He offered this reassuring hope to His beloved disciples Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid John 14 27 Hope is a precious principle by which to live However some among us may have lost all hope because of sin and transgression A person can become so deeply immersed in the ways of the world that he sees no way out and loses all hope My plea to all who have fallen into this trap of the adversary is to never give up Regardless of how desperate things may seem or how desperate they may yet become please believe me you can always have hope Always Recently I had the privilege of performing the temple sealing ordinances for a wonderful family It was a beautiful occasion as such ceremonies almost always are But if you had known the father of this family several years earlier you would have understood what a miracle was taking place in the House of the Lord that day With his permission I quote from a letter he wrote to me I was born into the Church and was taught the gospel at my mother s knee Through her diligence and perseverance she kindled a small ember of testimony that never left me even through some of the roughest times of my life In my teen years Satan hit me hard It was during the late 1960s and early 1970s a time of great turmoil and Satan was hard at work on me I was taken with the practice of free drugs free love free fun and the rest of the world be damned Beginning with my first drink of alcohol I began to slowly deteriorate After alcohol other drugs were that much easier to use In order to take drugs you must become a good liar You learn to do whatever it takes to conceal your behavior from others After many years of living this way all my moral fiber seemed to be completely eroded away I had a minimal amount of conscience and had sunk to the depths of despair and depression I watched friends die from drugs and suicide As time passed my friends and I were exposed to the criminal justice system In fact many of my former friends are still in prison Had it not been for the small flicker of testimony instilled in me by my mother when I was a child to know that Heavenly Father could still love me I have reservations as to whether I would even be writing this letter today Some parents might have given up hope on this prodigal son but not this man s mother She continued to believe that he would find his way back to the teachings of his childhood and once again place his trust in the Lord Jesus Christ With the loving support of his family and friends that is exactly what he did Let me read again from his letter If there is one thing I have learned it is that no matter how lost you feel no matter how low you may have sunk there can be forgiveness and peace I learned that the further one drifts from the Lord the harder it is to return to Him and His teachings But once I opened my heart and called out in prayer to Heavenly Father to help me in the name of His Son Jesus Christ I came to know the power of repentance and the blessings of obedience to God s commandments Brothers and sisters I wish all of you could have been with us in the temple that day to feel the joy of hope fulfilled I am sure you would have sensed as I did the rekindled love for God and the sublime happiness that filled the heart of my friend s mother as her four sons their companions and other family members surrounded her in the sealing room The Apostle Paul taught that three divine principles form a foundation upon which we can build the structure of our lives They are faith hope and charity See 1 Cor 13 13 Together they give us a base of support like the legs of a three legged stool Each principle is significant within itself but each also plays an important supporting role Each is incomplete without the others Hope helps faith develop Likewise true faith gives birth to hope When we begin to lose hope we are faltering also in our measure of faith The principles of faith and hope working together must be accompanied by charity which is the greatest of all According to Mormon charity is the pure love of Christ and it endureth forever Moro 7 47 It is the perfect manifestation of our faith and hope Working together these three eternal principles will help give us the broad eternal perspective we need to face life s toughest challenges including the prophesied ordeals of the last days Real faith fosters hope for the future it allows us to look beyond ourselves and our present cares Fortified by hope we are moved to demonstrate the pure love of Christ through daily acts of obedience and Christian service I assure you my brothers and sisters that our Heavenly Father is aware of us individually and collectively He understands the spiritual physical and emotional difficulties we face in the world today In fact they are all part of His plan for our eternal growth and development And His promise to us is sure He that endureth in faith and doeth my will the same shall overcome D C 63 20 The Savior promised that no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord 3 Ne 22 17 May we all find the peace of God which passeth all understanding Philip 4 7 which can be found only through charity faith and hope May I leave you my testimony that I know that the Lord Jesus Christ lives He has restored His Church to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith Our assurance of eternal life rests in our love of God and the keeping of His commandments This knowledge gives me hope and faith May it be so with each of you I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Last October we listened to many inspired conference messages In his Sunday morning address President Gordon B Hinckley called to our attention some of the poignant experiences of our pioneer forefathers whose sacrifices helped them lay the foundation of the restored Church Our hearts were softened and our spirits grew tender with emotion as we listened to him recount experiences of some of those hardy handcart pioneers The images engendered in my mind and heart have not left me Again and again I find my thoughts returning to the high snow covered windswept plains of Wyoming In my mind s eye I see the suffering of those faithful Saints and know that in their extremity under circumstances hard for us today to conceive many of them came to know God in a way that few people will ever understand Many of us are descendants of hardy pioneers and we feel grateful and inspired by their faith promoting examples of sacrifice My great grandmother Margaret McNeil Ballard recorded in her journal a pioneer experience of sacrifice that occurred when she was between nine and eleven years of age She wrote After landing we planned to go west to Utah with the Martin and Willey handcart companies but Elder Franklin D Richards counseled my father not to go with them Afterwards we were very thankful because of the great suffering privation and cold weather to which these people were subjected There were many of the company who were frozen that year on their journey The company we were assigned to had gone on ahead and as my mother was anxious for me to go with them she strapped my little brother James on my back with a shawl He was only four years old and quite sick with the measles but I took him since my mother had all she could do to care for the other children I hurried and caught up with the company traveling with them all day That night a kind lady helped me take my brother off my back I sat up and held him on my lap with the shawl wrapped around him alone all night He was a little better in the morning The people in the camp were very good to us and gave us a little fried bacon and some bread for breakfast We traveled this way for about a week before my brother and I were united with our family again This brief episode in Great grandmother s life teaches me that our pioneer ancestors gave everything even their lives for their faith for the building of the kingdom of God when the Church was in its infancy It teaches also that they helped nourished and strengthened each other in their extremity and shared unstintingly Their material means such as food clothing and shelter were meager but their love for one another and their devotion to their Lord and to the gospel were boundless Our commitment to the kingdom should match that of our faithful ancestors even though our sacrifices are different They were driven from comfortable homes and compelled to journey one thousand miles by ox drawn wagon and handcart to reestablish their families homes and Church in safety Our sacrifices may be more subtle but no less demanding Instead of physical deprivation and hardship we face the challenge of remaining true and faithful to gospel principles amidst such evil and destructive forces as dishonesty corruption drug and alcohol misuse and disease often caused by sexual promiscuity Also we find ourselves in combat daily with immorality in all of its many forms Pornography and violence often portrayed in insidious television shows movies and videos are running rampant Hate and envy greed and selfishness are all about us and families are disintegrating at an ever increasing pace In the midst of all of this my brothers and sisters we must never forget the source of our abundant blessings I recall in my own ministry joining with members of the Holladay Seventh Ward in the spring of 1956 as we gathered on the hillside near Mount Olympus Under the direction of our stake president G Carlos Smith we broke ground for the construction of a new ward building At the time the ward was created we had a total of 373 members As I recall more than half of them were under the age of twelve I served as second counselor to Bishop William Partridge Under his leadership this little band of people proceeded immediately to build a three phase ward building The ward was divided in 1958 and I was named bishop of the Holladay Twelfth Ward In those days local members paid 50 percent of the cost of constructing a building One of the most important leadership experiences in my life came several weeks before the announced dedication of the building Our ward of young families who were struggling to make ends meet needed to raise the final 30 000 required to pay our share of the cost I fasted and prayed asking for help from Heavenly Father to know what I should say to our ward members regarding this obligation We already had pressed them very hard and they had willingly contributed money and personal labor beyond anything I believed possible But still we needed to raise the last 30 000 As the brethren gathered for priesthood meeting I was impressed to read to them the testimony my Grandfather Ballard bore to the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve on January 7 1919 the day he was ordained an Apostle I quote just a small portion of his testimony I know as I know that I live that this is God s work and that you are His servants I remember one testimony among the many testimonies which I have received Two years ago about this time I had been on the Fort Peck Reservation for several days with the brethren solving the problems connected with our work among the Lamanites Many questions arose that we had to settle There was no precedent for us to follow and we just had to go to the Lord and tell Him our troubles and get inspiration and help from Him On this occasion I had sought the Lord under such circumstances and that night I received a wonderful manifestation and impression which has never left me I was carried to this place into this room I saw myself here with you I was told there was another privilege that was to be mine and I was led into a room where I was informed I was to meet someone As I entered the room I saw seated on a raised platform the most glorious being I have ever conceived of and was taken forward to be introduced to Him As I approached He smiled called my name and stretched out His hands towards me If I live to be a million years old I shall never forget that smile He put His arms around me and kissed me as He took me into His bosom and He blessed me until my whole being was thrilled As He finished I fell at His feet and there saw the marks of the nails and as I kissed them with deep joy swelling through my whole being I felt that I was in heaven indeed The feeling that came to my heart then was Oh If I could live worthy though it would require four score years so that in the end when I have finished I could go into His presence and receive the feeling that I then had in His presence I would give everything that I am or ever hope to be Melvin J Ballard Crusader for Righteousness Salt Lake City Bookcraft 1966 p 65 66 The Spirit of the Lord touched our hearts Very little else was said because this small group of faithful people also knew in their own way that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He is our Savior and our Redeemer We all knew that with greater faith in Him we could reach our goal During that same day family after family came to my office with money making personal sacrifices that were far beyond what I the bishop would ever have asked of them By eight o clock Sunday evening the ward clerk had written receipts for a little more than 30 000 Sacrifice truly brought forth the blessings of heaven to the members of our ward Never have I lived among people who were more united more caring more concerned for one another than these ward members were when making their greatest sacrifice In the midst of this effort the sick of our ward were healed through priesthood blessings The youth committed to live righteously The young men set their goals to be fully worthy to serve missions and most of them did and the young women resolved to settle for nothing but a worthy temple marriage Sisters of the Relief Society found great joy in rendering compassionate service to others and home teaching and visiting teaching were completed every month in the spirit of joy and service In the midst of our greatest sacrifice our ward members became bonded together in the true spirit of the gospel of love and service Sacrifice is a demonstration of pure love The degree of our love for the Lord for the gospel and for our fellowman can be measured by what we are willing to sacrifice for them Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ manifested the supreme example of this love His life and ministry established a pattern for us to follow His divine mission was culminated in a supreme act of love as He allowed His life to be sacrificed for us Having power over life and death He chose to submit himself to pain ridicule and suffering and offered His life as a ransom for our sins Because of His love He suffered both body and spirit to a degree beyond our comprehension and took upon Himself our sins if we repent Through His personal sacrifice He provided a way for us to have our sins forgiven and through Him to find our way back into the presence of our Heavenly Father The sacrifice he requires of us is a broken heart and a contrite spirit 3 Ne 9 20 that can lead us to repentance When we consider His example the demands made upon our time or means are slight in comparison We should therefore give gladly and count it as a blessing and an opportunity I realize that today many faithful members of the Church are sacrificing a great deal to support sons and daughters serving on missions and render other great service in many ways As I have pondered these simple acts of faith I have asked myself however How many of us really measure up to our potential in living the spirit of the law of sacrifice Church members today have been blessed greatly to have some of our financial burdens lifted Faithful payment of tithes that are administered carefully now provides funds for constructing our buildings paying for utilities and meeting many other obligations that formerly necessitated additional contributions We must realize that decreasing these needs for financial contributions gives birth to enlarged opportunities for us to live a higher law By this I mean that on our own initiative we can find ways to extend ourselves in helping others and contributing to the building of the Lord s kingdom The Lord has instructed us that we should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of our own free will and bring to pass much righteousness For the power is in us wherein we are agents unto ourselves D C 58 27 28 My brothers and sisters we must not lose the spirit of sacrifice demonstrated by the handcart pioneers Some of the Lord s choicest blessings await those who practice this eternal principle through extending themselves in service to God and to their fellowmen The sacrificing spirit and the happiness that come through service to others can bring peace and joy even amid trials The principle of sacrifice should be taught in every Latter day Saint home and should be practiced in many simple yet important ways We can do this by setting an example of reverence that will bring the true spirit of worship into our meetings and by guarding against murmuring and complaining about the challenges of the Sunday worship schedule We can contribute a generous fast offering find joy in supporting missionaries and pay an honest tithing We can accept Church callings and serve with a happy and grateful heart do temple work regularly offer family and personal daily prayers and teach one another each week in well planned family home evenings Both younger members and those who are older can prepare early and make themselves worthy to accept calls to serve as missionaries We all can be good neighbors and can take care of widows the poor and the less fortunate We can reach out to others in our service as home and visiting teachers Brethren we must be clean and worthy to bless others with the priesthood we hold Today we are not called to pull handcarts through the snow swept plains of Wyoming However we are called to live foster and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ It is our privilege to invest our means and our time to bless others Each one of us must do all we can to preserve our Latter day Saint way of life A vital part of this preservation is a willingness to set aside personal desires and replace them with unselfish sacrifice for others God bless you brothers and sisters to know as I know that God lives that Jesus is the Christ and that being a member of His church the only true and living church is never a burden but always a great blessing That we may be grateful for this blessing I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear sisters both young and not so young speaking to you for a few minutes tonight is a distinct honor for me I pray that the Lord will bless me that my remarks will be helpful to each one of you I am aware that you are a very diverse audience Tonight I see beautiful young and innocent faces shining with a zest for living I also see white haired grandmothers who radiate a genuine love for the Lord Undoubtedly some of you are newly baptized members while others have spent their lifetime in faithful service to the Church Among you are those who are married and those who are single those who are divorced and raising your children alone and those who are widows Many of you are healthy and happy and are in tune spiritually while others bear the burdens of poor health and loneliness and may be struggling to find peace of mind Some of you very likely are striving to be super moms You feel a need to spend time with your husband and children You want to be sure to have family prayer read the scriptures and have family home evening You also feel the need help children with homework and music lessons keep your home presentable prepare nutritious meals keep clothes clean and mended chauffeur children and possibly their friends to school and to a variety of lessons practices and games and keep everyone in the family on schedule making sure they are where they should be when they should be there And that is all within your family and home It makes me weary just reviewing all of this It doesn t include PTA volunteer service or caring for family members who are ill or aged You feel the need to protect you family from the many evil influences in the world such as suggestive television films and videos alcohol drugs and pornography You are committed to and faithfully fulfill you Church callings In addition many of you must earn a living because financial pressures are real and cannot be ignored If anything is left or neglected you may feel that you have failed To you who feel harried and overwhelmed and who wonder whether you ever will be able to run fast enough to catch the departing train you think you should be on I suggest that you learn to deal with each day as it comes doing the best you can without feelings of guilt or inadequacy I saw a bumper sticker the other day sisters that may say it all God put me on earth to accomplish a certain number of things Right now I am so far behind I will never die Remember sisters we all have our own challenges to work out while passing the tests of mortality and we probably often think ours are the most difficult Recognize limitations no one can do everything When you have done the best you can be satisfied and don t look back and second guess wondering how you could have done more Be at peace within yourselves Rather than berate yourself for what you didn t do congratulate yourself for what you did I give this counsel to my own five daughters and two daughters in law when they worry over whether they are accomplishing all they think they should Remember our Heavenly Father never expects more of us than we can do If your husband and children need this reminder then feel free to share this counsel with them Regardless of your present circumstances you devoted women in this great sisterhood throughout the world are in your unique way performing a remarkable service in helping to establish and strengthen the Church Women play a crucial role in helping people accept the gospel and establish firm testimonies in their hearts Faithful women and young women who have recently joined the Church already are assisting in the work in many newly opened countries in eastern Europe including the Soviet Union The work rolls forward in the vast continent of Africa and is hastened through the service of faithful women Righteous women join the Church in Asia and help to strengthen it in their own lands Many wonderful women valiantly serve the Lord in Latin America and on the islands of the sea In fact dear sisters your influence for good is felt in 135 countries and territories where the gospel is now being taught The strength of this Church from its beginning in 1830 has been and will continue to be enhanced through the faithful service of good women and young women like you To each and every one of you please know how much your leaders love you and pray for you Also know that we understand your challenges and be assured that regardless of your circumstances at the moment each one of you is precious to your Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son the Lord Jesus Christ The general officers of the Church travel throughout the nations of the earth listening teaching and testifying to the truthfulness of the gospel As we visit the members we recognize the positive influence you dear sisters have upon this great work We know you are loyal to the Church and love the Lord We feel your sustaining influence Be patient with the Brethren and know that the General Authorities are teaching priesthood leaders in stakes and wards to listen to you and to counsel with you on matters pertaining to the needs of young and older women Your opinions are valuable even essential to the Brethren because no one else has your perspective and insights You have much to offer in strengthening the homes and families of the Church We marvel at your strength we value your service and we rejoice in your faithful quest for eternal life Through your faith and personal righteousness in keeping the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ you can qualify for all of the blessings our Heavenly Father has promised to His obedient children Some of you may not have an opportunity in mortality to fulfill every righteous desire of your heart But you can be certain that no eternal blessing will be denied you if you remain faithful and live the principles of the gospel throughout your earthly life From time to time leaders of the Church endeavor to give you guidance for your spiritual and temporal welfare One principle that we teach repeatedly is the value of the precious freedom the Lord has given to you to make your own decisions Moral agency enables the children of God to choose what they will believe and how they will live in mortality Based on your obedience in living gospel principles you will be judged according to your works With the marvelous gift of moral agency you can study the scriptures and the teachings of the leaders of the Church and through the promptings of the Spirit make correct choices that will bring peace and eternal joy to your souls Most of you are familiar with Victor Hugo s classic novel Les Miserables A modern composer has brought that story to the musical stage where he chronicles the consequences that grow out of a lifetime of choices some wrong but many gloriously right The central character Jean Valjean is sentenced to years of hard labor for stealing a bit of bread to keep his loved ones from starvation Newly released from prison he finds food and a night s refuge in the home of a priest Bitter and hopeless he slips away before dawn taking with him the silver from the rectory table The police apprehend him and ask the priest to identify the silver as stolen property The priest tells them that not only was the silver given freely but that Valjean had forgotten the two candlesticks that went with it Grateful and humbled Jean vows to live a life of service to God and his fellowmen Years later in a case of mistaken identity a man is brought to trial in Valjean s place Jean now must make a seemingly impossible choice He reviews in his mind the consequences if he chooses to step forward identify himself and serve his own sentence By now he has become very successful He employs thousands they will be jobless He is the mayor his town will suffer He has been benefactor to many they will have no advocate Surely he is justified if he remains silent From the depth of his soul we hear the song s refrain Can I condemn this man to slavery Pretend I do not see his agony Can I conceal myself forevermore If speak I am condemned If I stay silent I am damned And out of despair we hear his decision My soul belongs to God I know I made that bargain long ago He gave me hope when hope was gone He gave me strength to journey on Faced with the ageless question Who am I and recognizing that if he does not speak the one betrayed will be himself he answers Who am I I m Jean Valjean Now my dear sisters each one of you will be required repeatedly to ask the question Who am I I know of no better answer for the women of the Church than the one found in the Young Women theme We are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us and we love Him We will stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places as we strive to live the Young Women values which are faith divine nature individual worth knowledge choice and accountability good works and integrity We believe as we come to accept and act upon these values we will be prepared to make and keep sacred covenants receive the ordinances of the temple and enjoy the blessings of exaltation Ensign Apr 1989 p 45 In my judgment this is an inspired statement and if understood and followed by all of our Father s children this would be a much better world If you live by these truths you will not be carried along with the stream of women who do not seem to know who they are their reason for being or their prominent role in the plan of salvation In 1979 President Spencer W Kimball addressed the women of the Church just as I am doing tonight At that time speaking as the prophet of God using words that are truly prophetic he proclaimed Much of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world in whom there is often such an inner sense of spirituality will be drawn to the Church in large numbers This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives Thus it will be that female exemplars of the Church will be a significant force in both the numerical and the spiritual growth of the Church in the last days Ensign Nov 1979 pp 1034 What an ennobling phrase my beloved sisters Female exemplars What a glorious promise to know that you can strengthen all those around you Young women last October I spoke to the men in the priesthood session of general conference talking to them primarily about morals I told the young men to cultivate a considerate attitude toward women of all ages I taught them to respect you to show you common sincere courtesy I counseled them to never succumb to a feeling that peer pressure is a justification for any kind of moral transgression Transgression of any kind is always accompanied by a loss of self esteem You young women have a responsibility to live exemplary lives so the young men will respect your values and treat you as daughters of God deserve to be treated Righteous daughters of God our Eternal Father are absolutely essential if the Church is to fulfill its destiny in preparing the earth for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ May God bless you dear sisters that each one of you can be an example a light to those around you You are daughters of your Heavenly Father who loves you May each one of you manifest your love for Him through your righteous exemplary life Always know in your hearts dear sisters that the Church is true I testify to you that Jesus Christ lives and that He presides over this Church President Benson is the prophet of the Lord Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son love the precious women of the Church as do all of your leaders May God bless you now and always is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
A relatively simple but significant event took place in Nauvoo Illinois on the fourth of August this year After many months of careful planning the descendants of Joseph Smith Sr and Lucy Mack Smith dedicated the refurbished Smith Family Cemetery and opened it to the public As I attended the dedicatory services my thoughts were centered on the remarkable contribution the family of Joseph Smith Sr and Lucy Mack Smith made toward the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ I was thinking especially of the Prophet his brother Hyrum and their parents I believe the Smith family burial plot should have a special meaning to every member of the Church We all want those who are interred there to rise up on resurrection day in a beautiful garden spot The Prophet said in a funeral sermon I will tell you what I want If tomorrow I shall be called to lie in yonder tomb in the morning of the resurrection let me strike hands with my father and cry My father and he will say My son my son as soon as the rock rends and before we come out of our graves And when the voice calls for the dead to arise suppose I am laid by the side of my father what would be the first joy of my heart To meet my father my mother my brother my sister and when they are by my side I embrace them and they me History of the Church 5 361 62 Each person who has a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ should love and appreciate Joseph Smith Jr for he is the Prophet and Seer of the Lord who has done more save Jesus only for the salvation of men in this world than any other man that ever lived in it D C 135 3 The ancient prophet Nephi wrote that he was born of goodly parents 1 Ne 1 1 So was the Prophet Joseph Smith he once declared Words and language are inadequate to express the gratitude that I owe to God for having given me so honorable a parentage History of the Church 5 126 The Lord foreordained his father Joseph Smith Sr who is spoken of in the holy scriptures to be one of the earthly parents of the Prophet Joseph of Egypt prophesied that the latter day seer whom God would raise up to do his work would be called Joseph JST Gen 50 33 and his name would be after the name of his father 2 Ne 3 15 The heavenly messenger Moroni admonished young Joseph to go to his father following a glorious night of sacred instruction In Joseph s words this messenger commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received I obeyed I returned to my father in the field and rehearsed the whole matter to him He replied to me that it was of God and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger JS H 1 49 50 Joseph Smith Sr was in tune with the Spirit of the Lord He knew that his young son spoke the truth He not only believed the boy s words but encouraged him in the work he had been called to do Joseph Sr endured ridicule and persecution because of his prophet son s experiences and claims Yet he was unwavering in his loving support and defended his son He saw and handled the plates of gold from which the Book of Mormon was translated and testified throughout his life to the truthfulness of that sacred book His name remains firmly affixed with those of the other witnesses to the Book of Mormon in the front pages of that second witness of Jesus Christ On one occasion he was imprisoned and told he would be released if he would deny the Book of Mormon Not only did he not deny it but he converted two persons during his thirty day confinement President Lorenzo Snow said I do not know that any man among the Saints was more loved than Father Smith and when any one was seriously sick Father Smith would be called for whether it was night or day He was as noble and generous a man as I have ever known Quoted in LeRoi C Snow How Lorenzo Snow Found God Improvement Era Feb 1937 p 84 At the time of his death Joseph Smith Sr was described as a man faithful to his God and to the Church in every situation and under all circumstances through which he was called to pass History of the Church 4 192 Just a few months following his passing from this life the Lord revealed that Joseph Smith Sr was in His presence and blessed and holy is he for he is mine D C 124 19 Indeed Joseph Smith Sr played a vital role in establishing the kingdom of God upon the earth Perhaps less visible than the Prophet s father but equally important in shaping and influencing his life was his mother Lucy Mack Smith Although this strong woman gave occasional leadership her primary role appeared to be support to the family She gave birth to eleven children and endured faithfully as all but four preceded her in death During her life she watched six of her immediate family and one grandson die as a result of ruthless mob violence and persecution Lucy prepared herself early in her marriage to raise a prophet On one occasion she became seriously ill and the doctors said she would die Lucy records that she made a solemn covenant with God that if He would let me live I would endeavor to serve him according to the best of my abilities After a voice assured her that she would live she told her mother the Lord will let me live if I am faithful to the promise which I made to him to be a comfort to my mother my husband and my children Lucy Mack Smith History of Joseph Smith by His Mother Lucy Mack Smith ed Preston Nibley Salt Lake City Bookcraft 1979 pp 34 She gave continual encouragement support and strength to her son Joseph the Prophet His mother was the first person with whom young Joseph shared some of his momentous experiences of the Sacred Grove Years later he shared with her the joy and relief he felt when the Lord allowed others to view the sacred plates of gold Lucy wrote that Joseph threw himself down beside me and exclaimed you do not know how happy I am the Lord has now caused the plates to be shown to three more besides myself They have seen an angel and they will have to bear witness to the truth of what I have said for now they know for themselves that I do not go about to deceive the people and I feel as if I was relieved of a burden which was almost too heavy for me to bear Lucy Mack Smith History p 152 The Prophet s mother shared also in his sorrows sufferings and persecutions One time a mob took Joseph and his brother Hyrum prisoner and threatened to shoot them The two brothers were confined under a cloth cover in a wagon Their courageous mother risked her life and forced her way through the hostile mob to comfort her sons Joseph and Hyrum could not see their mother and could only extend a hand from under the confining cover As Lucy s hand and the hands of her sons touched the wagon drove off literally tearing the sorrowing mother from her two sons Her determination to testify to the restoration of the gospel may have led her to dictate her well known History of Joseph Smith This was a major undertaking in her day The book s importance to the Church today is immeasurable It contains many details of the Prophet Joseph s life that might never have been known otherwise It stands as a monument to the devotion of Lucy Mack Smith and her family Like great parents of all ages Lucy turned to prayer for divine help to sustain her family During the march from Ohio to Missouri known as Zion s Camp Joseph and Hyrum were seriously ill with cholera and their lives were almost taken At one point Hyrum sprang to his feet and exclaimed Joseph we shall return to our families I have had an open vision in which I saw mother kneeling under an apple tree and she is even now asking God in tears to spare our lives The Spirit testifies that her prayers will be answered Lucy Mack Smith History p 229 In the exercise of agency and in the divine providence of God Lucy s sons Joseph and Hyrum ultimately sealed their testimonies with their blood As the grieving mother looked upon their lifeless remains she cried My God my God why hast thou forsaken this family As a kind blessing to a faithful mother the Lord softened her grief and granted to her the peace that only God can bestow A voice spoke to her soul I have taken them to myself that they might have rest Lucy Mack Smith History p 324 Hyrum Smith older brother friend and mentor to the Prophet showed absolute unequivocal love loyalty and allegiance to the Lord and to his younger brother Joseph Their brotherhood may be unsurpassed The scriptures tell us In life they were not divided and in death they were not separated D C 135 3 Of Hyrum Joseph said I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother Hyrum who possesses the mildness of a lamb and the integrity of a Job and in short the meekness and humility of Christ and I love him with that love that is stronger than death for I never had occasion to rebuke him nor he me History of the Church 2 338 Throughout Hyrum s life he guarded his younger brother as tenderly as if the Prophet had been his own son Joseph surely knew the value of true and faithful associates because he had trusted many who later proved to be false In addition to Joseph s tribute the Lord spoke of His love for Hyrum Blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith for I the Lord love him because of the integrity of his heart and because he loveth that which is right before me saith the Lord D C 124 15 Hyrum was unwavering even in the face of death Following one period of great deprivation and persecution he wrote I thank God that I felt a determination to die rather than deny the things which my eyes had seen which my hands had handled the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated and which I had borne testimony to wherever my lot had been cast and I can assure my beloved brethren that I was enabled to bear as strong a testimony when nothing but death presented itself as ever I did in my life Times and Seasons Dec 1839 p 23 From the Prophet Joseph and Hyrum we can learn many valuable lessons I share just these two examples today In a letter dated March 15 1844 just a few months before his martyrdom Hyrum wrote Now therefore I say unto you you must cease preaching your miraculous things and let the mysteries alone until by and bye sic Preach faith in the Lord Jesus Christ repentance and baptism for the remission of sins the laying on of the hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost teaching the necessity of strict obedience unto these principles reasoning out of the scriptures proving them unto the people Cease your schisms and divisions and your contentions Humble yourselves Times and Seasons 15 Mar 1844 p 474 And then from the Prophet Joseph There are those who profess to be Saints who are too apt to murmur and find fault when any advice is given which comes in opposition to their feelings even when they themselves ask for counsel much more so when counsel is given unasked for which does not agree with their notion of things but brethren we hope for better things from the most of you we trust that you desire counsel from time to time and that you will cheerfully conform to it whenever you receive it from a proper source History of the Church 4 45 These inspired statements from Hyrum and Joseph to Church members in their day are certainly appropriate for Church members today While standing in Nauvoo at the foot of the headstone of these noble men I had the impression that they would have me counsel all members of the Church to remain anchored to the basic and simple principles of the gospel Study the scriptures look to the leaders of the Church for guidance in these troubled times Brothers and sisters be careful of the schisms divisions and contentions that are among us today Keep the commandments so the Holy Ghost will be with you in your search for truth and knowledge I bear humble witness that Joseph Smith is one of the great noble ones to come to the earth He and his brother Hyrum deserve our honor respect and gratitude as do other members of their family who assisted with the restoration of the fulness of the gospel I testify that President Ezra Taft Benson is the prophet of God at this time and the Apostles and other General Authorities who are seated on this stand are ordained of God to preside over the Church Jesus our Lord and Savior stands at the head of the Church Our Heavenly Father lives and watches over each of His children To this I humbly testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
During this past Christmas season I had the privilege of participating in the Washington D C Visitors Center Christmas lighting celebration When I turned on the 200 000 lights they seemed to dance and sparkle in the trees with the majestic temple glowing in the background That night outside of their Soviet community for the first time thirty five children from the Soviet Embassy School performed They presented the dances and songs of their homeland beautifully Following their program boys and girls who were members of the Church performed for an appreciative audience that included embassy officials from twenty two nations The children who were members of the Church were sitting on risers that had been placed directly in front of the eight foot Christus statue that stands as the focal point of the visitors center lobby The Soviet children were sitting with their teachers and parents apart from our youngsters When I stood to speak these beautiful young people with their vibrant countenances captured my attention I asked the Soviet boys and girls to come and sit with our youth As they did it was a beautiful sight and an appropriate way to begin the Christmas season Sweet and pure children from two powerful nations showed an instant love for one another as they were seated at the feet of the Christus I said to the audience that perhaps the world s troubles could be solved if we could turn over the leadership of nations to the children for a few days Through love they would find solutions to the misunderstandings mistrust and misconduct of adults in the world I had the clear impression that night that if all men and women could love Jesus Christ as these lovely children do many world problems could be solved Sooner perhaps than we realize the fate of nations will be in the hands of today s children An anonymous author penned it this way I saw tomorrow passing on little children s feetAnd on their forms and faces her prophecies complete And then I saw tomorrow look at me through little children s eyes And I thought how carefully I must teach if I am wise My dear brothers and sisters if we are concerned about our tomorrows we will teach our children wisely and carefully for in them lie our tomorrows Have you seen the future when you gazed through the hospital nursery window and saw the bassinet wheeled into your view You see that beautiful newborn infant for the first time A new spirit comes into your life as a son or daughter grandchild or child of a friend and you know that your life will never be quite the same again How often have you had to blink back the tears as you stood in awe and contemplated the miracle of a new life This newly arrived spirit has come in sweet innocence from the presence of God Every human being is a spirit child of God and lived with Heavenly Father before coming to earth He entrusts his spirit children to earthly parents who provide a mortal body for them through the miracle of physical birth and gives to parents the sacred opportunity and responsibility to love protect teach and to bring them up in light and truth so they may one day through the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ return to our Father s presence These precious souls come to us in purity and innocence As parents we assume an immense responsibility for their care and well being Parents share this sacred trust with brothers and sisters grandparents teachers neighbors and all who touch the lives and impress or influence the souls of these precious children King Benjamin admonished parents many years ago But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness ye will teach them to love one another and to serve one another Mosiah 4 15 The critical nature of the first tender formative years cannot be overstated These little ones are like seedlings in a plant nursery All look much the same in the beginning but each one will grow to become independent and unique Parents are to nourish tend and teach their children so they will grow to their full stature and potential Parents and teachers should see beyond the little girl in pigtails and should not be misled by the ragged little boy with a dirty face and holes in the knees of his pants True teachers and leaders see children as they may become They see the valiant missionary who will one day share his testimony with the world and later become a righteous father who honors his priesthood The inspired teacher sees pure and beautiful mothers and future presidents of the Relief Society Young Women and Primary even though today they may be girls who giggle and chatter on the back row in the classroom Sometimes people say Well boys will be boys Not so boys will be men and almost before we know it To see our children grow succeed and take their places in society and in the Lord s kingdom is an eternal reward worth any inconvenience or sacrifice Oh that every parent could understand that children come from a premortal experience and have possibilities that often are far beyond what we might expect We should spare no effort to help our children reach their full potential Is it any wonder that Jesus brought the little children unto himself to teach and bless them He said Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me Mark 9 37 He also said Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish Matt 18 14 When asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven the Savior called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them And said Verily I say unto you Except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven Matt 18 1 4 italics added A recent experience illustrates the importance of each of these little children One Saturday morning I was preparing for an activity with one of my grandsons But before we could make our exit out the door I heard another small voice inquiring Can I go too Grandpa Did you ever try to say no to such a request That activity would not have been the same without that someone else who really wanted to go too Just as surely heaven will not be heaven if some of our children who want to go too are left behind Some may choose not to go Our Heavenly Father has given them the agency to choose for themselves We have the task of helping them learn about our Heavenly Father s plan for us demonstrating our faith in the Lord and continuing to work with our children in prayerful and patient persuasion To teach our children the gospel of Jesus Christ and to protect them from the influences of a wicked world love must abide in our homes We should cherish and care for our children with unwavering dedication The older we grow the more precious our family becomes to us We come to see more clearly that all of the wealth honor and positions of the world pale in significance when compared to the precious souls of our loved ones You young parents who are beginning your families must guard against seeking financial gain worldly comforts or achievement at the expense of your children You must guard against being so anxious to get to work or to a meeting that you do not have time for your family especially time to listen to anxious little voices Always remember this timeless counsel from a prophet of God President David O McKay No other success can compensate for failure in the home Improvement Era June 1964 p 445 We cannot and we must not allow the school community television or even Church organizations to establish our children s values The Lord has placed this duty with mothers and fathers It is one from which we cannot escape and one that cannot be delegated Others may help but parents remain accountable Therefore we must guard the sanctity of our homes because that is where children develop their values attitudes and habits for everyday living Children perceive their own identity much earlier than we may realize They want to be recognized as individuals Not long ago as my wife visited with our daughter her three year old son ran to his grandmother She picked him up and said Hi how are you doing Babes He looked at her and said with a serious voice I not a Babes I a Dude In the vernacular of the day he was asserting that he was someone special he had a place and he belonged What a beautiful place this world will be when every father and mother see the importance of teaching their children the principles that will help them be happy and successful Parents teach best when they lead by good example govern their little ones with patience kindness and love unfeigned and have the same spirit of love for children that Jesus exemplified In times of need a father may bless his children through the righteous exercise of his priesthood Every mother can accept her children from her Father in Heaven as her great source of joy She will know that because her children are also children of God no sacrifice is too great to protect them from evil and to surround them with a spirit of love and trust in God One of our grandsons when he was five years old became confused when his family moved into a new ward He thought the meetings were over and went outside When he realized he was alone and could not find the family or their car he knelt down and prayed for help Just a few minutes later one of the counselors in the Primary presidency came out and asked him if he was lost A Primary teacher had called to her from the door of a classroom and said that someone was missing The teacher asked the counselor to find out who it was The counselor felt impressed to look outside and went straight to our grandson Later the teacher and counselor both commented on how strong their impressions were that he needed help We were thankful that his parents and Primary teachers had taught him that Heavenly Father loves him and had taught him to always pray for help Priesthood leaders should select dedicated spiritually guided Primary teachers Teachers should teach by love and example after prayerful preparation A loving teacher each Sunday can calm the fear of new surroundings and help children want to come to Church meetings One five year old girl began to cry as the family was preparing for Sunday meetings When asked why she sobbed I don t know who my teacher will be Her class had had several teachers in recent months the frequent change had disturbed the peace of that tender little soul Our children do not grow to full physical stature suddenly In like manner their spiritual growth takes place over time This development might be compared to erecting a block building The walls are formed block by block with a strong mortar holding each block to the others We could give these building blocks names such as bedtime stories listening to a child pray tucking a child in bed at night and a quiet review of the day s activities Other blocks could be pleasant dinner conversations praise for tasks well done birthday parties and family outings Others could be doing your chores being kind to one another reading from the scriptures together serving others and saying I love you Still other blocks could be learning to work taking responsibility respecting elders singing together doing homework attending Primary and honoring the Sabbath day Even larger blocks are family home evening respecting and honoring the priesthood and family prayer A vast array of such beautiful building blocks that are placed carefully can form a fortress of faith that the tidal waves of worldly distraction and evil cannot breach These blocks are held together with a mortar called love love of Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ love of parents love for each other love for choosing the good Many children have only one parent at home and some are left with no parents at all We all share a responsibility to help fill such voids and to provide sustained assistance and encouragement On the negative side we hear disturbing reports of parents or guardians who are so far removed from the Spirit of Christ that they abuse children Whether this abuse is physical verbal or the less evident but equally severe emotional abuse it is an abomination and a serious offense to God Jesus left no question about the seriousness of harming children in any way when he said But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea Matt 18 6 We plead with you to take time for your children and your grandchildren while they are young Special moments may come only once Before we are aware they have grown older and our best opportunity for teaching them how to live happy and fulfilling lives is past I know that we are all spirit children of a loving Heavenly Father brothers and sisters every one of us with a glorious destiny if we will humble ourselves as little children and keep the commandments of God May we be blessed with the Spirit of Christ in our own lives and may we have his Spirit with us in teaching little children is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My remarks are directed primarily to you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood The subject is the moral cleanliness of our youth The leaders of the Church care so deeply about every one of you that I feel an urgent need to warn you once again of the consequences of moral misconduct At the same time I want to impress upon you the great promises extended to those who remain morally clean We are aware that the youth of the Church are growing up in a world that is plagued with teenage moral misconduct We also know that sexual sin has increased tremendously during the past twenty years Far too many of the youth particularly American youth have violated the law of chastity before they reach the age of nineteen Unfortunately the youth of the Church are not immune For this reason I want to assure you young men that your leaders know of the challenges you face in today s society However we have confidence that you can develop the strength and integrity to surmount these challenges and live for the blessings that are promised to those who remain morally clean I emphasize that you do not need to be caught in the trap of being immoral not one of you ever Each one of you must look into the future to understand the consequences of your actions both good and bad The cartoon character Ziggy said it this way Our future is shaped by our past so be very careful what you do in your past Let me relate a personal experience to show the importance of keeping your future continually in mind When I was in the Aaronic Priesthood I and one of my friends attended general priesthood meeting in this tabernacle and found ourselves over here by the stairs where we didn t belong President George Albert Smith in his kindly way saw our plight and invited us to sit on the stairs As we sat there and watched the proceedings of the meeting I did not believe that I ever again would get that close to this pulpit I remember saying to my friend as we left the Tabernacle It would sure be nice to be a General Authority then you would have one of those seats on the stand to sit in I know now by personal experience that in some ways brethren the benches you are sitting on are much more comfortable than these on the stand Now the point As an Aaronic Priesthood holder I had no idea that the time would come in my life when I would serve as a bishop a mission president a Seventy and now as an Apostle We cannot foresee what the Lord has in mind for us Our only course of action is to be prepared and worthy for whatever he requires We must govern our actions every day with our future in mind One of Satan s clever tactics is to tempt us to concentrate on the present and ignore the future The Lord warned Joseph Smith that Satan seeketh to turn their hearts away from the truth that they become blinded and understand not the things which are prepared for them D C 78 10 The things which are prepared for them are the promised rewards of eternal life which come as a result of obedience The devil attempts to blind us to these rewards President Heber J Grant said that if we are faithful in keeping the commandments of God His promises will be fulfilled to the very letter The trouble is the adversary of men s souls blinds their minds He throws dust so to speak in their eyes and they are blinded with the things of this world Gospel Standards Salt Lake City Improvement Era 1942 pp 44 45 He tempts us with the transitory pleasures of the world so that we will not focus our minds and efforts on the things that bring eternal joy The devil is a dirty fighter and we must be aware of his tactics Recently I talked with several groups of young men and women in Utah and Idaho They told me that some of our youth feel that they can be immoral during their teen years and then repent when they decide to go on a mission or be married in the temple Some young men talk about a mission as a time when they will be forgiven from their past sins They have the notion that a few transgressions now are no big deal because they can repent quickly go on a mission and then live happily ever after Young men please believe me when I tell you that this scenario is a gross deception by Satan it is a fairy tale Sin will always always result in suffering It may come sooner or it may come later but it will come The scriptures state that you will stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God Jacob 6 9 and that you will experience a lively sense of guilt and pain and anguish Mosiah 2 38 A related misconception is that repentance is easy President Kimball said that one has not begun to repent until he has suffered intensely for his sins If a person hasn t suffered he hasn t repented The Teachings of Spencer W Kimball Salt Lake City Bookcraft 1982 pp 88 99 You need only talk to a person who has truly repented of serious sin to understand that the momentary pleasure of an immoral act is simply not worth the pain that always follows The youth told me that some are tempted to be immoral because they want to be accepted by their peers For the young men it may mean acceptance based on some sort of macho image For the young women it may be the need to feel they are accepted by having a boyfriend Acceptance by your peers must not come at the expense of your virtue and self esteem King Benjamin indicates that those guilty of sin will shrink from the presence of the Lord Mosiah 2 38 In a very real way those who have been immoral shrink from the presence of others their friends their parents other members of their family and Church leaders Now let us consider the grand blessings the Lord has promised those who are obedient to the commandment to be morally clean You never need to repent of a sin you have not committed That seems obvious but I want to emphasize it Repentance is a great blessing but you should never make yourself sick just so you can try out the remedy You are infinitely better to maintain your spiritual health by staying morally clean If you feel confident in the presence of your parents peers and priesthood leaders you can sense how you will feel when you have the confidence and acceptance of the Savior Can you think of any better promise for the future than spoken by King Benjamin I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God For behold they are blessed in all things both temporal and spiritual and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never ending happiness Mosiah 2 41 The youth told me that a clean conscience improves their self esteem Their relationships with others are better and they enjoy a very positive acceptance In fact some of them said they have lots more fun because of their high standards They never have to worry about the dreaded diseases that often follow those who transgress the law of chastity Here are some suggestions that will help you stay morally clean First understand the standards of moral cleanliness The Lord said concerning his commandments I give unto you directions how you may act before me that it may turn to you for your salvation D C 82 9 In other words commandments are guidance for happy living Our youth seem confused about the definition of moral cleanliness Some young men and women take a certain definition and then push it to its limits to see how far they can go without being immoral by that definition I suggest an opposite approach Several years ago Elder Hartman Rector who spent twenty six years as a navy pilot gave an interesting analogy The navy had a rule that said in effect Thou shalt not fly thy airplane in the trees That makes sense But to ensure that he obeyed this rule he set his own standard Thou shalt not fly thy airplane closer than 5 000 feet to the trees He said When you do this you make the navy s commandment of not flying in the trees easy to live Ensign Jan 1973 p 131 Some standards must not be compromised If you are not sure about the Church s standard of morality talk to your parents or to your priesthood leaders Also you can know the correct standards of moral conduct by following the promptings of the Spirit These promptings never will lead you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable unclean or ashamed You must be sensitive to these promptings because your physical passions can obscure them if you are not careful Second once you understand the standards you must determine that you will live by them This kind of commitment is a fundamental gospel principle The scriptures teach that there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it Abr 3 17 You must be the same way You must be as Joseph who fled from the presence of Potiphar s wife rather than sin against God See Gen 39 7 12 You must avoid moral misconduct by making a firm decision to avoid compromising situations and to stand firm for what is right You must have self control and high goals I urge every one of you tonight to set a goal to be morally clean if you have not already done so Third while you must exercise your agency and bear the responsibility for your decisions you need not face temptation alone Just two weeks ago at a stake conference Elder Charles Tiny Grant one of our fine regional representatives shared an experience with us He said that some years ago while he was the football coach at Ricks College he met a man named Hal Barton who was famous for his love of fishing He was warned however that although Hal knows where to find the big fish he often goes into strong waters to find them Their first opportunity to go fishing together was in February as the ice was breaking up As they walked together up the river Hal pointed to an island about fifty yards away and said Coach that is where we will find the big ones The day was cold and now they had to cross a dangerous part of the river The coach soon discovered that the rocks were round and slick and the water was only inches from the top of his waders Since he is six feet five inches tall that meant it was deep He was about to tell Hal that he was afraid he couldn t cross the water but realized that the football coach could not admit that he was afraid Just then Hal said Coach this is how we are going to cross the water You take a step and get a firm footing while I hold your hand and arm steady Then I will take a step while you stand firmly and furnish the support We will work our way through this roiling swift water over these slippery rocks With this mutual support they crossed the river safely and caught the big ones This is an excellent analogy for the way you can live the Lord s standard of morality Some who have gone before you have a firm footing having lived the moral standard and experienced the blessings of doing so As you take steps into the deep water of life they will support you Then as you gain a firm footing in righteousness you can help others who come after you Generally your most important source of support is your parents Their teachings should be a powerful influence in your decision to be clean I realize however that morality can be a sensitive subject I urge you young men to initiate conversations with your parents about their moral values Ask them to help you define the standards that will keep you morally clean Also seek counsel from your priesthood leaders especially your bishop He knows the standards and he knows what to teach you Seek opportunities to be with him You can expect him to ask pointed searching questions Trust him Confide in him Ask him to help you understand what the Lord expects from you Make a commitment to live according to the Church s standards of morality A meaningful relationship with an adult leader is vital to help you keep morally clean and worthy Your Aaronic Priesthood advisers will teach you and give you the support and direction you may need Ask them for guidance They will know how to help you Fourth choose friends who share your standards both members and nonmembers Such friends will make peer pressure uplifting and positive The young men and women I talked to said that acceptance of the peer group is a powerful influence either for good or bad When your friends observe high moral standards you are more likely to do the same When you have established a strong bond with such friends you can reach out to those who have not made firm decisions about morality Help them to know that immorality is not cool Fifth you young men must cultivate a considerate attitude toward women of all ages The young women asked me to tell you that they want you to respect them and show them common sincere courtesy Do not hesitate to show your good manners by opening a door for them taking the initiative in inviting them on a date and standing as they enter a room Believe it or not in this age of equal rights the young women want you to extend these simple courtesies Finally seek help from the Lord the source of spiritual power If you call on his holy name and watch and pray continually you will not be tempted above that which ye can bear Alma 13 28 Your daily prayers must include a heartfelt request for help in keeping your commitment to remain morally clean When you do this the Lord will bless you with the strength to remain morally clean Remember young men that purity precedes power The Lord said But purify your hearts before me and then go ye into all the world and preach my gospel unto every creature who has not received it D C 112 28 Missionaries discover this very early in their missions and make every effort to be worthy so they can serve with power Now just a word to those of you who have violated the moral law I hold out the hope of repentance to you The Savior s atonement provides forgiveness when you have repented completely You will necessarily suffer because of sin but you can know the joy of being forgiven completely Your bishop can guide you through the process of repentance so talk to him as soon as possible You must also seek divine forgiveness through your personal prayers Alma said Never until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy did I receive a remission of my sins But behold I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul Alma 38 8 Once you have forsaken your sins never return to them because unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return D C 82 7 Tonight I echo the prayer offered by President Hugh B Brown in a setting such as this more than twenty years ago when the moral misconduct of youth was not as commonplace as it is today He prayed O Father help these young men who are listening tonight when they go home to get on their knees and commit themselves to thee and then they may know and I promise them in thy name that they will know that with thy help they need not fear the future Improvement Era Dec 1967 p 94 Brethren we need not fear the future if we will keep the Lord s commandments and live to be his worthy servants You can stay morally clean and prepare now for a happy future May the Lord bless every one of you to so live I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters I suppose you are as amazed as I am with the monumental world events that we see unfolding As Latter day Saints we recognize the hand of God working to bring about his purposes in the earth We know that the stone that was cut out without hands will continue to roll forth to fill the whole earth See Dan 2 34 35 These are exciting times to be alive We observe vast sweeping world events however we must remember that the purposes of the Lord in our personal lives generally are fulfilled through the small and simple things and not the momentous and spectacular Alma teaching his son Helaman about the importance of the record written on the plates of brass said Behold I say unto you that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass and small means in many instances doth confound the wise And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls Alma 37 6 7 To illustrate let me read from a letter written by one of our faithful sister missionaries serving in South America to her brother who had just received his mission call She wrote It s really interesting with the people from the country they are so quiet timid shy and embarrassed You are never sure exactly how much they understand They will live and die in this small town They are so poor and so simple and so childlike They may never see a General Authority never attend general conference never go to BYU They ll never be Boy Scouts never play basketball in a huge Church gym never drive a car to stake conference regional basketball finals or anywhere Many of the things we think about when we think of the Church and take for granted they may never see Now the point But they have faith they repent they are baptized they receive the Holy Ghost and they renew their baptismal covenants each week when they partake of the sacrament They pray and read the scriptures daily They know God lives and that Christ is our Savior And I believe they are going to the celestial kingdom I do all the things they never will but I m not so sure about my own salvation At first glance the Church here looks absolutely nothing like the Church in downtown Orem Utah I have to keep reminding myself it is the same church and we all follow the same prophet We have a sacrament meeting in the country each week because the members there really can t afford to come into town And as I sit there outside on a wooden chair on the plain ground with the sun setting and the six people in attendance as we sing hymns pray and partake of the sacrament I wonder if that isn t closer to Christ s church than at home But I guess it is really the same The things that matter the true elements of the gospel as Christ taught in 3 Nephi 11 are the same here as they are in Orem Utah 3 Ne 11 The Lord has graciously provided the means for conversion even in the most simple and humble of circumstances Unfortunately some of us look beyond the mark and depend too much on buildings budgets programs and activities for conversion rather than on the small and simple things that are central to the gospel We need not look beyond our own hearts to experience the sweet spiritual feelings promised to those who obey God That is why a new member in the most humble conditions can experience the gospel as deeply as a lifetime member who was raised in the shadow of Church headquarters As I meet with some of these humble members I observe that the Church is by necessity being established among them in the most simple way possible The gospel is taught from the scriptures and from the Gospel Principles manual The people feel the Spirit and bear testimonies as they come unto Christ and are baptized in his name Their love for the Lord radiates from their faces They know that faith repentance baptism the Holy Ghost service to others and keeping the commandments are the essentials for exaltation in the celestial kingdom Last month Elder Charles Didier and I visited the Saints and missionaries in Trinidad and Tobago Guyana Suriname and French Guiana We dedicated each of these lands for establishing the Lord s work We see a vast difference between the humble circumstances in areas where the Church is still in its tender infancy and the circumstances we are accustomed to in areas where the Church is stable and mature When we visited Suriname we met most of the members and learned that the missionary couple serving there Elder and Sister Limburg had taught them the gospel using a series of simple teaching and learning methods They had no momentous or spectacular events or activities only daily spiritual experiences resulting from their sensitive response to the promptings of the Spirit A new missionary couple Brother and Sister Don Rapier arrived in Suriname one day ahead of Elder Didier and me so they met the Saints for the first time along with us We held four sacrament meetings in homes of the Saints on the Sunday we were there Elder Rapier shared his feelings about blessing the sacrament in the humble home of one of our new converts He said This was the most humble circumstance that I had ever been in in my life The house was made of mostly short pieces of lumber No electricity no running water The roof was corrugated sheets The house and the yard were clean The place where we held our sacrament meeting was under the overhang in front of the house The members and the Brethren sat on wooden boards that were laid on bricks The sacrament table was a small wooden stand that was set on top of a piece of linoleum covering the dirt floor The sacrament cloths were very simple and very clean As I knelt down to bless the sacrament I was overwhelmed with the spirit of love that I had quickly developed for this people I thought surely our Savior was pleased that He was being remembered in such humble circumstances I thought of our chapels at home I could never have appreciated the sacrament there like I can now after this special experience I also observed that it might take several years before these sweet humble members would fully realize the significance of having two General Authorities one an Apostle in their home blessing them and their family Brother Rapier s experience touched deeply each one of us who was there After the fourth sacrament meeting my mind reflected upon the words of the Lord Wherefore be not weary in well doing for ye are laying the foundation of a great work And out of small things proceedeth that which is great D C 64 33 Another example of the importance of small things comes from Elder and Sister Jackson missionaries serving in Guyana When we first arrived in the mission field in Guyana we saw in the local Georgetown newspaper the report of the Teenager of the Month In the report he said his favorite food was macaroni We took the newspaper clipping a Book of Mormon and a box of macaroni and knocked on his door We have taught and baptized seven of the family since our first visit This small thing resulted in a great benefit in establishing the Church in Guyana While having these tender spiritual experiences this past month I was sobered by how small and simple things can be negative and destructive to a person s salvation A series of seemingly small but incorrect choices can become those little soul destroying termites that eat away at the foundations of our testimony until before we are aware we may be brought near to spiritual and moral destruction This past month one of the missionaries who served with Sister Ballard and me in Canada shared the details of how small things can compound into near destruction unless the course is corrected He wrote When I returned from my mission I married and went to work in the construction industry Over the next few years we had three children and during this time I remained active in the Church The demands of my business became much greater and I became more determined to do whatever it would take to succeed financially The effects of this were felt immediately at home but with the support of an understanding wife we felt we could endure until things picked up He went on to say that because of financial strains his wife began working He began working long hours and neglected his family and Church duties His demanding work schedule left him emotionally drained and physically exhausted He became critical of others including his family members and Church leaders His letter continues As my debt continued to mount the destruction of my peace and happiness increased The love and tenderness we once knew as husband and wife had diminished to only memories We found character flaws in each other and began to focus on them wounding each other over the smallest incident I began to blame everyone but myself taking no responsibility for failures A great feeling of hopelessness began to fill my heart and I felt a cloud of darkness envelop me in my desperation We knew our marriage could not endure under such conditions and began to talk in terms of divorce I decided to get some financial counseling and after reviewing my finances it became the joke that I was worth more dead than alive which seemed funny and rather innocent at the time After continuing for a few more weeks the threat of divorce as well as the very real threat of complete financial collapse seemed only a matter of time The innocent joke of being worth more dead than alive developed into the appearance of a very real solution I found myself alone at home facing the crossroads of my decision The thought came to me to reach out to the Lord one last time Kneeling I wept uncontrollably as I cried to the Lord for his mercy and help in my desperate hour A few minutes later word came that my mission president was in town and wanted to see me in an hour As I sat with you I wanted to hide my problems as I had done from everyone else But your questions came asking How are you Fine How is your wife Doing good How are the children Great Then came the pause and you looked into my eyes and asked How is your business I began to weep as I told you my story During the course of our meeting you asked me to make you a promise that I would read the Book of Mormon After committing to you that I would you blessed me telling me to rivet myself to the gospel and to keep the commandments I left you knowing the Lord had heard my plea for help Can you see brothers and sisters how many small and simple things took their toll in the life of this fine young man Like weak fibers that form a yarn then a strand and finally a rope these small things combined together can become too strong to be broken We must ever be aware of the power that the small and simple things can have in building spirituality At the same time we must be aware that Satan will use small and simple things to lead us into despair and misery I am grateful that the Lord answered the prayers of this young man by prompting me to do the seemingly small thing of asking to see him I did not know of any of his problems at the time but was able to help him to once again take hold of the iron rod of the gospel to guide his life We must never ignore or pass by the prompting of the Spirit to render service to one another Great and marvelous events seem to motivate us but small things often do not hold our attention Noting that the Liahona worked by faith Alma stated Nevertheless because those miracles were worked by small means the people of Lehi were slothful and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased and they did not progress in their journey Alma 37 41 Is our journey sometimes impeded when we forget the importance of small things See Alma 37 46 Do we realize that small events and choices determine the direction of our lives just as small helms determine the direction of great ships See James 3 4 D C 123 16 Are we ever like Naaman the leper expecting some great thing before we will pay attention to prophets See 2 Kgs 5 1 14 May the Lord bless each one of us to follow the counsel of our prophets We need to have family and personal prayers study the scriptures particularly the Book of Mormon hold family home evenings follow the admonition of the Savior to love one another and be thoughtful kind and gentle within the family Through these and other similar small and simple things we have the promise that our lives will be filled with peace and joy I know that Jesus Christ lives and that this is his Church I testify that his gospel will continue to fill the world as it continues to fill the hearts of the individual members of the Church In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters since April s general conference some of our missionaries have found themselves in increasingly more difficult circumstances As the adviser to the South America North Area Presidency I was saddened as I know you were at the news that two faithful missionaries Elder Todd Ray Wilson and Elder Jeffrey Brent Ball lost their lives in Bolivia The deaths of these two righteous young men while they were in the service of the Lord caused the entire Church membership to mourn We grieve also for other missionaries who have died from illness or accident since the first of the year Our sorrow at the loss of any faithful missionary can be tempered by this declaration from the Lord himself And whoso layeth down his life in my cause for my name s sake shall find it again even life eternal D C 98 13 To all parents family members and friends of missionaries who have lost their lives while in the service of the Master we extend to you our love gratitude and prayers for comfort and peace With the permission of President Steven B Wright of the Bolivia La Paz Mission I share this special experience that came to him in a dream I saw these two elders dressed in white standing at the doors of a beautiful building They were greeting numerous people who also were dressed in white as they entered the building It was obvious from their dress that those who entered were Bolivians I envisioned the temple that will someday be built in Bolivia Elders Wilson and Ball were ushering those they had prepared to receive the gospel in the spirit world into the temple to witness the vicarious ordinances being performed in their behalf This dream has been a great comfort to me and has helped me to understand and accept their deaths This glimpse by President Wright of the work of redemption beyond mortality is consistent with the heavenly vision given to President Joseph F Smith more than seven decades ago He declared I beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation when they depart from mortal life continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel in the great world of the spirits D C 138 57 Trials and tribulations have confronted the Church ever since the beginning The Prophet Joseph Smith said Hell may pour forth its rage like the burning lava of Mount Vesuvius or of Etna or of the most terrible of the burning mountains and yet shall Mormonism stand Water fire truth and God are all realities Truth is Mormonism God is the author of it He is our shield It is by Him we received our birth It was by His voice that we were called to a dispensation of His Gospel in the beginning of the fullness of times It was by Him we received the Book of Mormon and it is by Him that we remain unto this day and by Him we shall remain if it shall be for our glory and in His Almighty name we are determined to endure tribulation as good soldiers unto the end Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith sel Joseph Fielding Smith Salt Lake City Deseret Book Co 1938 p 139 So far this year more than thirty seven thousand faithful missionaries have been instrumental in bringing tens of thousands of people to a knowledge of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ These new members have experienced a mighty change in their hearts and have humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God Alma 5 13 Our missionaries have not participated in this great work without serious challenges tribulations and difficulties Parents of missionaries have always known the risk of losing a loved one serving in the mission field due to accident or illness Now we must add to the risk of missionary service the possibility of acts of terrorism Terrorism is centuries old but perhaps has never before been so open and blatant nor had such extensive news coverage Terrorism has many victims They include the innocent and law abiding people residing in a troubled region who are striving to provide for their families and to do what is right Missionaries live among the peoples of the world and even with the protection of the members they also can become innocent victims of acts of violence We must not judge the people of any nation or region because of the irresponsible cowardly acts of terrorism perpetrated by a few Sometimes terrorists attack Church members or Church property because they believe mistakenly that the Church represents the interests of a country Contrary to such misguided beliefs The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has no past or present affiliation with any government agency of any country including the United States of America In genuine Christian kindness and loving concern missionaries and other Church members offer to all sincere and law abiding peoples nothing more or less than the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Sad experience has taught us that not all people accept these assurances of fact Therefore leaders and members must be prepared for any event that may occur in the future The increased visibility of the Church in the world brings a variety of new challenges However you parents and prospective missionaries have no reason to be fearful and to feel that serving a mission is unusually dangerous or risky Our records since 1981 reveal that the total number of missionaries who have lost their lives through accident illness or other causes is very small The life style of Latter day Saint missionaries before and during their missions contributes to their health and safety For example the death rate of young male missionaries from the United States serving worldwide is one fifth the rate of young males of comparable age living in Utah It is one seventh the rate of young males of comparable age in the general population of the United States I do not imply that missionary service is a guarantee of increased longevity but missionaries obviously have a much lower risk of death than others of comparable age The Church is making great efforts to safeguard the health and safety of missionaries by decreasing the likelihood of illness and accident In the past year a highly qualified team of LDS doctors visited many of the missions in developing nations and made important recommendations that have been adopted to improve missionary health We are doing and will continue to do all within our power to reduce any risks that could harm the missionaries However in a world of free agency the Church cannot eliminate all risk nor guarantee absolutely that a missionary never will be ill injured or harmed The Missionary Department employs six former mission presidents who are on 24 hour a day call to serve mission presidents and their missionaries They respond immediately with the resources of the Church to assure the well being of missionaries and their families When a problem occurs such as the recent unrest in Colombia the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve through the able leadership of the General Authority Area Presidencies monitor conditions daily and even hourly if necessary Be assured that the safety and protection of missionaries always is a paramount concern At the same time however the Church cannot retreat from areas of the world that are in turmoil unless absolutely necessary Brothers and sisters the charge from the Lord to go ye therefore and teach all nations is a difficult one to fulfill Matt 28 19 The battle to bring souls unto Christ began in the premortal world with the war in heaven See Rev 12 7 That same battle continues today in the conflict between right and wrong and between the gospel and false principles The members of the Church hold a frontline position in the contest for the souls of men The missionaries are on the battlefield fighting with the sword of truth to carry the glorious message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the peoples of the earth No war has ever been free of risk The prophecies of the last days lead me to believe that the intensity of the battle for the souls of men will increase and the risks will become greater as we draw closer to the second coming of the Lord Preparing ourselves and our families for the challenges of the coming years will require us to replace fear with faith We must be able to overcome the fear of enemies who oppose and threaten us The Lord has said Fear not little flock do good let earth and hell combine against you for if ye are built upon my rock they cannot prevail D C 6 34 When I visited the missionaries in Bolivia Peru and Ecuador immediately after the tragedy I was extremely impressed with the deep love our missionaries feel for the people they are called to teach Their intense desire to continue serving the precious people of their mission is beyond description Sometimes parents and family members understandably voice worry anxiety or even feel alarm about the safety of their missionary sons or daughters but rarely if ever do we hear the missionaries express such concerns They love and care deeply about the people they are serving and generally they want to continue in the service of the Lord These dedicated missionaries illustrate so powerfully for the rest of us that there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear 1 Jn 4 18 In many ways brothers and sisters the past sixty years in the Church have been relatively calm compared to the beginnings of the Restoration Persecutions and tribulations have been minimal Perhaps some of these recent events are a toughening process to help us learn how to shoulder and not shrink from our responsibilities to preach the gospel to all the peoples of the earth We parents need to begin early to prepare our children to have a strong fervent testimony of the gospel We must possess the faith the courage and the commitment that our pioneer forefathers had if we are to continue building up the kingdom of God on the earth Remember also that membership in the Church requires an understanding of the principle of sacrifice in the service of the Lord The Prophet Joseph Smith put it this way When a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has for the truth s sake not even withholding his life and believing before God that he has been called to make this sacrifice because he seeks to do his will he can obtain the faith necessary for him to lay hold on eternal life Lectures on Faith Salt Lake City Deseret Book Co 1985 p 69 You remember what the Prophet Joseph wrote to Mr John Wentworth the editor of the Chicago Democrat newspaper The Standard of Truth has been erected no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing persecutions may rage mobs may combine armies may assemble calumny may defame but the truth of God will go forth boldly nobly and independent till it has penetrated every continent visited every clime swept every country and sounded in every ear till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done History of the Church 4 540 The Lord has not yet said the work is done so we must continue moving forward It is good to know that during the four years that President Ezra Taft Benson has presided over the Church more than eighty thousand missionaries have been set apart to proclaim the glad tidings of the Restoration The work will continue to grow and prosper throughout the world In recent years the Lord s servants have unlocked the door and opened the work in the German Democratic Republic Poland Hungary and Yugoslavia They have opened many nations of Africa including Nigeria Ghana Zaire Liberia Sierra Leone Swaziland Ivory Coast and Namibia and Papua New Guinea Thirteen nations and territories have been opened for missionary work in just the past four years Many others will be opened to the preaching of the gospel Truly no unhallowed hand can stop the sacred work of proclaiming life and salvation to all nations and peoples but this work will not continue without challenges and risks The work of sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in all the world will require knowledge faith sacrifice and the best efforts of every member of the Church As the Prophet Joseph Smith said to the Saints in Nauvoo in 1842 Shall we not go on in so great a cause Courage and on on to the victory D C 128 22 Today the leaders of the Church echo these words of the Prophet Joseph Brothers and sisters the missionaries need our faith and prayers Pray fervently every day for their safety and protection for this is one very important way we all can support them in accomplishing their essential assignment of proclaiming the gospel to all the world I bear testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God We are engaged in his work I testify that through the faith and prayers of all members of the Church we will continue moving this great work forward to the final victory In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
This has been another wonderful conference brothers and sisters I am sure we all appreciate the inspired and timely messages we have heard They have been translated simultaneously into twenty nine languages many of which have been broadcast via satellite and television to millions of people The wonder of television causes me to believe that Philo T Farnsworth back in 1927 must surely have been inspired of the Lord to develop this remarkable medium of communication As you know Brother Farnsworth was a member of the Church Applying his scientific skills he brought to the world this marvelous invention which I believe is to be used for the primary purpose of furthering the work of the Lord In the past sixty years television has become a major industry in the world It is estimated that more than 750 million television sets are owned by people living in 160 countries Approximately 2 5 billion people view television broadcasting every day Most of us recognize both the many benefits and the many challenges that come from television in our modern fast paced world Some of the benefits besides listening to the teaching of the gospel we can receive by merely touching a button include receiving instant reports of local and world events and updates on weather watching fantasy exploring geography living history enjoying good theater dance and music and experiencing culture from almost every country in the world For these kinds of programs we praise the industry Unfortunately however far too much programming is not wholesome and uplifting but is violent degrading and destructive to moral values This kind of television offends the Spirit of the Lord therefore I express a word of warning and caution about such programming Good families face very significant challenges in controlling the use of television and videotapes in their homes I agree with Dr Victor B Cline when he said I am convinced by a vast amount of research that the images fantasies and models which we are repeatedly exposed to in advertisements entertainment novels motion pictures and other works of art can and do affect the self image and later the behavior of nearly all young people and adults too Address at Tidewater Assembly on Family Life Norfolk Virginia On another occasion Dr Cline said that the mental diet is as important as the nutritional diet The amount of violence a child sees at 7 predicts how violent he will be at 17 27 and 37 Children s minds are like banks whatever you put in you get back 10 years later with interest He said that violent television teaches children step by step how to commit violent acts and it desensitizes them to the horror of such behavior and to the feelings of victims Dr Cline said that America is suffering from an explosion of interpersonal violence like we have never seen before The violence is because of violence in our entertainment See Therapist says children who view TV violence tend to become violent Deseret News 24 Mar 1989 p 2B Some may be surprised to know that in the average American home the television set is on just under seven hours each day and more than sixty six million Americans who are under age nineteen live in these homes A recent magazine article included this statement Once television s window on the world mirrored solid family ties heroes drawn in bright primary colors and a society of permanence and belonging Now it s clear that our TV shows are showing quite a different picture In fact it s arguable that television is no longer a mere window on our world but the value setter itself Another View of the Window Triangle Publications n d p 3 Allow me to share highlights of some alarming findings from research studies conducted over the past eight to ten years on the effects of television when watched more than two hours a day without the careful selection of programs Before television children played together more often played outdoors more spent more time being creative and inventive and read more Parents and children spent more time together talked together more shared more joint projects and chores and ate more meals together See Ellen B De Franco TV On Off Better Family Use of Television Santa Monica Calif Goodyear Publishing Co 1980 pp 5 6 Television is psychologically addictive Ibid p 4 Television is a physically passive activity and generally discourages creative play It can encourage a certain kind of passivity which leads to a show me or entertain me orientation by children See Television and Behavior Rockville Md National Institute of Mental Health 1987 pp 45 46 Television tends to overpower and desensitize a child s sense of sympathy for suffering See Kate Moody Growing Up on Television The TV Effect A Report to Parents New York Times Books 1980 pp 91 92 Some children lose the ability to learn from reality because life s experiences are more complicated than those seen on the screen Teachers and parents therefore suffer by comparison when they cannot solve problems in thirty to sixty minutes See Ben Logan and Kate Moody eds Television Awareness Training The Viewer s Guide for Family and Community Nashville Abingdon 1979 p 43 Volumes of research data show the detrimental effects of television but I just say that television and videocassette viewing by youngsters has a significant impact on their behavior We must not take lightly the confession of a recently executed killer on the impact pornography and violence in media had on his life The Apostle Paul warned that men can become past feeling giving themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness Eph 4 19 In Proverbs we read As a man thinketh so is he Prov 23 7 A mind exposed to violence and immorality cannot escape the negative impact of such exposure President Gordon B Hinckley said A survey of influential television writers and executives in Hollywood has shown that they are far less religious than the general public While nearly all of the 104 Hollywood professionals interviewed had a religious background 45 percent now say they have no religion and of the other 55 percent only 7 percent say they attend a religious service as much as once a month This group has had a major role in shaping the shows whose themes and stars have become staples in our popular culture Los Angeles Times 19 Feb 1983 part 2 page 5 These are the people TV script writers and executives who through the medium of entertainment are educating us in the direction of their own standards which in many cases are diametrically opposed to the standards of the gospel Ensign Nov 1983 pp 45 46 A Time magazine article states This upsurge in openness has been linked by some critics to cutbacks in the network departments of standards and practices the censors who review shows and commercials for offensive material The ranks of these watchdogs were drastically reduced from a peak of 75 to 80 per network during the 1970s to 35 to 40 today at ABC and fewer than 30 each at CBS and NBC Where Are the Censors 12 Dec 1988 p 95 Televised violence has become so pervasive that the average high school student by graduation has seen eighteen thousand murders and many other acts of violence and sin This being the case today more parental review and monitoring is needed to protect our families from the current flood of TV violence and the effect it has on us Randal A Wright in his book Families in Danger wrote It is possible to trace the decline in American television from its original programs As an example a prime time 7 00 to 10 00 P M schedule check going back thirty years found that in 1955 no violent crime oriented programs were offered By 1986 twenty nine hours of violent programs were being offered Salt Lake City Deseret Book Co 1988 pp 45 46 I believe that the number of violent programs has increased substantially since 1986 Mr Wright continued Not only is violence increasing on TV but every form of immorality vice and corruption is also being paraded before our family s eyes in ever increasing amounts Ask yourself if the same kinds of sexually related scenes and messages of all too many programs of today were found in the programs of twenty years ago We are being exposed to growing amounts of inappropriate material if we choose to watch TV without being selective Ibid p 46 In the Church we often state the couplet Be in the world but not of the world As we observe television shows that make profanity violence and infidelity commonplace and even glamorous we often wish we could lock out the world in some way and isolate our families from it all Perhaps the proper response to outrageous behavior is outrage or more to the point the proper response to outrageous television is outrage I express my own and this Church s disappointment disagreement and even outrage with television that turns our attention and sometimes our inclinations toward violence self serving greed profanity disrespect for traditional values sexual promiscuity and deviance Nephi predicted that in our day Satan would rage in the hearts of the children of men and stir them up to anger against that which is good 2 Ne 28 20 Satan s evil use of television contributes to the increased wickedness in our society Perhaps we should state the couplet previously mentioned as two separate admonitions First Be in the world Be involved be informed Try to be understanding and tolerant and to appreciate diversity Make meaningful contributions to society through service and involvement Second Be not of the world Do not follow wrong paths or bend to accommodate or accept what is not right We should strive to change the corrupt and immoral tendencies in television and in society by keeping things that offend and debase out of our homes In spite of all of the wickedness in the world and in spite of all the opposition to good that we find on every hand we should not try to take ourselves or our children out of the world Jesus said The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven or yeast Matt 13 33 We are to lift the world and help all to rise above the wickedness that surrounds us The Savior prayed to the Father I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil John 17 15 Members of the Church need to influence more than we are influenced We should work to stem the tide of sin and evil instead of passively being swept along by it We each need to help solve the problem rather than avoid or ignore it I like this simple little poem All the water in the worldNo matter how it triedCould never sink the smallest shipUnless it got inside All the evil of the worldAnd every kind of sinCould never damn a human soulUnless we let it in We can live in the world brothers and sisters without letting the world into us We have the gospel message that can carry men and women buoyantly through the mist of darkness 1 Ne 8 23 to the source of all light We can raise children who have been taught to discern and to make personal righteous decisions The Lord does not need a society that hides and isolates itself from the world Rather he needs stalwart individuals and families who live exemplary lives in the world and demonstrate that joy and fulfillment come not of the world but through the spirit and the doctrine of Jesus Christ Now what can we as individuals and families do to reverse the negative trends of television Let me review with you some suggestions Research data indicate that families that limit television viewing to a maximum of two hours a day of carefully selected programs may see the following significant changes in family relationships Value setting will be taught and reinforced by the family Families will learn how to establish values and how to reason together Relationships between parents and youth will increase in families Homework will be completed with less pressure of time Personal conversations will increase substantially Children s imaginations will come back to life Each family member will become a discriminating selector and evaluator of programs Parents can become family leaders again Good reading habits may be substituted for television viewing Brothers and sisters we can write to local radio and television stations and to cable and national networks to express our concerns The sponsors and advertisers who pay for programs and advertising that are offensive would most likely appreciate hearing from us also In my opinion we must make our influence felt by joining with other concerned people who oppose television programming that tears down and destroys the values that have made our families and our countries strong Latter day Saints are not alone in this concern Many individuals churches and other organizations are raising their voices Let us join with them brothers and sisters to persuade TV script writers executives and sponsors to use their talents and resources to help build a better and safer world President George Bush in his inaugural address called for a kinder face of the nation and a gentler face of the world See Investor s Daily 23 Jan 1989 p 11 Let it begin by a kinder and gentler television throughout the world The prophet Mormon said that each of us is given the Spirit of Christ to know good from evil everything that invites us to do good is of God On the other hand anything that persuades us to do evil is of the devil for he and those who follow him persuade no one to do good See Moro 7 16 18 This simple test will guide us in judging television and other media programs May the Lord bless us and help us protect ourselves our families and the spirit of our homes and help us improve our world through working for improved television programming I leave you my testimony that we have only one sure way to secure our homes and our families and that is through learning and living the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ May the Lord bless you and help you prevent anything of an evil nature from entering your homes I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters the topic I wish to address is one about which the Brethren are deeply concerned I have titled my remarks The Hand of Fellowship In the New Testament we read that Peter the head of the Church after the Savior s resurrection and ascension was informed in a vision that the gospel is for all mankind He said Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons But in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him Acts 10 34 35 This same message appears in the Book of Mormon and in the Doctrine and Covenants Every soul is to have an opportunity to hear and then accept or reject the gospel In the Church we use the word fellowship to describe our efforts 1 to encourage less active members to return to full activity and 2 to help new converts make the transition into the Church following baptism I believe those meanings are valid but to me the word fellowship has a much broader connotation I believe we members do not have the option to extend the hand of fellowship only to relatives close friends certain Church members and those selected nonmembers who express an interest in the Church Limiting or withholding our fellowship seems to me to be contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ The Savior offered the effects of his atoning sacrifice to all mankind He said Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God D C 18 10 Can we justify doing less Let me give you a few examples that illustrate my message Near the end of his earthly ministry the resurrected Jesus instructed his disciples with these words Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you Matt 28 19 20 That instruction is in force today and is the mandate for General Authorities missionaries and other members of the Church to travel to the four corners of the world teaching the gospel Proclaiming the gospel to all mankind is a fundamental part of the mission of the Church As those of you know who have supported full time missionaries the Church devotes very substantial resources in time and money to missionary work This big world is filled with billions of people Today more than 35 700 full time missionaries are combing the earth looking for those of our Father s children who will listen to the message of the Restoration These dedicated servants of the Lord are serving in 221 missions and are teaching the gospel in 64 different languages We expect that approximately 245 000 converts will be baptized during 1988 This number is impressive however approximately that same number of people are being born in the world every day In the missionary training centers we teach the missionaries that they must have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ They are taught that they need to develop genuinely warm personal caring relationships with those whom they meet They must learn to listen with understanding and to show sincere sensitivity to the interests and concerns of those they teach As missionaries teach the doctrines they need to find out what their contacts think and feel so they can clarify misunderstandings ease doubts resolve concerns and provide encouragement The warm sincere spirit of the missionaries is essential to help nonmembers feel and recognize the Spirit of the Lord because the Spirit is the power that leads to conversion Brothers and sisters we must ever keep in mind that missionary work throughout the world requires great sacrifice and all of this sacrifice effort and exhaustive preparation of missionaries may be in vain if those who accept the gospel do not receive a loving and warm welcome by the members of the Church We know from years of experience that the first contacts new converts have with members in wards or branches are critical to the conversion process Recently several of the Brethren were discussing how we accept and welcome newcomers Two of them shared experiences with me Elder Devere Harris of the First Quorum of the Seventy told me of a recent visit he made to a long established ward in Utah He said I entered there as a stranger and tried every way that I knew to strike up a conversation or to say hello or to be kind or to be greeted or to be known Everyone ignored me nobody would speak to me no one Finally a man recognized me He said Oh Elder Harris The bishop turned around and said What did you say The brother said This is Elder Harris of the First Quorum of the Seventy Well things changed It wasn t long before I was asked to sit on the stand they wondered if I wouldn t like to bear my testimony After the meeting many people shook my hand As I left I thought What a tragedy A gray haired man who was unknown walks into a meeting Nobody recognizes him nobody says hello nobody is kind Then because of his Church position everybody changes and wants to be friendly The second story involves two sisters who live two thousand miles from each other Each was taught the missionary discussions by the full time missionaries Each felt the confirming witness of the Spirit and was baptized Both were single adults in their early twenties One sister attended church meetings met the bishop developed friendships with members who invited her into their homes Ward members made her feel welcome and wanted She was given a Church calling immediately after her baptism and she continued to learn and live gospel principles while associating with ward and stake members She participated continually serving in various ward stake and general Church callings In time she married in the temple and she maintains her standing as a member in full fellowship The other sister after receiving the witness of the Spirit never met her bishop personally She received no visits by home teachers or visiting teachers and was given no Church calling For several weeks she attended Sunday ward meetings but she was mostly ignored In due course the missionaries who had taught her left the area and her interest in the gospel waned without the support of members She was not remembered and nourished Moro 6 4 Soon she stopped attending church services resumed her old friendships and life style and married a nonmember Today she is a fine productive contributing citizen in her community and a loving conscientious wife and mother But she does not enjoy the rich blessings that come from full fellowship in the Church Recently the Church News featured two older sister missionaries who exemplify the attributes of love and caring for others while serving on their missions in Duchesne Utah The stake president credited these sisters with bringing a spirit of warmth and friendship to his stake In fact the teaching and fellowshipping efforts of these sisters have helped change the attitude of the whole stake The work of the Lord is more effectively coming together and influencing everyone including the less active as well as nonmembers The stake president said that in small farming communities the activation of a less active family has a big effect on others He expects twelve to fifteen families to become active and go through the temple this year Brothers and sisters we must ever keep in mind the time effort and other resources that missionaries and others spend to find and teach one of our Father s children Surely every one of us ought to be alert looking for ways to be of service to the newcomer We might ask ourselves how the newcomers in our wards would be treated if we were the only ones they ever met Every member of the Church should foster the attributes of warmth sincerity and love for the newcomers as the missionaries are taught to do Brothers and sisters we members must help with the conversion process by making our wards and branches friendly places with no exclusivity where all people feel welcome and comfortable You bishops have been given many who can help you foster fellowship Teach the children youth and adults that being warm and friendly are Christlike qualities In your ward council meetings consider ways to improve the feeling of fellowship in your ward Be sure the missionaries introduce you to every investigator before he or she is baptized Assign someone to greet at the doors paying special attention to newcomers and guests On occasion use priesthood and Relief Society meetings to teach home and visiting teachers how to fellowship all who live within the ward Take advantage of the flexibility you have in using high priests and stake and full time missionaries to lead the less active and new converts into full fellowship In the true spirit of shepherding bishoprics can help create a friendly atmosphere by mingling with members when they are gathering together Brothers and sisters my message is urgent because we need to retain in full fellowship many more of the new converts and return to activity many more of the less active I urge you to increase the spirit of friendship and pure Christian fellowship in your neighborhoods A new convert or recently activated member should feel the warmth of being wanted and being welcomed into full fellowship of the Church Members and leaders of the Church should nurture and love them as Jesus would In addition to welcoming and accepting recent converts and less active members we need to reach out and extend our friendship to others regardless of whether they are interested in the gospel or not We must not be too selective in identifying those we feel are worthy or appreciative of our attention The spirit of true Christian fellowship must include everyone Our understanding of the gospel should help us see clearly that all people are our brothers and sisters children of our Heavenly Father Perhaps more of us could emulate this example Years ago while walking up Main Street with his father Elder LeGrand Richards then the Presiding Bishop of the Church tipped his hat and greeted everyone Upon arrival at their destination President George F Richards then the President of the Council of the Twelve said Son do you know all those people Bishop Richards responded Yes Daddy I know them all all but their names During his earthly ministry Jesus posed this challenging question For if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same Matt 5 46 This teaching is clear We should extend our love far beyond family close friends and fellow members of the Church Our hearts should be open to everyone We can share the love of Christ in simple acts For example the warmth of a radiant smile and friendly greeting can go far in smoothing the way for good neighborly relations Jesus posed another question And if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so Matt 5 47 Some years ago a friend of mine was doing some work one morning on his garage roof He looked down and saw a load of cement being delivered to his nonmember neighbor He could see that the neighbor could use some help My friend came down from his roof and without being asked carried his own cement finishing tools across the street and began helping with the job Having had experience doing cement work he and his help turned out to be most welcome Although the neighbor had expressed a dislike for members of the Church he showed genuine appreciation for this one by the end of the day This was the beginning of a long and lasting friendship Jesus gave us a new commandment and said it would identify his disciples A new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another John 13 34 35 As disciples of Christ we need to feel genuine charity for one another As we do new light will come into our own lives This charity is essential in missionary work but we must never allow ourselves to treat our neighbors only as potential converts We have had the sad experience of seeing members of the Church who attempted to convert their neighbors and friends and when they did not respond withdrew their friendship and neighborliness We must not be so anxious to share the gospel that we become insensitive to the feelings of others I encourage you to build personal meaningful relationships with your nonmember friends and acquaintances Interest in the gospel may come later as a natural extension of a good friendship Invitations to participate in gospel related activities often will strengthen relationships with acquaintances If they are not interested in the gospel we should show unconditional love through acts of service and kindness and never imply that we see an acquaintance only as a potential convert Members must understand that when a nonmember declines one invitation to investigate the gospel he has not necessarily rejected the gospel Let us adhere to the counsel of the Apostle Paul and be no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God Eph 2 19 Despite some well publicized criticism to the contrary I believe Church members want to be good friends and neighbors wherever they live but some are shy and overly cautious This can appear to be clannish We must not reserve our kindness and affection only for our fellow members We must be sensitive and not oblivious to the feelings of those whose views may differ from ours Considering the early history of the Church in these latter days unkindness or indifference toward others should be abhorrent to members of the Church I bear my testimony that God is no respecter of persons we should follow his example in all of our associations with our fellowmen I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God the Savior of all mankind He loves all men and looks to each one of us to do the same May we so do I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Brothers and sisters this is a beautiful time of year with spring beginning to burst forth in many parts of the world bringing all of its colors scents and cheerful sounds The miracle of the changing seasons with the reawakening and rebirth in nature inspires feelings of love and reverence within us for God s marvelous creative handiwork The Easter season is a good time for people everywhere to appreciate the wonders of nature and give thanks to the Creator of this beautiful world Men and women in all parts of the world have a desperate need to take time from their demanding routines of everyday life and to quietly observe God s miracles taking place all around them Think of what would happen if all of us took time to look carefully at the wonders of nature that surround us and devoted ourselves to learning more about this world that God created for us My family and I recently had a simple but impressive experience with one of God s creations I gave my wife Barbara a dozen roses for a valentine They were a delicate shade of peach in color and had a rich scent Barbara put them in a vase and placed them on the table in our family room As the days passed the family watched the blossoms unfold from buds to full flower As I watched this miracle I became curious about roses I was amazed to learn from a botanist friend that there are thousands of different varieties of roses Inside each rose is a giant storehouse of genetic coding that develops a seed or a slip into roots stems thorns leaves colors and blooms Each rose is a compact chemical processing factory Using sunlight the green leaves take carbon dioxide from the air and replace it with oxygen which we breathe When other chemicals within the plant react with sunlight it produces starch that becomes food As you know this process is called photosynthesis and without it the earth s atmosphere would soon be devoid of oxygen and most living things would disappear from the earth My friend told me that the chemical energy and the electrical energy our brains were using at that very moment were once sunlight that was absorbed by the chlorophyll in green vegetation we previously had eaten This experience led me to consider the myriad forms of plant and animal life that thrive in astounding balance upon the earth My esteem for our little roses took on an element of wonder and reverence I pondered the power of the creative genius who lovingly provided such marvels for his children I thought then how important it is for every human soul to see and appreciate the glory and grandeur of God in everything about us Into my mind came the words and message of a beautiful hymn When thru the woods and forest glades I wander And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees When I look down from lofty mountain grandeurAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee How great thou art How great thou art I felt a deep reverence for both the creation and the Creator Reverence may be defined as a profound respect mingled with love and awe Other words that add to our understanding of reverence include gratitude honor veneration and admiration The root word revere also implies an element of fear Thus reverence might be understood to mean an attitude of profound respect and love with a desire to honor and show gratitude with a fear of breaking faith or offending In the book of Moses we read And behold all things have their likeness and all things are created and made to bear record of me both things which are temporal and things which are spiritual things which are in the heavens above and things which are on the earth and things which are in the earth and things which are under the earth both above and beneath all things bear record of me Moses 6 63 Truly the heavens and the earth and all things in them evidence the handiwork of God their Creator In the Book of Mormon we learn of Korihor an anti Christ who was brought to the Prophet Alma He asked for a sign of God s existence before he would believe But Alma said unto him Thou hast had signs enough will ye tempt your God Will ye say Show unto me a sign when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren and also all the holy prophets The scriptures are laid before thee yea and all things denote there is a God yea even the earth and all things that are upon the face of it yea and its motion yea and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator Alma 30 44 These eternal evidences continue to testify to us today Astronauts viewing the earth from space have stated how incredibly beautiful it is and how alive it appears United States Senator Jake Garn wrote of his experience in space It is impossible for me to describe the beauty of the earth It is a breathtaking awe inspiring spiritual experience to view the earth from space while traveling at twenty five times the speed of sound I could also look into the blackness of the vacuum of space and see billions of stars and galaxies millions of light years away The universe is so vast as to be impossible to comprehend But I did comprehend the hand of God in all things I felt his presence throughout my seven days in space I know that God created this earth and the universe I know that we are his children wherever we live on the earth without regard to our nationality or the color of our skin Most important I know that God lives and is the Creator of us all letter to M Russell Ballard 3 March 1988 Again the words of the hymn came to mind O Lord my God when I in awesome wonderConsider all the worlds thy hands have made I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder Thy pow r thruout the universe displayed Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee How great thou art How great thou art The psalmist wrote When I consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained What is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour Ps 8 3 5 The Lord gave an answer to the psalmist s question it is recorded in the book of Moses For mine own purpose have I made these things And by the word of my power have I created them For behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 31 32 39 When we look to see the evidence of creation all around us from a grain of sand to the majestic planets we begin to realize that we are the greatest of all God s creations we are created in his image I was joyfully reminded of this fact three weeks ago when our twenty fourth grandchild was born I was again filled with wonder and love to hold this precious infant in my arms to contemplate the miracle of birth and to see a child born into mortality who had come so recently from the presence of our Father in Heaven The gift of new life brings a profound feeling of reverence Parents and other family members are drawn closer together Even little children sense a feeling of awe and wonder They want to hold the baby touch it run their hands over its warm soft head or extend a finger for it to grasp and hold Welcoming this new little spirit into our family circle brought home once more to me an incredible truth I realized again that God created the earth in all its magnificent glory not as an end in itself but for us his children Indeed we are his children his offspring and he is the Father of our spirits We sometimes feel great respect and reverence for creative genius as expressed in great art or music How much more should we revere the power and majesty of our Divine Creator We may stand in awe of man s creations of beautiful buildings or bridges But remember the Apostle Paul s words to the Hebrews He who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house For every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God Heb 3 3 4 Those who feel no reverence for the creations and the divine attributes of God likely will have little appreciation for other sacred things Such a lack of veneration for God s creations may diminish until a person becomes totally insensitive to the feelings of others This I am afraid is the condition in some parts of the world When we consider people who are irreverent we may think of those who lack manners sensitivity and courtesy and who show little or no respect for the finer things or for sacred things Perhaps some lack reverence for life and for their fellowmen because they do not understand who they are and what they have the potential to become God expresses his love for us by providing the guidance we need to progress and reach our potential Perhaps a simple story will illustrate this point Recently a young man purchased a used computer but could not get it to work properly Soon he became discouraged His temper grew short and he threatened the inanimate object with painful destruction unless its performance improved A wise father intervened and took his son to a local vendor where they obtained an instruction manual After all who would know more about a complex computer than the person or company that created it Who would know most about its capacity and potential Who would better know the safeguards required to avoid damaging or ruining this fine instrument Soon the boy enjoyed the full potential of his computer by working within the guidelines given in the instruction book provided by its creator Likewise in our lives he who knows most about us our potential and our eternal possibilities has given us divine counsel and commandments in his instruction manuals the holy scriptures When we understand and follow these instructions our lives have purpose and meaning We learn that our Maker loves us and desires our happiness In an incomparable manifestation of this divine love for us he sent his Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved John 3 16 17 Jesus was born into mortality He led a perfect life and in so doing marked the path for us to follow He taught his disciples I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life John 8 12 His gospel is a gospel of love love for God and love for one another He directs us to follow his example Our discipleship is measured by how well we comply A new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another John 13 34 35 Can you imagine what an impact following this instruction would have on society today Many people I fear never come to understand that the commandments of God are for our benefit and that as we sow so shall we reap Our return to our Heavenly Father is through his Son Jesus Christ Jesus told his disciples I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me John 14 6 He instructed us to keep his commandments if we love him John 14 15 He taught further that He that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him John 14 21 In the atonement and the resurrection of Jesus Christ we can glimpse the reality of his divine mission to redeem all who will come unto him and will honor and reverence God our Eternal Father We may begin to understand the depths of Christ s love for us when we consider that he was willing to atone and suffer the pain for our sins which suffering caused him even God the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore and to suffer both body and spirit D C 19 18 Nevertheless he gave glory to his Father and partook and finished his preparations unto the children of men D C 19 19 The crowning words of the inspired hymn continue And when I think that God his Son not sparing Sent him to die I scarce can take it in That on the cross my burden gladly bearingHe bled and died to take away my sin Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee How great thou art How great thou art Brothers and sisters on this Easter Sunday let us give special thanks to God for the atonement and resurrection of his beloved Son Jesus Christ For in him by him and through him this temporary mortal condition can be made into a permanent perfect existence for which words cannot express our joy To truly reverence the Creator we must appreciate his creations We need to plan to take time to observe the marvels of nature Today we can easily become surrounded by brick buildings and asphalt surfaces that shelter us from real life around us Plan to share with your family the miracle of buds changing to fragrant blossoms Take time to sit on a hillside and feel the tranquillity of the evening when the sun casts its last golden glow over the horizon Take time to smell the roses All the marvels of nature are glimpses of his divine power and expressions of his love Yet the greatest of all miracles awaits us It will occur when by his power we will come forth from death and the grave to a new world that will not pass away where if we are worthy we will be with him and our Father in Heaven forever and ever With humility but with firm conviction we declare to all the world that we know for a surety that God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son live We know that they visited the Prophet Joseph Smith in the spring of 1820 They spoke to Joseph and through him they revealed wonderful true doctrines and restored the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ that had been lost from the world We invite all men and women everywhere to know of the restoration of the gospel for in so doing they will develop a deep reverence and love for God his beloved Son Jesus Christ and their creations I bear testimony that true reverence will bring peace joy and happiness to us all In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
This has been a wonderful conference brothers and sisters I pray that my few remarks will not detract from the spirit we have enjoyed During this past year the Area Presidencies in South America became concerned with the dependency of the Church there upon financial resources from Church headquarters Wisely these Brethren could see that future needs would require more funds than Church headquarters could provide The Area Presidencies met with their Regional Representatives and stake presidents to counsel together on steps that would help the Church in South America become more self sufficient They studied ways to decrease costs and at the same time increase the participation of their people They agreed that greatly simplified buildings would fully meet the needs of the Church They found ways for their members to donate more labor decreasing the amount of cash required for construction In seeking to become more self sufficient the people have incorporated the principle of sacrifice into their lives and have increased their faith The Prophet Joseph Smith said A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation for from the first existence of man the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things Lectures on Faith 6 7 As the Saints work to become completely self sufficient something very special happens that goes far beyond decreasing costs For example when the Church leaders in South America turned their attention to decreasing the cost of missionary service the Lord blessed them with a simple but marvelous idea the members could provide the noon meal each day for the full time missionaries This was a task the Saints in South America could do and one that would strengthen both the members and missionaries It proved to be the means for the members in this part of the world to perfect the Saints and to proclaim the gospel two parts of the mission of the Church Reporting on the results of putting this idea into action one stake president said I had a meeting with the mission president and we discussed the idea that our members could provide the noon meal for the missionaries I asked my bishops for time in their sacrament meetings to explain the basic idea I explained the blessings that they their children their neighborhood and the stake would receive In my own ward we saw an unexpected result of our members sacrifice Attendance at sacrament meetings climbed from eighty to ninety people a week to nearly one hundred fifty now The number of baptisms has increased from 1 or 2 a month to nearly 12 a month General activity has increased in our stake and we feel a sweeter spirit in every ward My bishop told of an experience two young children had who are members of the Church but whose parents are not These children raised their hands in support of the program and then went home to tell their parents that they had incurred an obligation to feed the missionaries As a result the parents are now hearing the missionary discussions and attending Church meetings We expect them to be baptized very soon One bishop reported to his stake president that he did not have enough active members to provide lunch for the missionaries every day The wise stake president suggested that the bishop invite less active members of the ward to participate Much to the surprise of the bishop many of the less active members were pleased to have the missionaries come to their homes for a noon meal In fact many of these less active members were anxious to share with the missionaries the stories of their conversions More often than not they would get out photographs of the missionaries who baptized them This simple idea is bringing many unexpected blessings to the Church As the members share their food with the missionaries the missionaries bring into homes the special spirit that only they carry blessing both the members and the missionaries Many less active members are returning to full fellowship and many more members are becoming involved in missionary work because of this simple expression of love and service How often brothers and sisters we can solve seemingly large problems through relatively simple means Let me share a few experiences that have resulted from members and missionaries working together An elder wrote Because we were able to have lunch with an inactive family they are now back into full activity in the Church When we ate with them they recognized the importance of prayer before each meal A wonderful spirit prevails in their home now They are not only active again but we baptized a member of the family and later baptized their neighbors as well all because they invited us to share their food Another missionary wrote The mother of a poor family came to me and my companion and asked us when we were going to eat at her home Knowing of the family s humble circumstances I talked to the branch president He said Elders this family has taught us a lot by their example of humility It is a great privilege to have them in our branch They are poor but they really want to participate We want you to go If their food isn t enough come by my house afterwards and eat with us In Bolivia a young mother with four small children expressed her testimony saying I am so grateful for the privilege of having the missionaries come into our home It is a pleasure to feed them even though I fear that sometimes we do not have enough for them I need to add here that members everywhere in the world have the same fear She continues However I am so thankful for this opportunity for you see my four little ones wait anxiously for the day to come when the missionaries eat with us When it is our turn two handsome young men dressed in white shirts wearing ties their hair cut neatly come into our home They are full of the gospel light They play with the children They tell us about their wonderful missionary experiences They are gentlemen courteous and kind After about an hour with us they leave to do the work of the Lord What parents would not rejoice to have sons like the two missionaries for whom an older widow volunteered to provide lunch After a few visits they stopped on the way to her home and bought a bouquet of flowers to give to her as a token of thanks for the lunches When they gave the flowers to her the sister looked shocked and then began to cry The elders thought they had done something wrong and began to apologize The widow stopped them and said that no one had ever given her flowers during her entire life not even her husband when he was alive She beamed with delight during the lunch and then asked the elders to wait one more minute She presented them with the name and address of one of her best friends and asked them to please teach the friend s family The family accepted the gospel wholeheartedly and proved to be the best family baptism those two missionaries had Perhaps these words of one of our faithful mission presidents sum it all up The self sufficiency effort has been a blessing to our mission not only because we have decreased the average missionary cost by forty eight dollars per month but because of the relationships our elders and sisters have been able to develop with the members and nonmembers Many experiences have lead to member reactivations and to nonmember baptisms The members are fed spiritually and have greater love for the missionaries Up to this point not one single problem has developed The president continues I have wondered if Alma s experience is any different from what we see happening between the Peruvian Saints and the missionaries From Alma we read And as Alma entered the city he was an hungered and he said to a man Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat And the man said unto him I am a Nephite and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision Thou shalt receive Therefore go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house And it came to pass that the man received him into his house and the man was called Amulek and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma Alma 8 19 21 Something special happens to an individual or to a Church unit when the people become more independent and self reliant They feel more confident positive and assured and they reflect these feelings in their actions Last March as you remember devastating rock and mud slides engulfed six small towns in the mountains east of Lima Peru All of these towns were within the Lima Peru San Luis Stake The slide left 25 000 people homeless Eighteen LDS families lost their homes completely and 198 other families were left in dire need of food clothing and medical supplies The day after the slides one member of the stake presidency and two other Church members waded through waist high mud and debris for five kilometers to assess the damage They found that more than three hundred people members and nonmembers had taken refuge in the Chosica chapel The following day the stake presidency called a meeting of their eleven bishops and branch presidents They made many assignments to furnish needed supplies They asked each ward and branch to furnish work teams to go to the homes of members and help them clean up The stake presidency resolved to handle the problem without seeking help from outside stakes They soon found that they could not handle it all alone They went to their Regional Representative and asked him to coordinate economic help from other stakes in the region The Saints of Peru rallied together As an example the Iquitos stake sent thirteen crates of clothing each weighing thirty kilos about sixty six pounds Other stakes and wards donated food bedding and mattresses Selling quilts and refreshments young women raised more than three hundred dollars One young priest a senior at his high school in Lima led a group of twenty eight of his classmates all nonmembers to Chosica to help with the cleanup The stake Relief Society presidency visited the area frequently and instructed the sisters in classes on hygiene sanitation nutrition and how to organize family living in a tent The stakes did not intend to seek assistance from the general welfare funds of the Church Stake leaders called in all fast offering reserves from their wards and branches They asked stake members to participate in a special fast on 29 March 1987 to raise funds that would help cover the expenses Some bore tender testimonies Let me share just two Sister Guadalupe a nonmember lost everything Then in the shelter of a little room in our chapel she gave birth to a baby boy She stated that the Lord had helped her escape She learned that everything of the world is temporary and can be lost She thanked the branch and the Church for opening its doors to her and for the assistance she received Sister Leonora de Contreras a Relief Society president said she knew the gospel was true She expressed thanks for her husband who holds the priesthood and is a pillar of strength The catastrophe destroyed the fruits of their lifetime of labor in less than thirty minutes She recalled the words of their son who is serving in the Peru Trujillo Mission As he left home he said to her Mami whatever happens if you need help ask the Lord and stay close to the Brethren She expressed appreciation to stake leaders for their assistance Brothers and sisters I realize that similar reports could come from other parts of the world The principles of sacrifice self reliance and pure love in action apply the same everywhere I refer to South America only because my present assignment takes me there and gives me firsthand experience in that land We have a long way to go in South America to become fully self sufficient but we are on the way and the Lord is blessing our efforts I am so grateful to the Lord for the leaders and other members in the Church both men and women who are filled with a faith that makes them willing to sacrifice for the building up of the kingdom of God Such Saints truly feel and live the principle that King Benjamin taught to the Nephites When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God Mosiah 2 17 Brothers and sisters how can every member enjoy the thrill and the blessing that comes from making a sacrifice to help the work The answer is very simple as are most answers in the Church Every member of the Church can pay a full honest tithing and can attend tithing settlement The Lord said Verily now is a day of sacrifice and a day for the tithing of my people D C 64 23 Let me remind you of President Spencer W Kimball s statement on fast offerings Sometimes he said we have been a bit penurious and figured that we had for breakfast one egg and that cost so many cents and then we give that to the Lord I think that when we are affluent as many of us are that we ought to be very very generous I think we should give instead of the amount we saved by our two meals of fasting perhaps much much more ten times more where we are in a position to do it in Conference Report Apr 1974 p 184 Every member can give a generous fast offering Brothers and sisters the Church needs your contributions to the general missionary fund This fund makes possible the service of thousands of missionaries Those who can should feel free to contribute generously The Lord provides an equal opportunity for every member everywhere in the world to receive the blessings that come from paying tithes and offerings Every member can give his time and talents freely to the building up of the kingdom of God upon the earth No member of the Church should miss this opportunity to exercise his faith and feel the spirit that comes from humble sacrifice Seeing the great good that the Saints in South America do with their meager means helps me realize how much more many of us in other parts of the world could do We should never forget the Savior s teaching Unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required Luke 12 48 He has blessed us abundantly I think of the teaching words of one of our hymns Because I have been given much I too must give Because of thy great bounty Lord each day I liveI shall divide my gifts from theeWith ev ry brother that I seeWho has the need of help from meI pray that as we leave this conference each one of us will take from the messages of the Brethren those principles that will help us to become more self sufficient as Saints I testify that we have been taught the truth during this conference that God lives that Jesus Christ is his Son and that the gospel has been restored in these latter days All of which I do in his sacred name even the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters since last general conference I have felt in my own life the power of priesthood blessings and the power of the faith and prayers of Church members For many years I have given blessings to others I have fasted and prayed for their well being and have exercised my faith for their recovery Recently during a serious illness I was the recipient of such faith prayers and blessings I thank you brothers and sisters for the prayers that you have offered in my behalf One of my colleagues said to me that some good would come from this illness He suggested that it is good on occasion for everyone to face adversity especially if it causes introspection that enables us to openly and honestly assess our lives That is what I did The night before my surgery my doctors talked about the possibility of cancer When I was left alone my mind filled with thoughts of my family and of my ministry I found comfort in the ordinances of the gospel that bind me to my family if we are faithful I realized that I needed to rearrange some of my priorities to accomplish the things that matter most to me Sometimes we need a personal crisis to reinforce in our minds what we really value and cherish The scriptures are filled with examples of people facing crises before learning how to better serve God and others Perhaps if you too search your hearts and courageously assess the priorities in your life you may discover as I did that you need a better balance among your priorities All of us must come to an honest open self examination an awareness within as to who and what we want to be As most of you know coping with the complex and diverse challenges of everyday life which is not an easy task can upset the balance and harmony we seek Many good people who care a great deal are trying very hard to maintain balance but they sometimes feel overwhelmed and defeated A mother of four small children said There is no balance at all in my life I am completely consumed in trying to raise my children I hardly have time to think of anything else A young father who felt the pressure of being the family provider said My new business requires all of my time I realize that I am neglecting my family and church duties but if I can just get through one more year I will make enough money and then things will settle down A high school student said We hear so many contrasting views that it is hard to always know what is right and what is wrong How often have we heard this one No one knows better than I do how important exercise is but I just have no time in my day for exercising A single parent said I find it next to impossible to accomplish all that I need to do to manage my home and lead my family In fact sometimes I think the world expects too much of me Regardless of how hard I work I never will live up to everyone s expectations Another mother of four remarked My struggle is between self esteem confidence and feelings of self worth versus guilt depression and discouragement for not doing everything I am told we must do to attain the celestial kingdom Brothers and sisters we all face these kinds of struggles from time to time They are common human experiences Many people have heavy demands upon them stemming from parental family employment church and civic responsibilities Keeping everything in balance can be a real problem A periodic review of the covenants we have made with the Lord will help us with our priorities and with balance in our lives This review will help us see where we need to repent and change our lives to ensure that we are worthy of the promises that accompany our covenants and sacred ordinances Working out our own salvation requires good planning and a deliberate valiant effort I have a few suggestions that I hope will be valuable to those of you concerned with balancing life s demands These suggestions are very basic their concepts can easily be overlooked if you are not careful You will need a strong commitment and personal discipline to incorporate them into your life First think about your life and set your priorities Find some quiet time regularly to think deeply about where you are going and what you will need to do to get there Jesus our exemplar often withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed Luke 5 16 We need to do the same thing occasionally to rejuvenate ourselves spiritually as the Savior did Write down the tasks you would like to accomplish each day Keep foremost in mind the sacred covenants you have made with the Lord as you write down your daily schedules Second set short term goals that you can reach Set goals that are well balanced not too many nor too few and not too high nor too low Write down your attainable goals and work on them according to their importance Pray for divine guidance in your goal setting You recall that Alma said he would like to be an angel so he could speak with the trump of God to shake the earth and cry repentance unto every people Alma 29 1 He then said But behold I am a man and do sin in my wish for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me Why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called Alma 29 3 6 Third everyone faces financial challenges in life Through wise budgeting control your real needs and measure them carefully against your many wants in life Far too many individuals and families have incurred too much debt Be careful of the many attractive offers to borrow money It is much easier to borrow money than it is to pay it back There are no shortcuts to financial security There are no get rich quick schemes that work Perhaps none need the principle of balance in their lives more than those who are driven toward accumulating things in this world Do not trust your money to others without a thorough evaluation of any proposed investment Our people have lost far too much money by trusting their assets to others In my judgment we never will have balance in our lives unless our finances are securely under control The prophet Jacob said to his people Wherefore do not spend money for that which is of no worth nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy Hearken diligently unto me and remember the words which I have spoken and come unto the Holy One of Israel and feast upon that which perisheth not neither can be corrupted and let your soul delight in fatness 2 Ne 9 51 Brothers and sisters remember to always pay a full tithing Fourth stay close to your spouse children relatives and friends They will help you keep a balance in your life In a recent study by the Church adults in the United States were asked to identify a time when they were very happy and to describe the experience They were also asked to describe a time when they were very unhappy For most people one thing that had made them the most happy or the most sad was their personal relationships with others Much less important were their personal health employment money and other material things Build relationships with your family and friends through open and honest communication A good marriage and good family relationships can be maintained through gentle loving thoughtful communication Remember that often a glance a wink a nod or a touch will say more than words A sense of humor and good listening are also vital parts of good communication Fifth study the scriptures They offer one of the best sources we have to keep in touch with the Spirit of the Lord One of the ways I have gained my sure knowledge that Jesus is the Christ is through my study of the scriptures President Ezra Taft Benson has called upon members of the Church to make the study of the Book of Mormon a daily habit and a lifetime pursuit The Apostle Paul s advice to Timothy is good counsel for each of us He wrote From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness 2 Tim 3 15 16 Sixth many people including me have difficulty finding the time for sufficient rest exercise and relaxation We must schedule time on our daily calendars for these activities if we are to enjoy a healthy and balanced life Good physical appearance enhances our dignity and self respect Seventh the prophets have taught repeatedly that families should teach one another the gospel preferably in a weekly family home evening This family practice if we are not very careful can slowly drift away from us We must not lose this special opportunity to teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom D C 88 77 which will lead families to eternal life Satan is always working to destroy our testimonies but he will not have the power to tempt or disturb us beyond our strength to resist when we are studying the gospel and living its commandments My last suggestion is to pray often as individuals and as families Parents need to exercise the discipline required to lead out and motivate children to join together for regular family prayers Our youth can know the right decisions to make each day through constant sincere prayer The prophet Alma summarized the importance of prayer in these words But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord and call on his holy name and watch and pray continually that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear and thus be led by the Holy Spirit becoming humble meek submissive patient full of love and all long suffering Alma 13 28 When I am in tune spiritually I find that I can balance everything in my life much more easily I realize brothers and sisters that other suggestions could be added to these However I believe that when we focus on a few basic objectives we are more likely to be able to manage the many demands that life makes on us Remember too much of anything in life can throw us off balance At the same time too little of the important things can do the same thing King Benjamin counseled that all these things are done in wisdom and order Mosiah 4 27 Often the lack of clear direction and goals can waste away our time and energy and contribute to imbalance in our lives A life that gets out of balance is much like a car tire that is out of balance It will make the operation of the car rough and unsafe Tires in perfect balance can give a smooth and comfortable ride So it is with life The ride through mortality can be smoother for us when we strive to stay in balance Our main goal should be to seek immortality and eternal life Moses 1 39 With this as our goal why not eliminate from our lives the things that clamor for and consume our thoughts feelings and energies without contributing to our reaching that goal Just a word to Church leaders Be very careful that what you ask from members will help them attain eternal life For Church members to be able to balance their lives Church leaders must be sure they do not require so much from members that they have no time to accomplish their personal and family goals Not long ago one of my children said Dad sometimes I wonder if I will ever make it The answer I gave to her is the same as I would give to you if you have had similar feelings Just do the very best you can each day Do the basic things and before you realize it your life will be full of spiritual understanding that will confirm to you that your Heavenly Father loves you When a person knows this then life will be full of purpose and meaning making balance easier to maintain Live every day with joy in your heart brothers and sisters I humbly testify that life can be wonderful in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Prophet Joseph Smith was often asked to inquire of the Lord to learn what people should do In the case of John Whitmer the Lord said And now behold I say unto you that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people that you may bring souls unto me that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father D C 15 6 Jesus repeatedly called upon his disciples to preach the gospel to every living soul Those who would believe were to be baptized in his name and enter into his church After the Savior s forty day fast and the temptation by Satan Jesus began to preach and to say Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers And he saith unto them Follow me and I will make you fishers of men And they straightway left their nets and followed him And Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom Matt 4 17 20 23 With loving patience Jesus taught his disciples and especially his twelve Apostles to preach the kingdom of God Luke 9 2 After the three years of his ministry crowned by the Atonement which included his glorious resurrection Jesus gathered his eleven disciples in Galilee And Jesus came and spake unto them saying All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world Matt 28 18 20 These instructions were clear When Peter the chief Apostle finally understood them he became a powerful leader For example on the day of Pentecost he stood with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them Ye men of Judea This Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ Now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles Men and brethren what shall we do Then Peter said unto them Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls Acts 2 14 32 36 38 41 When Jesus visited this continent Nephi went forth and bowed himself before the Lord And the Lord commanded him that he should arise And he arose and stood before him And the Lord said unto him I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven And again the Lord called others and said unto them likewise and he gave unto them power to baptize 3 Ne 11 20 22 To every people through all ages his message remains the same Preach the kingdom of God Luke 9 2 The First Presidency has said that one of the threefold missions of the Church is to proclaim the gospel If we accept this mission we should be willing to center our efforts on bringing souls unto the Lord on condition of repentance Two years ago I spoke on this subject and I continue to feel an urgent need that we must constantly remind and help each other in our responsibilities to share the message of the Restoration with others We often hear members say I know I should share the gospel but I don t know how to do it Perhaps the following success stories that have come to me may help you These experiences resulted when members of the Church exercised their faith and followed some simple steps such as setting a date to have someone prepared to be taught by the missionaries From England In my calling as branch president I decided one day to invite our whole community to join us in fasting and giving a fast offering for the people of Ethiopia I had 4 000 leaflets produced which we distributed to homes in our area One of the leaflets was delivered to a nonmember and he and his wife felt impressed to take part It was the name of the Church on the leaflet which first impressed them The husband came to the chapel with the fast offering as invited and I met him there I gave him a tour of our small building shared my testimony with him and invited him to come to church Sunday He came and I introduced him to our missionaries who arranged to call on the home I was privileged to join with the missionaries on several joint teaching visits and I developed a close relationship with the family On the evening of March 2 the night before the date I had set I baptized the wife Her husband will follow soon and their daughter We have now met other families through this one who are being taught As for my wife and me we have set another date From Oregon I set a date of just under two months and proceeded to ask for divine guidance in all of my daily prayers and to fast for strength not to lose sight of my goal My date came and went with a few pangs of guilt However I received a message one week later that an old friend of mine that I had gone to school with wanted me to call I gave him a call and invited him over that night My friend went with me to pick up some pizza As we drove into town I told him that I was a member of the LDS church He was interested so I related some of the many blessings I had received I then asked him to attend church with me that next Sunday which he did From the beginning he accepted it all We invited him to be baptized He said he didn t want to be rushed into anything At this time I was impressed to read to him from the Book of Mormon using the words that Alma used at the waters of Mormon As I read those verses from Mosiah 18 to him I paused at each question that Alma asked and asked him if he were willing to do it also He said yes to all of it Then I read him verse 10 and asked him What have you against being baptized He looked at me and said You re right I have nothing to wait for So the date was set and I baptized and confirmed him a member of the Church From Florida As I knelt in prayer I expressed a sincere desire to share the gospel with someone and asked my Heavenly Father to please send someone to me The very next morning there was a knock on my door and it was a neighbor wanting to borrow a pan Although she had lived by us for some time we had not had much contact Two days later both she and her husband came over to visit with us During our conversation she mentioned that they had been looking for a church I told her how my husband and I were once in that very same position and how our church filled that very special need we had We invited them to church that Sunday and they eagerly accepted Afterward we asked them if they would be interested in learning more by having the missionary lessons in our home They told us that indeed they would be interested On Christmas Day my husband baptized and confirmed them members of the Church They have grown so strong and they set a shining example to all They are looking forward to the day when they and their new baby girl can be sealed in the temple for time and eternity Then from far off Buenos Aires In our family prayers we began to include the names of nonmembers who had not yet joined the Church My children prayed for them Our prayers were different We were changing our attitude toward missionary work from waiting for opportunities to share the gospel to asking the Lord to prepare specific people by name to receive the lessons We have seen one person come into the Church who is now fully active Three other families chosen with the Lord s help have received the third discussion All have been to church at least twice All have been in our home for friendshipping and encouragement They are receiving the opportunity to accept or reject the gospel message My brothers and sisters from the experiences of these people and many more like them we learn that we can give the saving ordinances of the gospel to others when we allow the Lord to help us with someone we know and love Sharing our feelings about God and religion should be easy since most Latter day Saints are loving sharing and trusting people With a relationship of trust established and with help from the Lord we generally can feel comfortable moving beyond the realm of friendship and can invite our friends to learn more about the Church There are many ways to share the gospel I know that the following four simple steps will help you in your effort to find and to share the gospel with others because many members have used them and have had successful missionary experiences Step one Prayerfully set a date by which you will have someone prepared to hear the gospel We must start somewhere and this simple act of faith on our part will serve to motivate us Do not worry if you do not have someone already in mind Let the Lord help you Step two Prayerfully choose a friend or someone you already know someone with whom you may have already discussed the gospel or given a Book of Mormon or other Church literature or taken to church Step three Share your date and your plans with your bishopric ward mission leader and the full time missionaries They will help you The most important step is step four With the help of the Spirit invite your nonmember friend to hear the missionary discussions This step extending an invitation to hear the gospel requires the most faith faith to do as you are prompted by the Holy Ghost In talking of faith and saving souls you should understand that when the Spirit is present people are not offended when you share your feelings about the gospel By prayerfully following these steps you are putting a plan into effect that translates your faith into action There are many good ways that you can use to prepare someone to feel the Spirit A few examples are bear your testimony pray together read the scriptures give a Book of Mormon share a spiritual experience take your friend to church present a gospel film or tape and discuss the gospel Please note that all of these same steps and principles will also work when we use them to invite the inactive member of the Church to come back into full activity In the fiftieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants we are assured that he that receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth Wherefore he that preacheth and he that receiveth understand one another and both are edified and rejoice together D C 50 21 22 The key to success in bringing souls unto Christ is to act at a time when you feel the Spirit and you sense that your friend does also Remember brothers and sisters through our faith our trust in the Lord and our good works we can bring many souls unto the Lord We can enjoy the blessings of living with them in the kingdom of our Father Shortly after the death of Sister LeGrand Richards I was assigned to be Elder Richards junior companion to assist him in creating the Atlanta Georgia Stake As we were flying toward his beloved Southern States Mission he said to me Brother Ballard I am not afraid to die the only thing I worry about is will I be able to find Mommy over there I was impressed to say to Elder Richards that in his case that could be a real problem Immediately I had his full attention He looked me directly in the eye and said What do you mean by that With my emotions near the surface I answered this great missionary Elder Richards when you die so many people there will be anxious to greet you because you introduced the gospel to them that you might have difficulty finding Mommy in the crowd His response was Oh you don t mean that We all might ask ourselves the question Who will be there to greet us Oh that I could have the power to touch your hearts that you would have the faith to take the simple steps that will bring the light of the gospel to many more of our Father s children The more I am involved in this work the more I realize that Satan would have you and me believe that we cannot succeed in sharing the gospel He lies to us In fact he is the father of all lies Do not listen to him Listen to the prompting of the Holy Ghost and then act in faith in sharing the gospel I testify to you my brothers and sisters that I know the Lord lives I know that when we are willing to seek his help and guidance when we trust in him completely he will bless us to understand what to do and how to proceed in the wonderful work of sharing this glorious message with others We do appreciate all you have done in the past The leaders of the Church have great faith that united together the members and the missionaries of this Church can do much more in the future to build the kingdom of God May the Lord bless us all with increased faith to move his work forward I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters my wife Barbara our family and I express to you our deep appreciation for your messages of love and support since my call last October to the Council of the Twelve Apostles All of my life I have held the Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in great esteem From the early days of my childhood the term Apostle has been one that my father and mother used with deep reverence Since my ordination to this special calling I have had many hours to ponder the sacred responsibility that now rests upon my shoulders The calling of an Apostle is to be a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world particularly of his divinity and of his bodily resurrection from the dead The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is a Traveling Presiding High Council to officiate in the name of the Lord under the direction of the Presidency of the Church agreeable to the institution of heaven to build up the church and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations first unto the Gentiles and secondly unto the Jews D C 107 33 The Lord said to Thomas B Marsh the President of the Council of the Twelve Now I say unto you and what I say unto you I say unto all the Twelve Arise and gird up your loins take up your cross follow me and feed my sheep And again I say unto you that whosoever ye shall send in my name by the voice of your brethren the Twelve duly recommended and authorized by you shall have power to open the door of my kingdom unto any nation whithersoever ye shall send them D C 112 14 21 Twelve days ago I returned from South America where I had visited the people of Uruguay Argentina and Colombia Last December I visited Peru and Brazil Reflecting upon these two recent assignments I observed the dramatic growth of the Church among these people Elder Parley P Pratt visited South America in 1851 The work was attempted again in 1925 On Christmas Day of 1925 in the park of Tres de Febrero in Buenos Aires Argentina my grandfather Elder Melvin J Ballard dedicated South America for the preaching of the gospel I quote from the dedicatory prayer Bless the presidents governors and the leading officials of these South American countries that they may kindly receive us and give us permission to open the doors of salvation to the people of these lands And now oh Father by authority of the blessing and appointment by the President of the Church and by the authority of the holy apostleship which I have I turn the key unlock and open the door for the preaching of the Gospel in all these South American nations and do rebuke and command to be stayed every power that would oppose the preaching of the Gospel in these lands and we do bless and dedicate these nations of this land for the preaching of thy Gospel And we do all this that salvation may come to all men and that thy name may be honored and glorified in this part of the land of Zion Melvin J Ballard Crusader for Righteousness Salt Lake City Bookcraft 1966 p 81 italics added The words by the authority of the holy apostleship have special meaning to me now as my ministry bears that same authority to accomplish the purposes of our Heavenly Father The original recorded history of the three General Authority missionaries who visited Buenos Aires in 1925 was found there a few days before my arrival this last March 14 I read with great interest of the extreme difficulties that they encountered The trip from Salt Lake City to Buenos Aires for Elders Melvin J Ballard Rey L Pratt and Rulon S Wells was by land and sea taking thirty four days In comparison my recent trip covering the same distance took twenty one hours There were only four members of the Church in South America in 1925 they greeted the missionaries upon their arrival To conserve resources the missionaries rented one hotel room to house all three of them They moved several times until they finally located a low cost apartment in which the three of them could live Efforts to advertise the first public meetings in the Buenos Aires newspapers were fruitless The newspapers refused to print an ad Elder Pratt prepared a handbill in Spanish Elder Ballard who spoke only English distributed these handbills each day Elder Pratt spent most of his time translating doctrine and hymns into Spanish Elder Wells who spoke German became ill and returned to Church headquarters shortly after his arrival in Argentina My brothers and sisters it is difficult to express my feelings as I read of the early beginnings of missionary work in South America I am deeply touched to realize that for nearly eight months my grandfather walked the streets of Buenos Aires giving out two hundred to five hundred handbills every day but Sunday inviting the people to learn the message of the Restoration The work among the native Argentines was very difficult Only one was baptized during the first eight months On 4 July 1926 Grandfather said The work of the Lord will grow slowly for a time here just as an oak grows slowly from an acorn It will not shoot up in a day as does the sunflower that grows quickly and then dies But thousands will join the Church here It will be divided into more than one mission and will be one of the strongest in the Church The work here is the smallest that it will ever be The day will come when the Lamanites in this land will be given a chance The South American Mission will be a power in the Church Vernon Sharp diary in Melvin J Ballard p 84 Sixty years later the Church in South America has 30 missions with 5 140 full time missionaries of which approximately 60 percent are natives of South America One hundred eighty six stakes cover the land with 2 148 wards and branches dotting the countryside Approximately 776 000 members of the Church are an evidence of the fulfillment of the dedicatory prayer At the regional conference last month in Montevideo President and Sister J Thomas Fyans and I met with 3 350 Saints President and Sister Helio R Camargo and I met with more than 3 100 Saints in Bogota Colombia the following Sunday The work is prospering in this part of the Lord s vineyard The effective work of the General Authorities of the past and of those of today is evidenced in the faithful lives of the Saints Thousands of missionaries have served with distinction Dedicated men and women are leading the Church in their own countries in a magnificent way It is a joy to see second and third generation members living worthy to be leaders in South America My brothers and sisters as I visited with the Saints in South America the words of Nephi came to mind He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world for he loveth the world even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him Wherefore he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation 2 Ne 26 24 The gospel of Jesus Christ radiates in the faces of the Saints They express faith and commitment and love for the Lord They are seeking to be worthy of the full blessings of the gospel Several Aaronic Priesthood boys dressed in their Scout uniforms greeted me in Bogota Without hesitation they all told me they will serve as missionaries as soon as they are old enough With such a spirit the future of the Church in South America will be in good hands I visited the temple in Buenos Aires Feelings of gratitude welled up within me to know that within the four dedicated temples of South America the fulness of the gospel is blessing the members of the Church An example of the marvelous commitment of the Saints of South America was demonstrated by the dear sisters hand crocheting sixty four altar cloths for the Buenos Aires Temple when only seven were requested My dear brothers and sisters as a member of the Council of the Twelve I now know as never before that we live in a big world Nearly five billion of our Heavenly Father s children live on it The responsibility of taking the gospel to them rests upon our shoulders I am impressed as I now start to see the larger picture that the stake presidents must take more of the responsibility for preparing their people to receive all the blessings of the gospel Bishops and branch presidents must do likewise Our work is not complete until our Father s children enter the temple to receive all of the necessary ordinances to prepare them for celestial living in the presence of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ Teaching and preparing the members of the Church to be worthy of the temple blessings rests upon the shoulders of the priesthood There is no substitute in my opinion for inspired local leaders I was most impressed with the conversion stories told by the stake presidencies in Bogota One stake president who has served for more than eight years reported that he was called after only two and one half years of membership in the Church The Lord does bless his leaders when they put their trust in him The Church is organized properly We need to be sure that every man learns his duty and acts in the office in which he is appointed in all diligence see D C 107 99 It seems clear to me as this great work continues to roll forth that the leaders of the Church at every level and particularly at the stake and ward levels need to understand God s plan for his children and then teach these principles to their people The building up of the Church will surely be enhanced if all Church leaders will teach the pure simple doctrinal truths that bring the children of God to a spiritual understanding The Lord said And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you D C 88 77 78 In my judgment the greatest motivator that we have in the Church is to have Church members understand the plan of salvation Stake presidents and bishops you are the key to having your members come to this understanding Every leader should strive to motivate the people to good works by teaching the doctrines of the kingdom The scriptures are our text for in them ye think ye have eternal life John 5 39 From them we glean the truths that will open to us a clear understanding of man s eternal possibilities I very humbly commit to you my dear brothers and sisters that in my calling as a member of the Council of the Twelve I will do everything within my power to teach the plan of our Father in Heaven for the redemption and exaltation of his children I will strive to clarify the truths that can provide eternal life for the sons and daughters of God I pledge to the First Presidency and to you that I will so live that if I ever should be sent to unlock the way for the restored gospel to enter a nation of the earth I will be prepared the way the first missionaries were when they dedicated and blessed the lands of South America We are living in a most exciting time What a joy it is to know that the power of the holy priesthood is operating throughout the Church to bless the lives of the Saints It is wonderful to know that the priesthood vested in the latter day Apostles has in this dispensation opened many nations to the preaching of the gospel Surely in the future we will see other nations opened in the same remarkable way I testify to you that Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten Son of our Eternal Heavenly Father He is our Savior our Redeemer our Friend and Brother I love him with all my heart and count it the greatest privilege that could ever come to a man to be a special witness to his name throughout the world May the Lord bless us my brothers and sisters in doing his work is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters I am deeply humbled at the confidence of the Lord and my Brethren and pledge to you that I will do the very best I know how The past nine and a half years as I have been sent on errands for the Lord throughout the earth have caused me to know that this Church is filled with righteous good dedicated men Each of us obediently learns that we will come forth as we are called to try to do the very best we can in our callings whether it be home teacher whether it be stake president or whether it be General Authority I understand the source of the call I have learned during the past nine and a half years that this is our Heavenly Father s church The errands that I have been sent on to act in the name of the Lord enable me to witness to you today that I know as I know that I stand before you that Jesus is the Christ that he lives He is very close to this work and very close to all of us who are asked to perform the work throughout the earth in his name I would like also to bear witness that in my particular case the veil between here and the hereafter is rather thin I acknowledge that it has been a great blessing in my life to be born of goodly parents grandparents and great grandparents who have given everything they have been asked to give to the building of the kingdom of God upon the earth Now my brothers and sisters I would ask for an interest in your faith and prayers I express my affection to my wife and my children who sustain me in whatever the Lord might ask me to do I am grateful for this abundant blessing and pray humbly that I might serve you the membership of this Church in a way that would be pleasing and acceptable unto our Heavenly Father and ask this prayer humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Just fifteen days ago by assignment I left Addis Ababa Ethiopia which is approximately ten thousand miles from here The world is very small in some ways Had I been able to fly directly from Addis Ababa to Salt Lake City it would have taken approximately nineteen hours In many other ways however the world is very large Billions of our Heavenly Father s children live upon the earth in all kinds of circumstances the plight of those who are living in the drought stricken areas of Africa is disastrous Human suffering there is almost beyond description I do not know all the reasons for the suffering However this most recent experience in my life has had a profound effect on me I will never be the same I can testify to you my brethren that I know as I have never known before that to enjoy the privilege of holding the holy priesthood is a most treasured blessing If every one of you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood could have been on the mission to Ethiopia with Bishop Glenn Pace and me your hearts surely would have been filled with the desire to honor your priesthood I do not believe even one of us in this vast priesthood gathering should take for granted the great blessings that we enjoy as bearers of the holy priesthood When we arrived in Ethiopia we found one member of the Church Brother Harry Hadlock from Seattle Washington He was overjoyed to meet two brethren of the priesthood On Sunday morning the three of us held a testimony meeting and then with our priesthood blessed and passed the sacrament The Spirit of the Lord was present Because we had a deep yearning to help our Father s children who were suffering we offered a special prayer that rain might come to that drought stricken area We felt a deep sense of the importance of our mission I knew that if we called upon the Lord to bless the land the elements would be tempered We prayed brethren for rain During the balance of the time we were in Ethiopia it rained every day wherever we traveled We were grateful to our Heavenly Father because the rain was a special witness to us that he was aware that his sons bearing his holy priesthood were about his business in that part of the world But there was more we could do for them much more We have a spiritual gift the living waters to share See John 4 10 Could we but give them this they would not thirst thereafter My brethren tonight I feel a deep urgency to touch the heart of every boy in the Church that each one might have a desire to live worthy to hold the Melchizedek Priesthood and serve a mission You young men must live worthy to become elders so you can carry the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation kindred tongue and people as the Lord has commanded us to do See Mosiah 15 28 The light of the gospel of Jesus Christ is needed desperately in the far reaches of the earth You young men who are here tonight need to prepare now for your future service I would ask which one of you knows what the Lord has in mind for you to do in the future May I ask also which of you may someday sit here in the Tabernacle in these red chairs on the rostrum As unlikely as it may seem to you young men tonight all of the General Authorities were boys once much like you Even I was your age once No young man should aspire to a calling but as surely as you are sitting in this priesthood meeting tonight many of you will preside over wards stakes missions quorums and of course your own families Priesthood training my brethren starts when a young man is ordained a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood You Aaronic Priesthood bearers need to understand that you are in training Nephi had a good training plan I recommend it to all of the boys here tonight And it came to pass that I Nephi being exceedingly young he was in his teens nevertheless being large in stature and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God wherefore I did cry unto the Lord and behold he did visit me and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father wherefore I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers 1 Ne 2 16 italics added The key my brethren was Nephi s desire to know of the mysteries of God You young men fill your hearts with this desire Of all the training I have received in my Church assignments none has been more important to me than the training I received as a nineteen year old elder serving a full time mission in the British Isles As I look back now I can see that no training in my life was more important for what I am now doing in the Church than the training I received as a full time missionary I am convinced boys that the Lord has no better place to get acquainted with you than when you serve him in the mission field When you are serving your mission he will send you on errands to act in his name He will give you experience with the power of the Holy Ghost He will authorize you to teach to convert and then to perform the sacred ordinances of salvation in his name He will come to know you He will come to know that he can trust you and can rely on you He will help you learn the lessons that will qualify you for the great work that you must perform as you do your part in carrying the message of the Restoration to everyone in the world On the recent errand to Ethiopia the Spirit prompted Brother Pace and me We knew what to do We knew what to say We knew where to go In many ways boys I relived some of my missionary experiences of thirty four years ago For example we needed a permit from the government to travel to Makale to visit the food stations and the distribution centers where tens of thousands of homeless refugees were gathered When the permit was delayed desiring to fill our mission we knelt in prayer and asked the Lord for help The next morning the permits were issued Then we needed to get from Addis Ababa to Makale We again prayed for help and then found passage with a British Royal Air Force mercy flight in a C 130 Hercules transport plane From Makale we had no way to travel to Asmara The Lord knew of our need Late in the afternoon we hitched a ride with a Swedish Air Force mercy flight Hitchhiking is not a good idea and especially not by air but being on the Lord s errand it was all right I have deep affection for the goodness of people many of whom I met in far off Ethiopia who are not members of the Church but who are giving unselfish Christian service Brethren I was so grateful that the Church made a significant contribution to help meet a desperate need I believe if we had more missionaries in the world rendering meaningful Christian service and helping people come to the knowledge of the glorious message of the Restoration we would find favor with the Lord I say to you young men tonight get ready every one of you get ready This world needs your service Repent if you need to Study from the standard works every day Say your prayers morning and night Develop in your heart a desire to know the mysteries of God To lead the Church tomorrow you must prepare today Train hard boys and I promise you that you will live to be grateful that you made the effort to prepare Now you young men may I speak a few words to your bishops and stake presidents You can listen if you d like to The past four days we have enjoyed historic meetings with the mission presidents and their wives from every mission in the Church along with all of the Regional Representatives and the stake presidents We have received instruction from the First Presidency the Council of the Twelve and others We were instructed to call every worthy boy to serve a mission I encourage each of you bishops in the Church to review carefully the roster of boys who are old enough to serve missions so you can extend a call to every one Don t miss one I would like to share with you a personal experience When I served as bishop many years ago a fine young man in our ward had fallen in love before being called to serve his mission He made it known that he was going to get married and would not be available for missionary service I worried how I was going to approach this young man because I felt an urgency as his bishop to see that he served our Father in Heaven as a missionary When I invited Doug into my office I approached him in a different way than I had ever approached a prospective missionary I was prompted to say Doug the Lord wants you to serve a mission Doug said he was not going to serve a mission because he was going to be married I asked him to get together with his sweetheart and his parents and to fast and to pray I asked him to come back within a week and tell me what he was going to do about the fact that he had been called to serve the Lord One week later with a great deal of emotion Doug said to me Bishop we did what you asked us to do I cannot ignore a call from the Lord I desire to serve How do I proceed Doug served his mission In fact he served as a counselor to his mission president Upon returning he married his sweetheart She waited for him that is not always the case and it may not always be best that they do but in Doug s case it worked out He has since served as a bishop and presently serves as the first counselor in his stake presidency His mission was one of the most important training periods of his life May we ask all priesthood leaders especially you fathers to help prepare your sons Prepare them both spiritually and temporally to look and to act as servants of the Lord Now you fine young men of the Aaronic Priesthood remember the Aaronic Priesthood is a preparatory priesthood You are in training Train hard Get ready The Lord needs you The world needs you The Church needs you A wonderful chorus of missionaries sang to us yesterday these words Called to serve him heav nly King of glory Chosen e er to witness for his name Onward ever onward as we glory in his name May God bless all of you young men to desire to serve him is my humble prayer In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I pray that my message might be received in the spirit of the address of Elder Oaks Recently the First Presidency and the Twelve assigned me to work with the Missionary Department Missionary work is a great challenge especially when we realize that approximately 4 7 billion people live on the earth today The earth s present population gain is 150 new persons per minute 9 100 per hour 218 100 per day and 79 6 million per year If you are 50 years old the world s population has more than doubled in your lifetime Global Population Growing by More Than 200 000 a Day U S News and World Report 23 July 1984 p 52 At the present time more people are born in one day than are baptized into the Church in one year The magnitude of our missionary task can appear to be overwhelming Yet the assignment to the members of the Church is very clear We are to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to every human soul Jesus taught Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world Matt 28 19 20 With faith we shall do as the Lord directed for the Prophet Joseph Smith declared The truth of God will go forth boldly nobly and independent till it has penetrated every continent visited every clime swept every country and sounded in every ear till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done History of the Church 4 540 An indication of the faith we need to meet this challenge was expressed by Elder Boyd K Packer who said Since baptism is essential there must be an urgent concern to carry the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation kindred tongue and people We accept the responsibility to preach the gospel to every person on earth And if the question is asked You mean you are out to convert the entire world the answer is Yes We will try to reach every living soul Some who measure that challenge quickly say Why that s impossible It cannot be done To that we simply say Perhaps but we shall do it anyway Ensign Nov 1975 p 97 Part of the answer may lie in our ability to more fully understand and accelerate the use of modern communication technology to teach the gospel to all the world We must use to their greatest potential the newspapers magazines television radio and satellites But even with all of the technology working for us there is no power in the Church to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ that can equal what you and I as individuals can do I am aware that most members of the Church understand that they should take an active part in proclaiming the gospel Some have been quite successful but others have not yet tried I believe that far too many Church members do not understand the underlying doctrine that governs our Heavenly Father s work Joseph Smith taught Baptism is a sign to God to angels and to heaven that we do the will of God and there is no other way beneath the heavens whereby God hath ordained for man to come to Him to be saved and enter into the kingdom of God except faith in Jesus Christ repentance and baptism for the remission of sins then you have the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost History of the Church 4 555 When they are baptized men and women receive a remission of their sins and become numbered among the Saints to receive the blessings and happiness that membership in the Church can give A natural consequence of conversion is the continued remission of sin by living the gospel which includes sharing the gospel with others President Spencer W Kimball declared The Lord has told us that our sins will be forgiven more readily as we bring souls unto Christ and remain steadfast in bearing testimony to the world and surely every one of us is looking for additional help in being forgiven of our sins Ensign Oct 1977 p 5 In the Doctrine and Covenants we read For I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment that you remain steadfast in your minds in solemnity and the spirit of prayer in bearing testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you D C 84 61 italics added And also in the Doctrine and Covenants Nevertheless ye are blessed for the testimony which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon and they rejoice over you and your sins are forgiven you D C 62 3 italics added A former prophet of God President George Albert Smith said My understanding is that the most important mission that I have in this life is first to keep the commandments of God as they have been taught to me and next to teach them to my Father s children who do not understand them in Conference Report Oct 1916 p 50 The doctrine seems quite clear to me the remission of sins is an ongoing process As each one of us strives to become clean pure and even sanctified I see no better way for us to do this than to help others of our Heavenly Father s children find the truth When we partake of the sacrament we covenant that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and that we will always remember Him and keep His commandments See D C 20 77 Is there any better way that you and I can demonstrate to the Lord our love for Him than to share His gospel We need not be sent to far flung cities or set our feet on distant lands to be missionaries Our next door neighbors friends acquaintances family members relatives and the stranger down the street are all part of the world with whom we should be sharing the gospel message No member of the Church needs to wait for the ward stake mission or any Church organization to lead them in doing this work Each one of us should be actively involved in sharing the gospel because we love the Lord with all of our hearts and because we desire to serve Him The scriptures teach Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God For behold the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh wherefore he suffered the pain of all men that all men might repent and come unto him And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth Wherefore you are called to cry repentance unto this people And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people and bring save it be one soul unto me how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father D C 18 10 11 13 15 Just think of it brothers and sisters Jesus Christ suffered the pain of all men that you and I might have the promise of eternal life Surely He can expect us to do His work that He has entrusted to us Our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son have not left us alone in this great work They have promised to guide us if we will but ask them for help May I suggest a simple way in which each one of us can exercise our faith and start our personal missionary service Write down a date in the near future on which you will have someone ready to be taught the gospel Do not worry that you do not have someone already in mind Let the Lord help you as you pray diligently for guidance Fast and pray seeking guidance and direction from our Heavenly Father Many if not all of you will have special spiritual experiences as the Lord inspires you I know from my own personal and family missionary experience that the Lord will enlighten your mind He will sharpen your vision of this work by bringing names of nonmembers to your mind that you have never before regarded as potential members of the Church As you continue you will be blessed to know what you should say and how you should approach each person Brothers and sisters you will notice that I did not suggest that you write down a name but rather that you write down a specific date The key to our success will be to ask for divine guidance that we might be directed to those who will accept the gospel Because living the gospel is essential to the remission of sins and because giving missionary service is essential to living the gospel I believe each one of us must set a definite date at least once each year to have an individual or a family ready to be taught the gospel We should expect to have wonderful success We in the Missionary Department would like to hear of your success as you follow this counsel No joy equals that of bringing the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ into the life of one of Heavenly Father s children Missionary experiences can bring to every member of the Church the calm reassurance that his sins are in very deed being forgiven Our Heavenly Father will love us for proclaiming the gospel of His Son Jesus Christ to all of His children on the earth Please do not wait for anyone but the Lord to help you He will help you Our individual efforts can produce a great increase in building the kingdom of God If just 30 percent of the active adult members of the Church would follow this simple procedure at least once each year we would add 200 000 additional converts to those we are already baptizing Compounded this would mean in ten years an increase of at least 5 4 million more converts than we would have had at our present level of member effort If 100 percent of the active adults would participate we would soon start to see that every living soul can receive the message May God bless all of us that we will have the courage to commit ourselves to a specific date for having someone ready to hear the gospel message Then may we proceed to call upon the Lord to guide our efforts so that thousands of our Heavenly Father s children will receive the gospel of Jesus Christ May we all look upon this not as a duty but rather as a great privilege This I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
For the past several years I have served as Executive Director of the Church Curriculum Department When I became fully aware of the immense effort required to prepare a single course of study I was overwhelmed I now have much greater appreciation for the approved teaching materials of the Church Let me give you an example The present Gospel Doctrine Teacher s Supplement which was prepared to help teachers teach the New Testament was written by a committee of faithful and knowledgeable Church service writers who were called and set apart for that service by one of the General Authorities Their work commenced in the spring of 1980 following General Authority approval of the outline Writing committee members spent thousands of hours researching writing and attending biweekly committee meetings where the entire committee critiqued each lesson carefully and suggested improvements The work of the writing committee then was reviewed by General Authority Managing Directors of the Priesthood and Curriculum departments the General Presidency and the General Board of the Sunday School Church Editing and Church Correlation Review This manual received careful scrutiny at many levels before it was approved for use in Sunday School this year All teaching materials for the Church follow this same basic procedure in their preparation Teachers would be well advised to study carefully the scriptures and their manuals before reaching out for supplemental materials Far too many teachers seem to stray from the approved curriculum materials without fully reviewing them If teachers feel a need to use some good supplemental resources beyond the scriptures and manuals in presenting a lesson they should first consider the use of the Church magazines Teachers can stay on safe ground when they use the standard works the approved manuals and the writings of the General Authorities Elder Hyrum M Smith of the Council of the Twelve said There is more to be learned in five minutes reading in the Holy Scriptures more that is worthy of retention in the memory more that will be helpful if we remember and obey them than we can find in reading all of the six best sellers in every month in the year In Conference Report Oct 1917 p 38 I believe there is no greater call in the Church than to be an effective teacher Effective teaching by the Spirit can stir the souls of men with a desire to live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ more completely In each teaching setting whether it is a family home evening a class a sacrament meeting or a general or stake conference the teacher should strive to create a heartfelt desire in his students to live worthy of eternal life with our Heavenly Father Regarding the need of effective teaching in the Church President Kimball gave this counsel Please take a particular interest in strengthening and improving the quality of teaching in the Church I fear at times that all too often many of our members come to church sit through a class or meeting and then return home having been largely uninformed We all need to be touched and nurtured by the Spirit and effective teaching is one of the most important ways this can happen Ensign May 1981 p 45 The Apostle Paul placed the priority of teachers in the Church next only to the Apostles and the prophets when he said And God hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers 1 Cor 12 28 President Brigham Young used the following story to illustrate the potential influence of teachers A traveller in the Eastern country overtook an old gentleman walking towards a town and asked him Who is the great man of that little town Who is your leading man Who is the governor and controlling spirit of that little place The old gentleman replied I am the king of that little town Really says the traveller are you the leading man Yes sir I am king in that place and reign as king How do you make this to appear Are you in affluent circumstances No I am poor but in that little village there are so many children All those children go to my school I rule the children and they rule their parents and that makes me king Journal of Discourses 9 39 President David O McKay said No greater responsibility can rest upon any man than to be a teacher of God s children In Conference Report Oct 1916 p 57 May we ask you priesthood leaders who call your members to become teachers to be prayerful and concerned when selecting those who will teach in your stakes wards or quorums Be sure to provide ongoing in service teacher training Visit the classrooms on occasion and express genuine interest in the great cause of teaching Please do not leave this most important work unattended The Lord set the example when he sent Paul to the home of Ananias The Lord did not leave him to flounder in his newly found faith but rather as recorded in the ninth chapter of Acts Paul received specific training to become a mighty gospel teacher and Apostle Should not every teaching setting within the Church be a forum of faith where the teacher strengthens spirituality and fosters faith in the lives of those being taught President J Reuben Clark s instructions to a group of professional teachers apply to all teachers in the Church He said Your essential and all but sole duty is to teach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ You are to teach this Gospel using as your sources and authorities the Standard Works of the Church and the words of those whom God has called to lead His people in these last days You are not to intrude into your work your own peculiar philosophy no matter what its source or how pleasing or rational it seems to you to be The Charted Course of the Church in Education an address delivered at the Brigham Young University Summer School in Aspen Grove Utah 8 Aug 1938 p 9 Jesus chided the Sadducees for their incorrect teachings He said Ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God Matt 22 29 The Lord stressed the need for prayerful preparation by teachers as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach D C 42 14 One of the great teachers in my life President N Eldon Tanner said In my opinion no greater call can come to anyone than to be a teacher in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints We are all teachers in one way or another whether we have been called and set apart as such or not Teaching Children of God Ensign Oct 1980 p 2 Surely no teachers in the Church are more important than fathers and mothers No classroom is more important than the home Parents have been commanded to teach their children the gospel See D C 68 25 My brothers and sisters I believe that every human soul is teaching something to someone nearly every minute here in mortality May we consider with great reverence the trust that the Lord has placed in us to teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom D C 88 77 May I urge each member of the Church when you are serving as a teacher to remember that every human soul is precious to our Father in Heaven for we are all his children God s children are entitled to be taught the truths of the gospel in clear and understandable terms so that the Spirit can confirm the truths of the gospel to them My plea to the teachers of the Church is to study ponder and pray for guidance in your preparation Use the scriptures and the approved curriculum materials teaching with the objective to bless and inspire the lives of those assigned to you Let us also remember that some of the most effective activation work in the Church is accomplished by those teachers who reach out to the inactive loving and teaching them until they are once again in full fellowship with the Saints To the master teacher the Lord Jesus Christ whose resurrection we celebrate at this Easter time I say I thank thee oh Lord for teaching us that there is no greater call than to be an effective teacher In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My brothers and sisters I have been asked to talk about family finances with you today In times of easy credit and increased inflation many people find that they have too many expenses and too little income One expert estimates that one third of all American families are overextended Last year tens of thousands of families filed for personal bankruptcy A recent survey conducted by the Welfare Services Department provided the following information Fewer than one half of the members surveyed have a year s supply of financial resources and 89 percent feel the burden of increased taxes and inflation Thirty four percent of the Latter day Saint women surveyed are employed outside the home Fifty seven percent of them are working to earn the money they need to meet basic family requirements Thirty one percent of the families are doing without many things and 39 percent are not earning enough money to meet their basic needs These results demonstrate that today we as leaders need to teach our people that they must become efficient managers of their time and resources At the outset as I address this subject I emphasize that the most important principle we must live by today is the principle the prophet Alma taught his son Helaman But behold my son this is not all for ye ought to know as I do know that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land and ye ought to know also that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence Alma 36 30 My experience in the business community taught me that some people can get locked into a daily routine that can stifle their initiative courage and vision From the Bible the greatest teacher of all gave us the secret time and time again He said If thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth Mark 9 23 Brothers and sisters what can we do to improve our family finances May I suggest three important keys that will help us They are attitude planning and self discipline The first key is to have a positive attitude toward ourselves Attitude is an important part of the foundation upon which we build a productive life In appraising our present attitude we might ask Am I working to become my best self Do I set worthy and attainable goals Do I look toward the positive in life Am I alert to ways that I can render more and better service Am I doing more than is required of me Remember a good attitude produces good results a fair attitude fair results a poor attitude poor results We each shape our own life and the shape of it is determined largely by our attitude George Bernard Shaw wrote People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are I don t believe in circumstances The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they can t find them make them Mrs Warren s Profession in Plays by George Bernard Shaw New York New American Library 1960 p 82 Too many people in our country today are developing the attitude that government is obligated to care and provide for them In many ways government has fostered this attitude but the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints know better Some people who lived through the Great Depression and the period following when the government bestowed gratuities upon the people developed a feeling that the world owed them a living In that climate the First Presidency said in 1936 The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves Work is to be re enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership In Conference Report Oct 1936 p 3 The love of work is an attitude that members of the Church must develop In some ways we have gone through a period of great prosperity which may when history is written prove to be as devastating as the Great Depression in its effect upon the attitudes of the people President Harold B Lee said Today we are being tested and tried by another kind of test that I might call the test of gold the test of plenty affluence ease more than perhaps the youth of any generation have passed through at least in this Church Sweet Are the Uses of Adversity Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year Provo 7 Feb 1962 p 3 The love for work needs to be re enthroned in our lives Every family should have a plan for work that touches the lives of each family member so that this eternal principle will be ingrained in their lives Let me share an example from my own life that demonstrates the importance of attitude When I returned from my first mission I went to work for my father as a salesman I was attending the University of Utah and working part time I had a bad two week period in which I earned less than ten dollars My father handed my paycheck to me at a sales meeting in the presence of all the salesmen At the time I thought he was being very hard on me But later I could see that this was his way to help me take a second look at myself I was having a good time and not paying attention to my sales work I determined that never again would I be the lowest paid person My income increased from that day Now what happened I was selling the same merchandise from the same store in the same season of the year What had changed My new attitude made the entire difference William James said that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind See Vital Quotations comp Emerson Roy West Salt Lake City Bookcraft 1968 p 19 Brothers and sisters let us discuss the second key planning which means to think out beforehand how we intend to reach our goals in life Do we all have a plan to increase our value where we are employed Have we taken the time to write down specific goals and have we designed a plan of action to become more effective and productive I learned recently that 75 percent of the hotel and restaurant managers in the Marriott Corporation started with the company as room clerks busboys bellhops or cashiers By improving themselves and their skills they were prepared when opportunities opened to become managers To increase our income we may need to consider additional education We may need to find a way through careful planning to attend night school or trade school or to take a correspondence course Additional education often will improve our skills and increase the value of our services Parents need to teach children very early that a solid financial base is a very important element in a happy home We can do much with our young people to help them find satisfying rewarding employment We should encourage them to do well in their schoolwork and to learn to take advantage of opportunities that will help build a solid base for their future security Children need to explore many employment opportunities when they begin high school Then when they marry and establish a home they will be well on their way to a vocation or a trade that will return an income that will be sufficient to meet their basic needs We might feel that we have gone as far as we can go in our present job If so we should outline a plan of action fast and pray for confirmation and then move forward and make the change in employment A business of our own might increase our income We must be wise however and analyze all factors and seek sound counsel from an attorney accountant banker and most importantly from a businessman who is successfully managing his own company After developing a plan we should pray for guidance and when we receive an inward assurance that we should begin our own business then we should do it Remember the counsel of the Lord For which of you intending to build a tower and I add or business sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it Luke 14 28 The third key is to practice self discipline both at our work and as we attempt to reduce our expenses in our homes Regarding the latter Church leaders should set the example by seeing that stake and ward financial requests are kept to a minimum Members should Avoid debt pooling where exorbitant fees are charged We may want to consolidate debts using a bank or credit union loan that can be repaid at a sensible interest rate over a reasonable length of time We may need to stop using our credit cards Exercise self discipline by telling ourselves We can t afford it and refusing to take on further credit obligations An argument was overheard one day One spouse said while scolding the other for extravagant spending How many times do I have to tell you that spending money before you get it is economically unsound Oh said the other spouse I don t know about that This way if you don t get the money at least you have something to show for it Please be patient and carefully control your purchases so that you will not become enslaved to your creditors Make a budget and stick to it Cut expenses by distinguishing between wants and needs Economize by controlling the use of goods services and energy Increase homemaking skills and have family members complete home and car repairs when feasible Invest wisely Avoid speculations and get rich quick schemes Brothers and sisters every one of us has the potential to improve and increase his earning capacity We are far better off if we can improve and become more valuable on our full time jobs than if we attempt to hold two jobs or to have mothers leave home to join the work force When we learn to expect more success than failure in life we soon will develop an attitude of success Nothing succeeds like success Remember a positive attitude a well thought out plan and consistent self discipline can help us improve our circumstances Applying these keys in our daily work will help produce more income and practicing them in our homes will help reduce expenses When we combine these principles with keeping the commandments of God we can learn to become better managers of our time and resources and become financially secure May the Lord bless all of us to this end I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Since last conference I have come to know that many of our Heavenly Father s children need help with their problems Hundreds of letters filled with pleas for help have come to the General Authorities Fathers plead for their sons mothers for their daughters boys and girls for their parents The contents of these letters have been heartrending I have learned firsthand that the wounds of those who suffer spiritually can be healed when you and I put forth the extra personal effort required to reach out to them Jesus Christ has the power to heal all manner of illness whether spiritual or physical A woman was healed by simply touching the border of his garment as recorded in the book of Luke And Jesus said Somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me And when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately And he said unto her Daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace Luke 8 46 48 Can the Master touch others lives through you and me Oh yes he can and he will if we will just do our part A home teacher in Florida let the Savior s touch be felt in this way I quote excerpts from a letter to me dated July 8 1980 When I joined the Church in 1973 my husband did not join He didn t want to come to meetings and he wasn t sure there was a God anyway In 1975 our home teacher became my husband s best friend For more than three years he missed coming only once My husband found in our home teacher someone to talk to He unburdened his years of bitterness and unhappiness He had never had a real friend before in his entire life In August 1978 our home teacher told us he was moving We were heartbroken On his last visit our home teacher with my husband s permission talked about how one can gain a testimony In November Elder Ballard you came to our stake and taught the gospel at a special fireside My husband and I attended and at the conclusion of the meeting you put your arm around my husband and the Lord spoke through you You told my husband that our Heavenly Father loved him and wanted him to be baptized and that the Church needed him That night my husband made a decision to be baptized We called our former home teacher now living in Louisiana to see when he could come to baptize my husband He came and baptized him One year later he was with us and our family when we were sealed for time and eternity in the Washington Temple Although you may not remember us for we know you meet many people every year our lives were touched in an unforgettable way We are especially grateful to our faithful home teacher In another instance a Young Women teacher had a blind girl in her class whose participation was limited because she could not study in the usual way The teacher would go to the girl s home and read out loud while the girl translated her personal progress book into braille The work took two years The teacher also encouraged the other girls in the class to help Under her direction they went to the blind girl s home and read to her from the manual until it was translated into braille The Master s touch through that teacher reached out and blessed not only this girl but many others who are blind because the braille translation is available at the general offices of the Young Women organization Sometimes the Savior s touch can reach others through little bodies with big hearts A lovely woman had received the missionary discussions but had not made the final commitment to be baptized One Sunday she decided to attend sacrament meeting in a ward where she was not acquainted She wanted a place where she could be alone with her thoughts She sat beside a little boy As the sacrament was passed this little boy noticed that she did not take the sacrament bread When it came to him he carefully broke it in two and gave half to her The woman was very impressed that a child would perform such a meaningful act of kindness That day she contacted the missionaries and said If this is what you teach the children in your church I want to become a member The Lord taught the Nephites Therefore hold up your light that it may shine unto the world Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up 3 Ne 18 24 A recent example of the light of the Lord touching someone who needed it desperately came when I called upon a very close friend shortly after the death of his eternal companion I asked him What can I now do to help He answered Help my son to understand You see this son loved his mother very much When he saw her suffer month after month he began to feel that the prayers and the priesthood blessings went unanswered This caused his faith in our Heavenly Father to waiver and he lost the light of the Lord in his life The words rang in my ears Help my son to understand I asked myself How What can I do Finally I invited him to come to Church headquarters to talk with me When he arrived and we went to the lunchroom a most unusual circumstance unfolded while we were eating During our visit many General Authorities came by our table and greeted us Most importantly he shook hands with eight of the Twelve Apostles that sit here on the stand Never before or since have I seen that many members of the Twelve in the lunchroom at one time As we were leaving the Church offices another unusual thing happened We caught a glimpse of President Kimball and my young friend asked Does President Kimball ever talk to someone like me Circumstances that would rarely happen again placed us with President Kimball for a few minutes The short time with him was unforgettably impressive His instructions were eternal and his love for this young man was unquestionable My friend s heart and mine were touched deeply during those few minutes President Kimball s final statement to this young man after giving him a loving embrace impressed my friend very much He said My boy when you come home from your mission you will understand more fully the things we have been talking about That day a prophet of God reached out as I suppose only a prophet can Through him the Savior touched the life of my friend and turned him toward the light of the Lord As we returned to the parking area I put my arm around him and said I know that your mother knows you are here today Because of her love and devotion to the Lord and her great love for you I am sure our Heavenly Father has allowed her influence to be felt here today Tears flowed attitudes changed directions became clear and commitments were made What a thrill my brothers and sisters to report a few months later to President Kimball that this fine young man was serving faithfully and diligently as a full time missionary Finally may I share how the Lord will touch our personal lives through our own faith and prayers A beautiful baby girl came to our son s home only to stay with them here on earth for less than five months The love and care given to her by her parents was deeply touching The struggle of this infant granddaughter for life was almost more than we could bear The night before her passing we went to the Logan hospital giving what support we could to our children Later that evening in my son s home his mother and I knelt with him and prayed for guidance When we returned to the hospital and I took my tiny little grandchild s hand and looked at her I felt the Savior s touch Into my mind came the words as though spoken by her to me Don t worry grandpa I ll be all right Peace came into my heart The Master s touch fell upon all of us Soon thereafter she was released to go home again to her heavenly parents Oh yes brothers and sisters we can feel the Savior s touch and we can help others feel that divine touch We can bless each other by reaching out to the wayward youth the inactive adult the widowed the aged the sick and to all of God s children everywhere member and nonmember of the Church alike We somehow need to realize the vital importance of feeling the blessings of the gospel and the peace of the Lord in our lives individually That is much more significant than how well the mechanics of a program may be working in our wards and stakes Oh that every parent teacher and Church leader would know that we can bless each other when we administer the Savior s touch to the benefit of our fellowmen I realize that many of you are very conscious of the needs of others I also know that you and I can do much more Let us make the choice never to let a day pass without striving to touch the life of someone through our service Then we can cherish and appreciate more the Savior s beautiful admonition Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me Matt 25 40 I bear testimony that Jesus is the Christ the Son of the living God that he touched the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith and that through him the fulness of the gospel has been restored to the earth to bless and guide all mankind This witness and testimony I bear in the sacred and beloved name of Jesus Christ amen 
This is a great honor for me to address you my brethren and I seek the Spirit of the Lord that what I say might help each of us want to become better members of the Church and serve more diligently in the priesthood I had an extremely frightening experience several years ago while flying from Reno Nevada to San Rafael California with a friend in his twin engine Aztec airplane When we left Reno the weather was a little cloudy and my friend was somewhat worried about it Because of his concern we landed at the Lake Tahoe airport to get a second report on the weather It did not indicate that the weather was too bad so we continued our flight to San Rafael Our destination was an airport in the northern part of San Francisco Bay As we approached the Bay area the clouds became increasingly low and dense We tried to stay under the clouds so we could see the water and thus keep our bearings visually But suddenly we flew into very dense clouds and could see nothing When you fly into such clouds you become totally disoriented You do not know whether you are flying straight sideways or upside down You lose your sense of forward motion and it takes a few minutes for the pilot to orient himself from visual flying to instrument flying At 180 miles an hour you move a long distance in that few minutes and can get into serious trouble very quickly Unfortunately my friend had not flown entirely on instruments for two years My friend struggled intensely and was near the point of panic as he tried to recall all that he had learned about instrument flying I knew very little about instrument flying so I could not help him All I could do was put my hand on his shoulder and tell him to take a deep breath and get hold of himself The only instrument that I could read was the altimeter I said We are now at 500 feet Don t make any quick moves just think it out and you can pull us through It seemed an eternity before he finally made radio contact with Hamilton Air Force Base He said to them I am in trouble please help me The air traffic controllers had us on their radar screen and immediately began to help my friend regain control of the plane They told us where we were and started to give us instructions to help guide us to safety When my friend heard the voice from Hamilton Tower he regained a sense of confidence that enabled him to gain control But he knew that the plane was completely out of control and that our chances of pulling out of this danger were marginal We could easily go the wrong way The foothills buildings towers and bridges were not far away At one time we dropped to only 200 feet and must have been flying upside down at one time because the maps and other items in the visor above my head fell into my lap At the peak of this crisis an instant replay of my entire life flashed through my mind I thought of my wife my seven children my parents my business partners the 37 priests whom I was the adviser to and many other things I prayed fervently all through this crisis and made a commitment more deep and more sincere than ever before in my life I began Heavenly Father guide us out of this thick dense cloud and help my friend remember all he knows about instrument flying And then I said In the name of Jesus Christ and by the power of the holy priesthood bless my friend that he might regain control My prayer continued I committed to Heavenly Father that if he would help us I would place my life in his hands I promised him that I would be what he wanted me to be Finally we saw the lights on the runway The white line in the center of the runway was a most welcome sight Every priesthood bearer sitting in this priesthood meeting tonight has a great work to do Each one of us has the power to demonstrate to our Heavenly Father that we really love him and desire to serve him with all of our hearts Let me show how each of us can make a sincere and meaningful commitment to Heavenly Father right now Please find a small piece of paper and a pencil Borrow from your neighbor if you need to Now brethren write on your piece of paper the name of one inactive or nonmember man or boy who lives in your ward Will you make a commitment tonight that you will do all in your power with the help of the Lord to lead that person out of darkness into the full light of the gospel You can be to him as the voice from Hamilton Tower was to my friend and me and you can guide him safely into full fellowship in the Church of Jesus Christ Just a few months after I made my full commitment to the Lord that I would give my life to his service if he so desired I was presiding over the Canada Toronto Mission During that mission President Kimball called me to spend the rest of my life in the service of the Lord as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy No work is more important than helping bring the gospel into the lives of our brothers and sisters You and I have no better way to demonstrate our love for the Lord than to personally lead someone into the safety of full activity in the Church I want to help you keep the commitment that you have just made brethren I invite you to write to me when you feel the time has come that you need some additional help Send me the name and address of the man or the boy whom you seek to rescue and I will write a letter of encouragement to him I am sure that my brethren of the General Authorities will help me if I receive more letters than I can answer because they are fully committed to helping you and me meet our righteous commitments The Lord has said in the Doctrine and Covenants Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God For behold the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh wherefore he suffered the pain of all men that all men might repent and come unto him And he hath risen again from the dead that he might bring all unto him on conditions of repentance And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people and bring save it be one soul unto me how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father D C 18 10 13 15 The light of the Lord is real my brethren He will lead every soul out of the clouds of darkness and away from the fog of doubt and uncertainty with a perfect eternal signal that will guarantee safety peace and confidence He said to all the world Come follow me Mark 10 21 and I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life John 8 12 Life s flight pattern can be changed The instruments we use in saving souls are love and sharing our testimonies of the divine mission of our Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ Thousands of our lost brethren both men and boys can be led to a safe landing if we will keep the commitments that we have made tonight The power of the priesthood that is within each one of us is a greater power than any radar radio or any other communication system Nothing is more important to the Lord than saving souls God bless us to keep this commitment my brethren to bring into full fellowship one precious son of God I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
On behalf of all of us I d like to say we love you President Young Recently I held our first grandchild in my arms and had the same feelings come to me that I had when I held each one of my own children shortly after their birth As I looked into their innocent faces these questions came into my mind Who are you my little one What does Heavenly Father want you to accomplish in this life I imagine that many of you parents have had the same thoughts as you have held your infant children I wonder if Spencer W Kimball s father had any idea when he first held this infant son that into his home had come a spirit ordained in the premortal life to someday grow in such spiritual strength and power that he would sit in this great conference today as our prophet and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints It is possible my brothers and sisters that among the little ones in your homes and in your care are spirit children that were sent to you to be trained and prepared to fulfill callings as General Authorities stake presidents bishops Relief Society or Primary presidents In someone s home there is a little one sent from our Heavenly Father that someday will be called to sit in the seat where our great prophet now sits Whoever is training our prophet of the future generations please train him well Teach him to love the Lord the scriptures and his fellowmen as President Kimball loves us today What can we do to better prepare our children spiritually for their eternal roles Perhaps the most inclusive answer is Teach them how to live the principles of the gospel To be good teachers we must learn to be better listeners Let me share one personal example Our first child Clark when he was four years old appeared to be guilty of some minor wrongdoing that at the time seemed to require some sound fatherly counsel I took him into the bedroom and talked to him about why he must not ever again do what I had predetermined that he had done When I concluded my great discourse this little brown eyed boy looked into my eyes and said But Daddy I didn t do it Through his eyes his spirit talked to me and I knew that he was telling me the truth I embraced him and asked for his forgiveness His spirit though in a four year old mortal body spoke loudly to me that day and I learned from him a great lesson Always be a good listener Oh how important it is for parents to understand the eternal plan of our Heavenly Father as he sends his spirit children here and entrusts them to us for a few short years Just think of it Within every human body dwells a living spirit born to our loving eternal heavenly parents When parents know this they can better guide their families by focusing upon the eternal relationships and the true purposes of this life No thinking parent would ever allow any verbal or physical abuse of their children to creep into their home and destroy the destiny of their eternal family Some children receive mortal bodies with limitations that might restrict their physical activities but not their spiritual development In the Lord s eternal plan perhaps the spiritual growth of other family members required the presence of a child with some physical limitation Just this month a lovely family shared with me this poem written for their little girl She looks into the world darkly Though spiritual things do not hide Chosen to affliction bear As viewed from the mortal side Her spirit is not burdened To Heavenly Father she s perfectly whole Who and how great she is On this side cannot be told She s a very special spirit In a very special place Those who have looked upon her Have seen an angel s face I stand in awe when I consider the great confidence Heavenly Father has placed in you and me when he allows us the privilege of being the mortal fathers and mothers to his eternal spirit offspring We must never forget that he has a vested interest in every one of us and we must realize how important each human soul is in God s eternal plan When we understand the importance of each soul we can go before him confidently in prayer to seek his guidance and direction in our sacred assignment as parents He said This is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 This seems to me to best sum up the important role that mortal parents have in the great eternal plan of life for each member of our families I believe that most mortal bodies grow to physical maturity with a relatively simple effort on the part of parents When we see that our children receive the proper rest food and exercise we find that the physical body generally grows into full maturity on schedule As the maturing process continues we start to notice that the physical body begins to age Wrinkles appear where the skin was smooth Most hair turns gray thins out a bit and then ultimately turns white The process of aging continues and results in death The eternal spirit of man then leaves its mortal home to return and report to our Heavenly Father Some parents become so expert at filling every physical desire for their children that they begin to suppose that all is well in this life and that their eternal stewardship is progressing right on schedule I have noticed that some children living in too much luxury can lose their sense of spiritual values and misplace their eternal priorities I believe that we must pause and take a careful inventory to determine how well our families are doing spiritually We could ask how well are we feeding nurturing training and exercising the spirits of our children or how well have we taught trained loved and inspired our children to build their spiritual muscles and strength We are given many teaching moments and the Church has given us the special family home evening to help us accomplish this purpose Remember eternity is now not a vague distant future We prepare each day right now for eternal life If we are not preparing for eternal life we are preparing for something else perhaps something far less I have noticed that the spirit of man is not like the body as it grows older but rather is just the opposite If the spirit of man is properly cared for rather than becoming slower to move and less capable as the body does the spirit becomes more confident and waxes strong in the presence of God See D C 121 45 Through the eyes of the strong in spirit we can feel their power and strength Those of us who are blessed to know the First Presidency and the members of the Council of the Twelve can witness that the age of their physical bodies has no relationship to the capacity of their spirits I testify that when you clasp the hand of one of these brethren you feel the power and the strength of the spirit that is within them and you realize that through years of obedient living of the gospel they have developed their spirits to such a degree that they now can strengthen the entire Church I know that thousands of our Saints have learned that spiritual growth is the most important part of life How blessed are children who are raised by parents that understand and teach this to them My message then is this We must carefully and conscientiously provide solid spiritual training for the eternal growth of our children Thoughtful planning will be required because providing spiritual development for them is not quite as simple as meeting their physical needs The prophets of the Lord both ancient and modern have given clear instruction to you and me Moses gave us the basic Ten Commandments The Savior added to these instructions and gave to us the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ In 1820 our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son appeared personally to the Prophet Joseph and set in motion the restoration of the fulness of the gospel with all of the necessary priesthood powers to act in their names in spiritual matters As one becomes more familiar with the revelations both ancient and modern the evidence is overwhelming that our Heavenly Father is much more concerned with the proper spiritual growth of his children than with the physical It is beautiful to know that if we can build upon a solid spiritual foundation if we can repent of our sins and grow in wisdom knowledge and understanding we can enjoy dwelling in the presence of our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son Jesus Christ forever and ever This is eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of God see D C 14 7 I know God lives and that all men are his children I testify that Jesus is the Christ and if all men will seek to know the truth and follow his example we will be able to live up to the spiritual expectations of our Heavenly Father May we be blessed so to do I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen 
My brothers and sisters my coming to conference while serving as a full time mission president makes me feel somewhat like an army field commander who has been summoned home from the front lines to report on conditions of the war to the commander in chief joint chiefs of staff and other general officers The war is not a hot one where there are guns and armaments but the struggle between the forces of righteousness and of evil for the souls of our Heavenly Father s children is intense and the conflict is very real From my front line position in the mission field I can personally testify that the enemy is well trained in the arts of eternal warfare The army of the devil exploits all kinds of sinful practices and promotes his cause through every kind of printed audio and visual means Perhaps the most cunning of all their methods is the spirit of apathy and indifference that they use to penetrate the minds and the hearts of mankind to dull their feelings towards God His Son Jesus Christ and His church The great prophet Mormon taught Wherefore all things which are good cometh of God and that which is evil cometh of the devil for the devil is an enemy unto God and fighteth against him continually and inviteth and enticeth to sin and to do that which is evil continually Moro 7 12 Based on my experience I believe that if the Saints and missionaries are to build up the Church at the much faster rate that President Kimball has called for we must all strive to prepare ourselves to become better gospel teachers I often see the great joy that comes into the life of the new member of the Church when he is baptized At each baptismal service I am reminded of the tremendous amount of individual preparation that is required by both member and missionary to bring about the conversion of one soul I have asked myself What can we as parents and leaders do to more effectively teach our youth how to defend the principles of righteousness Better training and preparation seem to me to be the best answer Realizing that I would need all the help I could get to give my first conference talk I went to my wonderful missionaries and asked them to help me by answering a few questions about their pre mission preparation I think we may learn something from their answers My first question was What could you have done to better prepare yourself before your mission My missionaries responded with comments like these I could have really read and studied the scriptures paid more attention in seminary and other Church classes learned how to pray and relate to the Lord started much earlier to build my testimony May I suggest to all of the youth of the Church that I believe you can come into the mission field loaded with knowledge about the eternal truths of the gospel knowing for yourself that Jesus is the Christ and that His church has been restored to the earth through a living prophet and that the Book of Mormon is the word of God I like these words of Nephi Wherefore I said unto you feast upon the words of Christ for behold the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do 2 Ne 32 3 Young people why not make the best investment of your life by spending more of your time now to study and learn for yourself the ways of the Lord If you will do this now you will arrive in the mission field with the Spirit of the Lord as your companion and you will be filled with the desire to enthusiastically and intelligently teach the gospel to the people May the Lord bless every one of you who will be a missionary with a clear view of your own self worth and the vision of your own important role that you play in this great work May the roots of your testimony be driven down deep through your pre mission preparation so when the winds of adversity blow upon you you will be able to weather the storm and be able to make your very best contribution to the growth of this great Church I then asked my missionaries What could your father have done to better prepare you Here are a few of their answers He could have taught me more about the priesthood taught me to understand that the priesthood is the power by which the cause of righteousness moves forward given me a father s blessing taught me how to budget my money taught me how to set and reach goals prayed with me and shared with me his testimony May I share a personal missionary experience Shortly after we arrived in Toronto we were preparing the children to enroll in their schools My five year old son was to start kindergarten but on the first day he was afraid to go My wife and I were concerned and I was impressed to invite my son to come into my office and sit in what the missionaries call the hot seat and we would have an interview He climbed up into the big black chair and I asked Son how can I help you I shall never forget as long as I live the look of real concern on his face With his little chin quivering he said Daddy I am afraid I understood for I knew he had left behind several friends of his same age and so far he had found no one his age near the mission home I said Craig you have a friend that will always be with you Let s kneel down together and ask Him to help you We did and Craig assigned me to say the prayer The Lord helped Craig find his courage in this experience Every morning thereafter we held our interview and every morning I was assigned to pray Then one morning about two weeks later there came no knock at my office door no special father and son prayer He had found his confidence and made some friends and I was the one that missed that very special experience each morning with my little boy I hope that this choice learning experience while on this mission will remain with Craig and become a source of strength to him when he is called to serve the Lord on a mission of his own Fathers you are the first line priesthood leader and almost without exception my missionaries expressed their love and respect for you There is no one in the world that can prepare and train the future missionaries of the Church like you can To you wonderful mothers of the Church listen to the response of my elders to this question What could my mother have done to better prepare me They said Somehow Mom should have insisted that I pay more attention when she was trying to teach me about housekeeping cooking cleaning laundry bargain shopping personal hygiene mending quick recipes to name just a few To be an effective missionary one must be spiritually in tune but the temporal well being of the missionary becomes far more important than perhaps most of us realize Mothers teach your children to be sensitive and aware of the needs of others Teach them to know and to practice basic principles of good human relations May I suggest to you wonderful mothers that you put your arms around your children look them squarely in the eye and tell them to learn these skills because you want them to be happy and successful on their mission What son or daughter will not respond to the loving eyes of his or her mother In the survey my missionaries expressed their love for their leaders and suggested that their stake presidents bishops advisors and teachers could have prepared them better if they would have explained to them in realistic terms what is expected of a missionary had more frequent and in depth interviews helped them make their commitment to the Lord earlier taught them from and stressed the importance of the scriptures and taught them the power of a positive and enthusiastic attitude If our missionaries could be taught more of these principles before coming on a mission I believe that their stride would be lengthened at the outset and the pace of the work would be quickened in the beginning because they would start right out on the first day of their mission prepared to teach the gospel by the power of the Holy Spirit President Kimball said to the mission presidents that left for the field in 1974 Evangelistic harvest is always urgent The destiny of man and of nations is always being decided Every generation is crucial every generation is strategic We may not be responsible for past generations but we cannot escape full responsibility for this one and we have our time and our generation and our missionaries and our great potential Mission Presidents Seminar June 27 1974 Our great potential is to prepare the world for eternal living in the presence of our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ and to do this we must teach the gospel to all the people of the earth To you our nonmember friends please stop and take a moment to ask yourself Where did I come from Why am I here on this earth Where will I go when I die Today I have suggested to the members and missionaries of the Church that we all strive harder to prepare ourselves to be better able to share and to teach to you what we know to be true We love you and ask you to please listen to our message for we teach the true gospel of Jesus Christ by the power of the only divinely recognized priesthood on this earth today We can answer your questions and we will place before you the evidence that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth so you can decide for yourself if we teach to you the truth We will give to you the Book of Mormon that you might read for yourself to know that this second witness of the Lord Jesus Christ is in very deed the word of God like unto the Bible and it testifies to the truthfulness of our message My dear friends no people on this earth are striving harder to prepare themselves to be able to effectively teach the gospel of Jesus Christ than are the members of this church and we ask you to please take time to listen to the glorious message of the Restoration I testify to you that we are the only true church of Jesus Christ on the earth today and one of our great missions in this life as members of the Church is to share the gospel truths with all of our Heavenly Father s children May the Lord bless each one of us that our ears may hear and our eyes might be opened that together we may learn to live the gospel and find the joy that only the gospel can give to us I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ Amen 
My dear brethren I am grateful that Brother Asay has echoed my feelings for me I am also grateful to know that I m not the only one whose heart is throbbing up in his throat As I contemplated the possibility of bearing my testimony tonight to you my mind went back to many years ago when I was in the Aaronic Priesthood and somehow I and one of my companions found ourselves over here by the stairs where we didn t belong just prior to the beginning of the priesthood meeting President George Albert Smith in his kindly way saw our plight saw that we really had nowhere to go and invited us to sit on these stairs by the pulpit I sat there with my friend and watched the proceedings of that great priesthood session never believing that I would ever again get that close to this pulpit I remember that I said to my friend when we left the conference It sure would be nice to be a General Authority then you would have one of those big red chairs to sit in I would like to say my brethren that I have been sitting in a big red chair for just a few minutes and the greatest desire of my heart is that I will learn through my obedience and my service to become comfortable in that big red chair I pray that the Lord will bless me that I might properly represent President Kimball his counselors the Council of the Twelve and all my brethren of the General Authorities that as they send me forth on whatever errand it might be I might do the will and the bidding of the Lord I thank my wife my seven children my mother and father for making this calling possible I pledge my full support and loyalty to my brethren and to the Lord and ask for his peace and blessing to be with me as I grow in my assignment I have a great testimony of the gospel for I know that it is true I bring the greetings of the Saints in eastern Canada and all the missionaries there to all brethren of the priesthood around the world I leave this testimony humbly and in the worthy name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen
