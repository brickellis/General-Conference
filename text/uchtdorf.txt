My dear brothers and sisters my dear friends each week members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints all around the globe worship our beloved Heavenly Father the God and King of the universe and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ We ponder the life and teachings of Jesus Christ the only sinless soul who ever lived the spotless Lamb of God As often as we can we partake of the sacrament in remembrance of His sacrifice and recognize that He is the center in our lives We love Him and we honor Him Because of His profound and eternal love Jesus Christ suffered and died for you and me He broke open the gates of death shattered the barriers that separated friends and loved ones 1 and brought hope to the hopeless healing to the sick and deliverance to the captive 2To Him we dedicate our hearts our lives and our daily devotion For this reason we talk of Christ we rejoice in Christ and we preach of Christ that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins 3Practicing DiscipleshipHowever being a disciple of Jesus Christ involves much more than talking and preaching of Christ The Savior Himself restored His Church to help us on the path to become more like Him The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is structured to provide opportunities to practice the fundamentals of discipleship Through our participation in the Church we learn to recognize and act on the promptings of the Holy Spirit We develop the disposition of reaching out in compassion and kindness to others This is an effort of a lifetime and it requires practice Accomplished athletes spend countless hours practicing the fundamentals of their sports Nurses networkers nuclear engineers and even I as a competitive hobby cook in Harriet s kitchen become capable and skilled only as we diligently practice our craft As an airline captain I often trained pilots using a flight simulator a sophisticated machine that replicates the flying experience The simulator not only helps pilots learn the fundamentals of flying it also allows them to experience and react to unexpected events they could encounter when they take command of the real aircraft The same principles apply for disciples of Jesus Christ Actively participating in the Church of Jesus Christ and its great variety of opportunities will help us to be better prepared for life s changing circumstances whatever and however serious they may be As members of the Church we are encouraged to immerse ourselves in the words of God through His prophets ancient and modern Through sincere and humble prayer to our Heavenly Father we learn to recognize the voice of the Holy Spirit We accept calls to serve teach plan minister and administer These opportunities allow us to grow in spirit mind and character They will help us prepare to make and keep sacred covenants that will bless us in this life and in the life to come Come Join with Us We invite all of God s children throughout the world to join us in this great endeavor Come and see Even during this challenging time of COVID 19 meet with us online Meet with our missionaries online Find out for yourself what this Church is all about When this difficult time has passed meet with us in our homes and in our worship places We invite you to come and help Come and serve with us ministering to God s children following in the footsteps of the Savior and making this world a better place Come and belong You will make us stronger And you will become better kinder and happier as well Your faith will deepen and grow more resilient more capable of withstanding the turbulences and unexpected trials of life And how do we start There are many possible ways We invite you to read the Book of Mormon If you don t have a copy you can read it on ChurchofJesusChrist org4 or download the Book of Mormon app The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ and a companion to the Old and New Testaments We love all of these holy scriptures and learn from them We invite you to spend some time at ComeuntoChrist org to find out what members of the Church teach and believe Invite the missionaries to visit with you online or in the privacy of your home where this is possible they have a message of hope and healing These missionaries are our precious sons and daughters who serve in many places around the world on their own time and money In the Church of Jesus Christ you will find a family of people who are not so different from you You will find people who need your help and who want to help you as you strive to become the best version of yourself the person God created you to become The Savior s Embrace Extends to AllYou might be thinking I have made mistakes in my life I m not sure I could ever feel like I belong in the Church of Jesus Christ God couldn t be interested in someone like me Jesus the Christ though He is the King of kings 5 the Messiah the Son of the living God 6 does care deeply about each and every one of God s children He cares regardless of a person s position how poor or rich how imperfect or proven someone is During His mortal life the Savior ministered to all to the happy and accomplished to the broken and lost and to those without hope Often the people He served and ministered to were not individuals of prominence beauty or wealth Often the people He lifted up had little to offer in return but gratitude a humble heart and the desire to have faith If Jesus spent His mortal life ministering to the least of these 7 would He not love them today Is there not a place in His Church for all of God s children Even for those who feel unworthy forgotten or alone There is no threshold of perfection you must attain in order to qualify for God s grace Your prayers do not have to be loud or eloquent or grammatically correct in order to reach heaven In truth God does not show favoritism8 the things the world values mean nothing to Him He knows your heart and He loves you regardless of your title financial net worth or number of Instagram followers As we incline our hearts to our Heavenly Father and draw near to Him we will feel Him draw near to us 9We are His beloved children Even those who reject Him Even those who like a headstrong unruly child become angry with God and His Church pack their bags and storm out the door proclaiming that they re running away and never coming back When a child runs away from home he or she may not notice the concerned parents looking out the window With tender hearts they watch their son or daughter go hoping their precious child will learn something from this heartrending experience and perhaps see life with new eyes and eventually return home So it is with our loving Heavenly Father He is waiting for our return Your Savior tears of love and compassion in His eyes awaits your return Even when you feel far away from God He will see you He will have compassion for you and run to embrace you 10Come and belong God Allows Us to Learn from Our MistakesWe are pilgrims walking the road of mortality in a grand search for meaning and ultimate truth Often all we see is the path directly ahead we cannot see where the bends in the road will lead Our loving Heavenly Father has not given us every answer He expects us to figure out many things for ourselves He expects us to believe even when it s difficult to do so He expects us to straighten our shoulders and develop a little resolve a little backbone and take another step forward That is the way we learn and grow Would you honestly want everything spelled out in every detail Would you honestly want every question answered Every destination mapped out I believe most of us would tire very quickly of this sort of heavenly micromanagement We learn the important lessons of life through experience Through learning from our mistakes Through repenting and realizing for ourselves that wickedness never was happiness 11Jesus Christ the Son of God died so that our mistakes might not condemn us and forever halt our progress Because of Him we can repent and our mistakes can become stepping stones to greater glory You don t have to walk this road alone Our Heavenly Father has not left us to wander in darkness This is why in the spring of 1820 He appeared with His Son Jesus Christ to a young man Joseph Smith Think of that for a moment The God of the universe appeared to man This was the first of many encounters Joseph had with God and other heavenly beings Many of the words these divine beings spoke to him are recorded in the scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints They are easily accessible Anyone can read them and learn for themselves the message God has for us in our day We invite you to study them for yourself Joseph Smith was quite young when he received these revelations Most of them came before he was 30 years old 12 He lacked experience and to some people he probably seemed underqualified to be the Lord s prophet And yet the Lord called him anyway following a pattern we find throughout the holy scriptures God didn t wait to find a perfect person to restore His gospel If He had He would still be waiting Joseph was a lot like you and me Though Joseph made mistakes God used him to accomplish His great purposes President Thomas S Monson often repeated these words of advice Whom the Lord calls the Lord qualifies 13The Apostle Paul reasoned with the Saints in Corinth Consider your own call brothers and sisters not many of you were wise by human standards not many were powerful not many were of noble birth 14God uses the weak and the plain to bring about His purposes This truth stands as a testimony that it is God s power not man s that accomplishes His work on the earth 15Hear Him Follow HimWhen God appeared to Joseph Smith He introduced His Son Jesus Christ and said Hear Him 16Joseph spent the rest of his life hearing Him and following Him As with Joseph our discipleship begins with our decision to hear and follow the Savior Jesus Christ If you desire to follow Him gather your faith and take upon yourself His cross You will find that you do belong in His Church a place of warmth and welcoming where you can join in the grand pursuit of discipleship and happiness It is my hope that in this bicentennial year of the First Vision as we contemplate and learn of the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ we will realize that it is not just a historical event You and I play a crucial part in this great continuing story What then is your and my part It is to learn of Jesus Christ To study His words To hear Him and to follow Him by actively participating in this great work I invite you to come and belong You don t have to be perfect You only have to have a desire to develop your faith and draw nearer to Him each day Our part is to love and serve God and to love and serve God s children As you do so God will encircle you with His love joy and certain guidance through this life even under the most serious circumstances and even beyond Of this I testify and leave you my blessing in deep gratitude and love for each one of you in the sacred name of our Savior our Master in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Of HobbitsA beloved children s fantasy novel written many years ago begins with the sentence In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit 1The story of Bilbo Baggins is about a most normal and unremarkable hobbit who is presented with a most remarkable opportunity the wonderful chance at adventure and the promise of a great reward The problem is that most self respecting hobbits want nothing to do with adventures Their lives are all about comfort They enjoy eating six meals a day when they can get them and spend their days in their gardens swapping tales with visitors singing playing musical instruments and basking in the simple joys of life However when Bilbo is presented with the prospect of a grand adventure something surges deep within his heart He understands from the outset that the journey will be challenging Even dangerous There is even a possibility he might not return And yet the call to adventure has reached deep into his heart And so this unremarkable hobbit leaves comfort behind and enters the path to a great adventure that will take him all the way to there and back again 2Your AdventurePerhaps one of the reasons this story resonates with so many is because it is our story too Long long ago even before we were born in an age dimmed by time and clouded from memory we too were invited to embark on an adventure It was proposed by God our Heavenly Father Accepting this adventure would mean leaving the comfort and security of His immediate presence It would mean coming to earth for a journey filled with unknown danger and trial We knew it would not be easy But we also knew that we would gain precious treasures including a physical body and experiencing the intense joys and sorrows of mortality We would learn to strive to seek and to struggle We would discover truths about God and ourselves Of course we knew we would make many mistakes along the way But we also had a promise that because of the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ we could be cleansed of our transgressions refined and purified in our spirits and one day resurrected and reunited with those we love We learned how much God loves us He gave us life and He wants us to succeed Therefore He prepared a Savior for us Nevertheless our Father in Heaven said thou mayest choose for thyself for it is given unto thee 3There must have been parts of the mortal adventure that worried and even terrified God s children since a large number of our spiritual brothers and sisters decided against it 4By the gift and power of moral agency we determined that the potential of what we could learn and eternally become was well worth the risk 5And so trusting the promises and power of God and His Beloved Son we accepted the challenge I did And so did you We agreed to leave the security of our first estate and embark on our own great adventure of there and back again The Call to AdventureAnd yet mortal life has a way of distracting us doesn t it We tend to lose sight of our great quest preferring comfort and ease over growth and progress Still there remains something undeniable deep within our hearts that hungers for a higher and nobler purpose This hunger is one reason why people are drawn to the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ The restored gospel is in a sense a renewal of the call to adventure we accepted so long ago The Savior invites us each day to set aside our comforts and securities and join Him on the journey of discipleship There are many bends in this road There are hills valleys and detours There may even be metaphorical spiders trolls and even a dragon or two But if you stay on the path and trust in God you will eventually find the way to your glorious destiny and back to your heavenly home So how do you begin It s quite simple Incline Your Heart to GodFirst you need to choose to incline your heart to God Strive each day to find Him Learn to love Him And then let that love inspire you to learn understand and follow His teachings and learn to keep God s commandments The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is given to us in a plain and simple way that a child can understand Yet the gospel of Jesus Christ has the answers to the most complex questions in life and has such profound depth and complexity that even with a lifetime of study and pondering we can scarcely comprehend even the smallest part If you hesitate in this adventure because you doubt your ability remember that discipleship is not about doing things perfectly it s about doing things intentionally It is your choices that show what you truly are far more than your abilities 6Even when you fail you can choose not to give up but rather discover your courage press forward and rise up That is the great test of the journey God knows that you are not perfect that you will fail at times God loves you no less when you struggle than when you triumph Like a loving parent He merely wants you to keep intentionally trying Discipleship is like learning to play the piano Perhaps all you can do at first is play a barely recognizable rendition of Chopsticks But if you continue practicing the simple tunes will one day give way to wondrous sonatas rhapsodies and concertos Now that day may not come during this life but it will come All God asks is that you consciously keep striving Reach Out in Love to OthersThere is something interesting almost paradoxical about this path you ve chosen the only way for you to progress in your gospel adventure is to help others progress as well To help others is the path of discipleship Faith hope love compassion and service refine us as disciples Through your efforts to help the poor and the needy to reach out to those in distress your own character is purified and forged your spirit is enlarged and you walk a little taller But this love cannot come with expectations of repayment It cannot be the kind of service that expects recognition adulation or favor True disciples of Jesus Christ love God and His children without expectation of something in return We love those who disappoint us who don t like us Even those who ridicule abuse and seek to hurt us When you fill your hearts with the pure love of Christ you leave no room for rancor judgment and shaming You keep God s commandments because you love Him In the process you slowly become more Christlike in your thoughts and deeds 7 And what adventure could be greater than this Share Your StoryThe third thing we strive to master in this journey is to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and not be ashamed of being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ We do not hide our faith We do not bury it To the contrary we talk about our journey with others in normal and natural ways That s what friends do they talk about things that are important to them Things that are close to their heart and make a difference to them That s what you do You tell your stories and experiences as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Sometimes your stories make people laugh Sometimes they bring them to tears Sometimes they will help people to continue in patience resilience and courage to face another hour another day and come a little closer to God Share your experiences in person on social media in groups everywhere One of the last things Jesus told His disciples was that they were to go throughout the world and share the story of the risen Christ 8 Today we too joyfully accept that great commission What a glorious message we have to share because of Jesus Christ every man woman and child can return home safely to their heavenly home and there dwell in glory and righteousness There is even more good news to share God has appeared to man in our day We have a living prophet May I remind you that God does not need you to sell the restored gospel or the Church of Jesus Christ He simply expects you not to hide it under a bushel And if people decide the Church is not for them that is their decision It does not mean you have failed You continue to treat them kindly Nor does it exclude that you invite them again The difference between casual social contacts and compassionate courageous discipleship is invitation We love and respect all of God s children regardless of their position in life regardless of their race or religion regardless of their life s decisions For our part we will say Come and see Find out for yourself how walking the path of discipleship will be rewarding and ennobling We invite people to come and help as we try to make the world a better place And we say Come and stay We are your brothers and sisters We are not perfect We trust God and seek to keep His commandments Join with us and you will make us better And in the process you will become better as well Let s take this adventure together When Should I Start When our friend Bilbo Baggins felt the call to adventure stir within him he decided to get a good night s rest enjoy a hearty breakfast and start out first thing in the morning When Bilbo awoke he noticed his house was a mess and he was almost distracted from his noble plan But then his friend Gandalf came and asked Whenever are you going to come 9 To catch up with his friends Bilbo had to decide for himself what to do And so the very normal and unremarkable hobbit found himself darting out his front door to the path of adventure so quickly that he forgot his hat walking stick and pocket handkerchief He even left his second breakfast unfinished Perhaps there is a lesson here for us as well If you and I have felt the stirrings to join the great adventure of living and sharing what our loving Heavenly Father prepared for us a long time ago I assure you today is the day to follow God s Son and our Savior on His path of service and discipleship We could spend a lifetime waiting for that moment when everything lines up perfectly But now is the time to commit fully to seeking God ministering to others and sharing our experience with others Leave behind your hat walking stick handkerchief and messy house 10To those of us already walking that path take courage exercise compassion have confidence and continue To those who have left the path please come back join again with us make us stronger And to those who have not yet begun why delay If you want to experience the wonders of this great spiritual journey set foot upon your own grand adventure Speak with the missionaries Speak with your Latter day Saint friends Speak with them about this marvelous work and a wonder 11It s time to begin Come Join with Us If you sense that your life could have more meaning a higher purpose stronger family bonds and a closer connection with God please come join with us If you seek a community of people who are working to become the best versions of themselves help those in need and make this world a better place come join with us Come and see what this marvelous wondrous and adventurous journey is all about Along the way you will discover yourself You will discover meaning You will discover God You will discover the most adventurous and glorious journey of your life Of this I testify in the name of our Redeemer and Savior Jesus Christ amen 
Last month the Twelve were invited by our dear prophet President Russell M Nelson to travel with him to the dedication of the Rome Italy Temple While traveling I thought about the Apostle Paul and his journeys In his day to get from Jerusalem to Rome it would have taken about 40 days Today in one of my favorite airplanes it takes less than 3 hours Bible scholars believe that Paul was in Rome when he wrote several of his letters which were key in strengthening Church members then as well as today Paul and the other members of the ancient Church the Early day Saints were intimately familiar with sacrifice Many were severely persecuted even unto death In the last 200 years the members of the restored Church of Jesus Christ the Latter day Saints have also experienced persecution in many forms But in spite of that persecution and sometimes because of it The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has continued to grow and is now found all across the globe There Is Much to DoHowever before we bake a cake throw confetti and congratulate ourselves on this remarkable success we would do well to put that growth into perspective There are roughly seven and a half billion people in the world compared to some 16 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints a very small flock indeed 1Meanwhile the numbers of Christian believers in some parts of the world are shrinking 2Even in the Lord s restored Church while overall membership continues to grow there are too many who do not claim the blessings of regular Church participation In other words wherever you are on this earth there are plenty of opportunities to share the good news3 of the gospel of Jesus Christ with people you meet study with and live with or work and socialize with During this past year I have had the exciting opportunity to be deeply involved with the worldwide missionary activities of the Church I have often pondered and prayed about the Savior s great commission to His disciples us His children to go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost 4I wrestled with the question How can we as members and disciples of Christ best fulfill that great commission in our daily lives Today I invite you to ponder that same question in your heart and mind 5A Gift for Missionary WorkChurch leaders have emphasized the clarion call Every member a missionary for decades 6Members of the Church of Jesus Christ both in past times as well as in ours have enthusiastically and joyfully shared the gospel with friends and acquaintances Their hearts are aflame with the testimony of Jesus Christ and they sincerely want others to experience the same joy they have found in the Savior s gospel Some members of the Church seem to have a gift for this They love being ambassadors of the gospel They boldly and gladly serve and lead the work as member missionaries However others of us are more hesitant When missionary work is discussed in Church meetings heads are slowly lowered until submerged behind the pew eyes focused on the scriptures or closed in deep meditation to avoid eye contact with other members Why is this Maybe we feel guilty for not doing more to share the gospel Perhaps we feel uncertain about how to do it Or we might feel timid about going outside our comfort zone I understand this But remember the Lord has never required expert flawless missionary efforts Instead the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind 7If you are already happily doing missionary work please continue and stand as an example to others The Lord will bless you If however you feel that you have been dragging your feet when it comes to sharing the gospel message may I suggest five guilt free things anyone can do to participate in the Savior s great commission to help gather Israel Five Simple SuggestionsFirst draw close to God The first great commandment is to love God 8 It is a primary reason why we are on this earth Ask yourself Do I really believe in Heavenly Father Do I love and trust Him The closer you draw to our Heavenly Father the more His light and joy will shine from within you Others will notice that there is something unique and special about you And they will ask about it Second fill your heart with love for others This is the second great commandment 9 Try to truly see everyone around you as a child of God Minister to them regardless of whether their names appear on your ministering sister or brother list Laugh with them Rejoice with them Weep with them Respect them Heal lift and strengthen them Strive to emulate the love of Christ and have compassion for others even to those who are unkind to you who mock you and wish to cause you harm Love them and treat them as fellow children of Heavenly Father Third strive to walk the path of discipleship As your love for God and His children deepens so does your commitment to follow Jesus Christ You learn about His way by feasting upon His word and heeding and applying the teachings of modern prophets and apostles You grow in confidence and courage to follow His way as you communicate with Heavenly Father with a teachable humble heart Walking the path of discipleship takes practice each day little by little grace for grace 10 line upon line 11 Sometimes two steps forward and one step back The important thing is that you don t give up keep trying to get it right You will eventually become better happier and more authentic Talking with others about your faith will become normal and natural In fact the gospel will be such an essential precious part of your lives that it would feel unnatural not to talk about it with others That may not happen immediately it is a lifelong effort But it will happen Fourth share what is in your heart I am not asking that you stand on a street corner with a megaphone and shout out Book of Mormon verses What I am asking is that you always look for opportunities to bring up your faith in natural and normal ways with people both in person as well as online I am asking that you stand as witnesses 12 of the power of the gospel at all times and when necessary use words 13Because the gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation you can be confident courageous and humble as you share it 14 Confidence courage and humility may seem like contradictory attributes but they are not They reflect the Savior s invitation not to hide gospel values and principles under a bushel but to let your light shine that your good works may glorify your Father in Heaven 15There are many normal and natural ways to do this from daily acts of kindness to personal testimonials on YouTube Facebook Instagram or Twitter to simple conversations with people you meet This year we are learning from the New Testament in our homes and in Sunday School What a marvelous opportunity to invite friends and neighbors to church and your homes to learn about the Savior with you Share with them the Gospel Library app where they can find Come Follow Me If you know young people and their families give them the For the Strength of Youth booklet and invite them to come and see how our young people strive to live by those principles If someone asks about your weekend don t hesitate to talk about what you experienced at church Tell about the little children who stood in front of a congregation and sang with eagerness how they are trying to be like Jesus Talk about the group of youth who spent time helping the elderly in rest homes to compile personal histories Talk about the recent change in our Sunday meeting schedule and how it blesses your family Or explain why we emphasize that this is the Church of Jesus Christ and that we are Latter day Saints just as the members of the ancient Church were also called Saints In whatever ways seem natural and normal to you share with people why Jesus Christ and His Church are important to you Invite them to come and see 16 Then encourage them to come and help There are numerous opportunities for people to help in our Church Pray not only for the missionaries to find the elect Pray daily with all your heart that you will find those who will come and see come and help and come and stay Keep the full time missionaries in the loop They are like angels ready to help As you share the good news the gospel of Jesus Christ do so with love and patience If we interact with people with the sole expectation that they soon will don a white jumpsuit and ask for directions to the nearest baptismal font we re doing it wrong Some who come and see will perhaps never join the Church some will at a later time That is their choice But that doesn t change our love for them And it doesn t change our enthusiastic efforts to continue inviting individuals and families to come and see come and help and come and stay Fifth trust the Lord to work His miracles Understand that it s not your job to convert people That is the role of the Holy Ghost Your role is to share what is in your heart and live consistent with your beliefs So don t be discouraged if someone does not accept the gospel message immediately It is not a personal failure That is between the individual and Heavenly Father Yours is to love God and love your neighbors His children Believe love do Follow this path and God will work miracles through you to bless His precious children These five suggestions will help you to do what disciples of Jesus Christ have done since ancient times His gospel and His Church are an important part of your life and of who you are and what you do Therefore invite others to come and see and come and help and God will do His saving work and they will come and stay But What If It s Hard But you might ask what if I do all this and people react poorly What if they are critical about the Church What if they unfriend me Yes that may happen Since ancient times disciples of Jesus Christ have often been persecuted 17 The Apostle Peter said Rejoice as you share Christ s sufferings 18 The early Saints rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name 19Remember the Lord works in mysterious ways It may be that by your Christlike response to rejection a hardened heart could be softened As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I bless you with the confidence to be a living testimonial of gospel values with the courage to always be recognized as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints with the humility to assist in His work as an expression of your love for Heavenly Father and His children My dear friends you will rejoice in knowing that you are a significant part in the long foretold gathering of Israel preparing for Christ s coming in power and great glory with all the holy angels 20Heavenly Father knows you The Lord loves you God will bless you This work is ordained of Him You can do this We can all do this together I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters it s such a wonderful occasion to be with you in this marvelous general conference session today to listen to inspired messages to listen to this marvelous amazing choir of missionaries representing the many thousands of missionaries all around the world our daughters our sons and especially to be united in our faith today again sustaining our dear President and prophet President Russell M Nelson the First Presidency and the General Officers of the Church What a joyful day to be with you today The ancient King Solomon was one of the most outwardly successful human beings in history 1 He seemed to have everything money power adoration honor But after decades of self indulgence and luxury how did King Solomon sum up his life All is vanity 2 he said This man who had it all ended up disillusioned pessimistic and unhappy despite everything he had going for him 3There is a word in German Weltschmerz Loosely defined it means a sadness that comes from brooding about how the world is inferior to how we think it ought to be Perhaps there is a little Weltschmerz in all of us When silent sorrows creep into the corners of our lives When sadness saturates our days and casts deep shadows over our nights When tragedy and injustice enter the world around us including in the lives of those we love When we journey through our own personal and lonely path of misfortune and pain darkens our stillness and breaches our tranquility we might be tempted to agree with Solomon that life is vain and devoid of meaning The Great HopeThe good news is there is hope There is a solution to the emptiness vanity and Weltschmerz of life There is a solution to even the deepest hopelessness and discouragement you might feel This hope is found in the transformative power of the gospel of Jesus Christ and in the Savior s redemptive power to heal us of our soul sickness I am come Jesus declared that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly 4We achieve that abundant life not by focusing on our own needs or on our own achievements but by becoming true disciples of Jesus Christ by following in His ways and engaging in His work We find the abundant life by forgetting ourselves and engaging in the great cause of Christ And what is the cause of Christ It is to believe in Him love as He loved and do as He did Jesus went about doing good 5 He walked among the poor the outcast the sick and the ashamed He ministered to the powerless the weak and the friendless He spent time with them He spoke with them And he healed them all 6Everywhere He went the Savior taught the good news 7 of the gospel He shared eternal truths that set people free spiritually as well as temporally Those who dedicate themselves to Christ s cause discover the truth of the Savior s promise Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it 8Solomon was wrong my dear brothers and sisters life is not vanity To the contrary it can be full of purpose meaning and peace The healing hands of Jesus Christ reach out to all who seek Him I have come to know without a doubt that believing and loving God and striving to follow Christ can change our hearts 9 soften our pain and fill our souls with exceedingly great joy 10Believe Love DoOf course we must do more than merely have an intellectual understanding of the gospel for it to have this healing influence in our lives We must incorporate it into our lives make it a part of who we are and what we do May I suggest that discipleship begins with three simple words Believe love and do Believing God leads to faith in Him and developing trust in His word Faith causes our hearts to grow in our love for God and others As that love grows we are inspired to emulate the Savior as we continue our own great journey on the path of discipleship But you say that seems a bit simplistic Life s problems certainly my problems are far too complex for such a simple prescription You can t cure Weltschmerz with three simple words Believe love do It is not the aphorism that cures It is the love of God that rescues restores and revives God knows you You are His child He loves you Even when you think that you are not lovable He reaches out to you This very day every day He reaches out to you desiring to heal you to lift you up and to replace the emptiness in your heart with an abiding joy He desires to sweep away any darkness that clouds your life and fill it with the sacred and brilliant light of His unending glory I have experienced this for myself And it is my witness as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ that all who come unto God all who truly believe love and do can experience the same We BelieveThe scriptures teach us that without faith it is impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is 11For some the act of believing is difficult Sometimes our pride gets in the way Perhaps we think that because we are intelligent educated or experienced we simply cannot believe in God And we begin to look at religion as foolish tradition 12In my experience belief is not so much like a painting we look at and admire and about which we discuss and theorize It is more like a plow that we take into the fields and by the sweat of our brow create furrows in the earth that accept seeds and bear fruit that shall remain 13Draw near to God and He will draw near to you 14 This is the promise to all who seek to believe We LoveThe scriptures reveal that the more we love God and His children the happier we become 15 The love Jesus spoke about however isn t a gift card throwaway move on to other things love It isn t a love that is spoken of and then forgotten It is not a let me know if there is anything I can do sort of love The love God speaks of is the kind that enters our hearts when we awake in the morning stays with us throughout the day and swells in our hearts as we give voice to our prayers of gratitude at evening s end This is the inexpressible love Heavenly Father has for us It is this endless compassion that allows us to more clearly see others for who they are Through the lens of pure love we see immortal beings of infinite potential and worth and beloved sons and daughters of Almighty God Once we see through that lens we cannot discount disregard or discriminate against anyone We DoIn the Savior s work it is often by small and simple means that great things are brought to pass 16We know that it requires repetitive practice to become good at anything Whether it s playing the clarinet kicking a ball into a net repairing a car or even flying an airplane it is through practicing that we may become better and better 17The organization our Savior created on earth The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints helps us to do just that It offers a place to practice living the way He taught and blessing others the way He did As Church members we are given callings responsibilities and opportunities to reach out in compassion and minister to others Recently the Church has placed a renewed emphasis on ministering or serving or loving others Great thought was taken to determine what we should call this special emphasis One of the names considered was shepherding a fitting reference to Christ s invitation Feed my sheep 18 However it had at least one complication using that term would make me a German shepherd Consequently I am quite content with the term ministering This Work Is for EveryoneOf course this emphasis is not new It simply provides a renewed and refined opportunity for us to practice the Savior s commandment to love one another 19 a refined way to implement and practice the purpose of the Church Just think about missionary work the courageous humble and confident sharing of the gospel is a wonderful example of ministering to the spiritual needs of others whoever they are Or doing temple work seeking out the names of our ancestors and offering them the blessings of eternity What a divine way of ministering Consider the act of seeking out the poor and the needy lifting the hands that hang down or blessing the sick and afflicted Aren t these the very acts of pure ministering the Lord practiced when He walked the earth If you are not a member of the Church I invite you to come and see 20 Come and join with us If you are a member of the Church but presently not participating actively I invite you please come back We need you Come add your strengths to ours Because of your unique talents abilities and personality you will help us become better and happier In return we will help you become better and happier as well Come help us build and strengthen a culture of healing kindness and mercy toward all of God s children For we are all striving to become new creatures where old things are passed away and all things become new 21 The Savior shows us the direction to move forward and upward He says If ye love me keep my commandments 22 Let us all work together to become the people God intended for us to become This is the kind of gospel culture we desire to cultivate throughout the Church of Jesus Christ We seek to strengthen the Church as a place where we forgive one another Where we resist the temptation to find fault gossip and bring others down Where instead of pointing out flaws we lift up and help each other to become the best we can be Let me invite you again Come and see Join with us We need you Imperfect PeopleYou will find that this Church is filled with some of the finest people this world has to offer They are welcoming loving kind and sincere They are hardworking willing to sacrifice and even heroic at times And they are also painfully imperfect They make mistakes From time to time they say things they shouldn t They do things they wish they hadn t But they do have this in common they want to improve and draw closer to the Lord our Savior even Jesus Christ They are trying to get it right They believe They love They do They want to become less selfish more compassionate more refined more like Jesus The Blueprint for HappinessYes life can be hard at times Certainly we all have our times of despair and discouragement But the gospel of Jesus Christ offers hope And in the Church of Jesus Christ we join with others who seek a place where we can feel at home a place of growth where together we can believe love and do Regardless of our differences we seek to embrace one another as sons and daughters of our beloved Heavenly Father I am grateful beyond measure to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and to know that God loves His children enough to give them a blueprint for happiness and meaning in this life and a way to experience eternal joy in the halls of glory in the life to come I am grateful that God has given us a way to heal the soul sicknesses and the Weltschmerz of life I testify and leave you my blessing that as we believe in God as we love Him and love His children with all our hearts and as we strive to do as God has instructed us we will find healing and peace happiness and meaning In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters dear friends I am grateful to be with you on this wonderful general conference weekend Harriet and I rejoice with you in sustaining Elders Gong and Soares and the many brothers and sisters who have received significant new callings during this general conference Although I miss my dear friend President Thomas S Monson I love sustain and support our prophet and President Russell M Nelson and his noble counselors I am also thankful and honored to once again work more closely with my beloved fellow Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Most of all I am deeply humbled and very happy to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints where millions of men women and children are willing to lift where they stand in whatever capacity or calling and strive with all their hearts to serve God and His children building the kingdom of God Today is a sacred day It is Easter Sunday when we commemorate that glorious morning when our Savior broke the bands of death1 and emerged triumphant from the tomb The Greatest Day in HistoryRecently I asked the internet What day most changed the course of history The responses ranged from surprising and strange to insightful and thought provoking Among them the day when a prehistoric asteroid struck the Yucat n Peninsula or when in 1440 Johannes Gutenberg finished his printing press and of course the day in 1903 when the Wright brothers showed the world that man really can fly If the same question were asked of you what would you say In my mind the answer is clear To find the most important day in history we must go back to that evening almost 2 000 years ago in the Garden of Gethsemane when Jesus Christ knelt in intense prayer and offered Himself as a ransom for our sins It was during this great and infinite sacrifice of unparalleled suffering in both body and spirit that Jesus Christ even God bled at every pore Out of perfect love He gave all that we might receive all His supernal sacrifice difficult to comprehend to be felt only with all our heart and mind reminds us of the universal debt of gratitude we owe Christ for His divine gift Later that night Jesus was brought before religious and political authorities who mocked Him beat Him and sentenced Him to a shameful death He hung in agony upon the cross until finally it was finished 2 His lifeless body was laid in a borrowed tomb And then on the morning of the third day Jesus Christ the Son of Almighty God emerged from the tomb as a glorious resurrected being of splendor light and majesty Yes there are many events throughout history that have profoundly affected the destiny of nations and peoples But combine them all and they cannot begin to compare to the importance of what happened on that first Easter morning What is it that makes the infinite sacrifice and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ the most important event in history more influential than world wars cataclysmic disasters and life changing scientific discoveries Because of Jesus Christ We Can Live AgainThe answer lies in two great insurmountable challenges that every one of us faces First we all die No matter how young beautiful healthy or cautious you are someday your body will become lifeless Friends and family will mourn you But they cannot bring you back Nevertheless because of Jesus Christ your death will be temporary Your spirit one day will reunite with your body This resurrected body will not be subject to death 3 and you will live in the eternities free from pain and physical suffering 4This will happen because of Jesus the Christ who laid down His life and took it up again He did this for all who believe in Him He did this for all who do not believe in Him He did this even for those who mock revile and curse His name 5Because of Jesus Christ We Can Live with GodSecond we have all sinned Our sins would forever keep us from living with God because no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom 6As a result every man woman and child was shut out of His presence that is until Jesus Christ the Lamb without spot offered His life as a ransom for our sins Because Jesus owed no debt to justice He could pay our debt and meet the demands of justice for every soul And that includes you and me Jesus Christ paid the price for our sins All of them On that most important day in history Jesus the Christ opened the gates of death and cast aside the barriers that prevented us from passing into the holy and hallowed halls of everlasting life Because of our Lord and Savior you and I are granted a most precious and priceless gift regardless of our past we can repent and follow the path that leads to celestial light and glory surrounded by the faithful children of Heavenly Father Why We RejoiceThis is what we celebrate on Easter Sunday we celebrate life Because of Jesus Christ we will rise from the despair of death and embrace those we love shedding tears of overwhelming joy and overflowing gratitude Because of Jesus Christ we will exist as eternal beings worlds without end Because of Jesus the Christ our sins can not only be erased they can be forgotten We can become purified and exalted Holy Because of our beloved Savior we can forever drink from the fountain of water that springs up into eternal life 7 We can dwell forever in the mansions of our eternal King in unimaginable glory and perfect happiness Do We Behold the Man In spite of all this there are many in the world today who are either not aware of or do not believe in the precious gift Jesus Christ has given us They may have heard of Jesus Christ and know of Him as a historical figure but they do not see Him for who He truly is When I think of this I am reminded of the Savior standing before the Roman prefect of Judea Pontius Pilate just a few hours before the Savior s death Pilate viewed Jesus from a strictly worldly perspective Pilate had a job to do and it involved two major tasks collecting taxes for Rome and keeping the peace Now the Jewish Sanhedrin had brought before him a man who they claimed was an obstacle to both 8After interrogating his prisoner Pilate announced I find in him no fault at all 9 But he felt he had to appease Jesus s accusers so Pilate called upon a local custom that allowed one prisoner to be released during Passover season Would they not have him release Jesus instead of the notorious robber and murderer Barabbas 10But the tumultuous mob demanded that Pilate release Barabbas and crucify Jesus Why Pilate asked What evil has he done But they only shouted the louder Crucify him 11In one final effort to satisfy the mob Pilate ordered his men to scourge Jesus 12 This they did leaving Him bloodied and bruised They mocked Him placed a crown of thorns on His head and clothed Him in a purple robe 13Perhaps Pilate thought this would satisfy the mob s lust for blood Perhaps they would take pity on the man Behold I bring him forth to you Pilate said that ye may know that I find no fault in him Behold the man 14The Son of God stood in the flesh before the people of Jerusalem They could see Jesus but they did not truly behold Him They did not have eyes to see 15In a figurative sense we too are invited to behold the man Opinions about Him vary in the world Ancient and modern prophets testify that He is the Son of God I do this too It is significant and important that we each come to know for ourselves So when you ponder the life and ministry of Jesus Christ what do you see Those who find a way to truly behold the Man find the doorway to life s greatest joys and the balm to life s most demanding despairs So when you are encompassed by sorrows and grief behold the Man When you feel lost or forgotten behold the Man When you are despairing deserted doubting damaged or defeated behold the Man He will comfort you He will heal you and give meaning to your journey He will pour out His Spirit and fill your heart with exceeding joy 16He gives power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength 17When we truly behold the Man we learn of Him and seek to align our lives with Him We repent and strive to refine our natures and daily grow a little closer to Him We trust Him We show our love for Him by keeping His commandments and by living up to our sacred covenants In other words we become His disciples His refining light saturates our souls His grace uplifts us Our burdens are lightened our peace deepened When we truly behold the Man we have the promise of a blessed future that inspires and upholds us through the bends and bumps in life s journey Looking back we will recognize that there is a divine pattern that the dots really connect 18As you accept His sacrifice become His disciple and finally reach the end of your earthly journey what will become of the sorrows you have endured in this life They will be gone The disappointments betrayals persecutions you have faced Gone The suffering heartache guilt shame and anguish you have passed through Gone Forgotten Is it any wonder that we talk of Christ we rejoice in Christ we preach of Christ we prophesy of Christ that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins 19Is it any wonder that we strive with all our hearts to truly behold the Man My beloved brothers and sisters I testify that the most important day in the history of mankind was the day when Jesus Christ the living Son of God won the victory over death and sin for all of God s children And the most important day in your life and mine is the day when we learn to behold the man when we see Him for who He truly is when we partake with all our heart and mind of His atoning power when with renewed enthusiasm and strength we commit to follow Him May that be a day that recurs over and over again throughout our lives I leave you my testimony and blessing that as we behold the man we will find meaning joy and peace in this earthly life and eternal life in the world to come In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Recently as we met with President Thomas S Monson he expressed with great solemnity and a countenance of happiness how much he loves the Lord and that he knows that the Lord loves him My dear brothers and sisters I know that President Monson is very grateful for your love your prayers and your dedication to the Lord and His great gospel Bobbie the Wonder DogNearly a century ago a family from Oregon was vacationing in Indiana over 2 000 miles 3 200 km away when they lost their beloved dog Bobbie The frantic family searched for the dog everywhere but to no avail Bobbie could not be found Heartbroken they made the trip home each mile taking them farther away from their cherished pet Six months later the family was stunned to find Bobbie on their doorstep in Oregon Mangy scrawny feet worn to the bone he appeared to have walked the entire distance by himself 1 Bobbie s story captured the imagination of people across the United States and he became known as Bobbie the Wonder Dog Bobbie is not the only animal who has baffled scientists with an amazing sense of direction and instinct for home Some monarch butterfly populations migrate 3 000 miles 4 800 km each year to climes better suited for their survival Leatherback turtles travel across the Pacific Ocean from Indonesia to the coasts of California Humpback whales swim from the cold waters of the North and South Poles toward the equator and back Perhaps even more incredibly the arctic tern flies from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica and back every year some 60 000 miles 97 000 km When scientists study this fascinating behavior they ask questions such as How do they know where to go and How does each successive generation learn this behavior When I read of this powerful instinct in animals I can t help but wonder Is it possible that human beings have a similar yearning an inner guidance system if you will that draws them to their heavenly home I believe that every man woman and child has felt the call of heaven at some point in his or her life Deep within us is a longing to somehow reach past the veil and embrace Heavenly Parents we once knew and cherished Some might suppress this yearning and deaden their souls to its call But those who do not quench this light within themselves can embark on an incredible journey a wondrous migration toward heavenly climes God Calls to YouThe sublime message of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is that God is our Father that He cares about us and that there is a way to return to Him God calls to you God knows your every thought your sorrows and your greatest hopes God knows the many times you have sought Him The many times you have felt limitless joy The many times you have wept in loneliness The many times you have felt helpless confused or angry Yet no matter your history if you have faltered failed feel broken bitter betrayed or beaten know that you are not alone God still calls to you The Savior extends His hand to you And as He did to those fishermen who stood long ago on the banks of the Sea of Galilee with infinite love He speaks to you Come follow me 2If you will hear Him He will speak to you this very day When you walk the path of discipleship when you move toward Heavenly Father there is something within you that will confirm that you have heard the call of the Savior and set your heart toward the light It will tell you that you are on the right path and that you are returning home Since the beginning of time God s prophets have urged the people of their day to hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God keep his commandments and his statutes and turn unto Him with all thine heart and with all thy soul 3The scriptures teach us a thousand reasons why we should do this Today let me offer two reasons why we should turn to the Lord First your life will be better Second God will use you to make the lives of others better Your Life Will Be BetterI testify that when we embark upon or continue the incredible journey that leads to God our lives will be better This does not mean that our lives will be free from sorrow We all know of faithful followers of Christ who suffer tragedy and injustice Jesus Christ Himself suffered more than anyone Just as God makes the sun to rise on the evil and on the good He also allows adversity to test the just and the unjust 4 In fact sometimes it seems that our lives are more difficult because we are trying to live our faith No following the Savior will not remove all of your trials However it will remove the barriers between you and the help your Heavenly Father wants to give you God will be with you He will direct your steps He will walk beside you and even carry you when your need is greatest You will experience the sublime fruit of the Spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness and faith 5These spiritual fruits are not a product of temporal prosperity success or good fortune They come from following the Savior and they can be our faithful attendants even in the midst of the darkest storms The fires and tumults of mortal life may threaten and frighten but those who incline their hearts to God will be encircled by His peace Their joy will not be diminished They will not be abandoned or forgotten Trust in the Lord with all thine heart the scriptures teach and lean not unto thine own understanding In all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths 6Those who heed the inner call and seek God those who pray believe and walk the path the Savior has prepared even if they stumble along the path at times receive the consoling assurance that all things shall work together for their good 7For God gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak 8 For though the righteous fall seven times they rise again 9And the Lord in His goodness asks Do you want to experience abiding joy Do you yearn to feel within your heart the peace that passes understanding 10Then turn your soul toward the light Begin your own wonderful journey home As you do so your life will be better happier and more purposeful God Will Use YouOn your journey back to Heavenly Father you will soon realize that this journey isn t just about focusing on your own life No this path inevitably leads you to become a blessing in the lives of God s other children your brothers and sisters And the interesting thing about the journey is that as you serve God and as you care for and help your fellowmen you will see great progress in your own life in ways you could never imagine Perhaps you don t consider yourself all that useful perhaps you don t consider yourself a blessing in somebody s life Often when we look at ourselves we see only our limitations and deficiencies We might think we have to be more of something for God to use us more intelligent more wealthy more charismatic more talented more spiritual Blessings will come not so much because of your abilities but because of your choices And the God of the universe will work within and through you magnifying your humble efforts for His purposes His work has always advanced on this important principle Out of small things proceedeth that which is great 11When writing to the Saints in Corinth the Apostle Paul observed that not many of them would be considered wise by worldly standards But that didn t matter because God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty 12The history of God s work is filled with people who considered themselves inadequate But they humbly served relying on the grace of God and His promise Their arm shall be my arm and I will be their shield and they shall fight manfully for me and I will preserve them 13This past summer our family had a wonderful opportunity to visit some early Church history sites in the eastern United States In a special way we relived the history of that time People I had read so much about people like Martin Harris Oliver Cowdery and Thomas B Marsh became more real to me as we walked where they walked and pondered the sacrifices they made to build the kingdom of God They had many great traits that allowed them to make significant contributions to the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ But they were also human weak and fallible just as you and I are Some found themselves at variance with the Prophet Joseph Smith and fell away from the Church Later many of the same people had a change of heart humbled themselves and once again sought and found fellowship with the Saints We might have a tendency to judge these brethren and other members like them We might say I would never have abandoned the Prophet Joseph While that may be true we don t really know what it was like to live in that time in those circumstances No they were not perfect but how encouraging it is to know that God was able to use them anyway He knew their strengths and weaknesses and He gave them the extraordinary opportunity to contribute a verse or a melody to the glorious anthem of the Restoration How encouraging it is to know though we are imperfect if our hearts are turned to God He will be generous and kind and use us for His purposes Those who love and serve God and fellowmen and humbly and actively participate in His work will see wondrous things happen in their lives and in the lives of those they love Doors that seemed shut will open Angels will go before them and prepare the way No matter your position in your community or in the Church God will use you if you are willing He will magnify your righteous desires and turn the compassionate actions you sow into a bountiful harvest of goodness We Can t Get There on AutopilotWe are each one of us strangers and pilgrims 14 in this world In many ways we are far from home But that doesn t mean we need to feel lost or alone Our beloved Father in Heaven has given us the Light of Christ And deep within each one of us a heavenly stirring urges us to turn our eyes and hearts to Him as we make the pilgrimage back to our celestial home This requires effort You cannot get there without striving to learn of Him understanding His instructions earnestly applying them and putting one foot in front of the other No life is not a self driving car It is not an airplane on autopilot You cannot just float in the waters of life and trust that the current will take you wherever you hope to be one day Discipleship requires our willingness to swim upstream when needed No one else is responsible for your personal journey The Savior will help you and prepare the way before you but the commitment to follow Him and keep His commandments must come from you That is your sole burden your sole privilege This is your great adventure Please heed the call of your Savior Follow Him The Lord has established The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints to help you in this commitment to serve God and fellowmen Its purpose is to encourage teach lift and inspire This wonderful Church provides opportunities for you to exercise compassion reach out to others and renew and keep sacred covenants It is designed to bless your life and improve your home community and nation Come join with us and trust the Lord Lend your talents to His wonderful work Reach out encourage heal and support all who desire to feel and heed the yearning for our supernal home Let us join together in this glorious pilgrimage to heavenly climes The gospel is a transcendent message of hope happiness and joy It is the pathway that leads us home As we embrace the gospel in faith and deed each day and every hour we will draw a little closer to our God Our lives will be better and the Lord will use us in remarkable ways to bless those around us and bring about His eternal purposes Of this I testify and leave you my blessing in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear sisters dear friends to begin general conference with a worldwide sisters session is significant and wonderful Just imagine sisters of all ages backgrounds nationalities and languages united in faith and love for the Lord Jesus Christ As we recently met with our beloved prophet President Thomas S Monson he expressed to us how much he loves the Lord And I know that President Monson is very grateful for your love your prayers and your devotion to the Lord A long time ago in a distant land lived a family of three sisters The first sister was sad Everything from her nose to her chin and from her skin to her toes seemed not quite good enough to her When she spoke her words sometimes came out awkwardly and people laughed When someone criticized her or forgot to invite her to something she would blush walk away and find a secret spot where she would let out a sad sigh and wonder why life had turned out to be so bleak and cheerless The second sister was mad She thought of herself as very smart but there was always someone else who scored higher on tests at school She considered herself funny fair fashionable and fascinating But always there seemed to be someone who was funnier fairer more fashionable or more fascinating She was never first at anything and this she could not endure Life was not supposed to be this way Sometimes she lashed out at others and it seemed that she was always one breath away from being outraged by one thing or another Of course this did not make her any more likable or popular Sometimes she clenched her teeth tightened her fists and thought Life is so unfair Then there was the third sister Unlike her sad and mad sisters she was well glad And it wasn t because she was smarter or more beautiful or more capable than her sisters No people sometimes avoided or ignored her too They sometimes made fun of what she was wearing or the things she was saying They sometimes said mean things about her But she did not allow any of that to bother her too much This sister loved to sing She didn t have great pitch and people laughed about it but that didn t stop her She would say I am not going to let other people and their opinions stop me from singing The very fact that she kept singing made her first sister sad and her second sister mad Many years passed and eventually each sister reached the end of her time on earth The first sister who discovered again and again that there was no shortage of disappointments in life eventually died sad The second who every day found something new to dislike died mad And the third sister who spent her life singing her song with all her might and a confident smile on her face died glad Of course life is never so simple and people are never so one dimensional as the three sisters in this story But even extreme examples like these can teach us something about ourselves If you are like most of us you may have recognized part of yourself in one two or perhaps all three of these sisters Let us take a closer look at each one The VictimThe first sister saw herself as a victim as someone who was acted upon 1 It seemed like one thing after another kept happening to her that made her miserable With this approach to life she was giving others control over how she felt and behaved When we do this we are driven about by every wind of opinion and in this day of ever present social media those winds blow at hurricane intensity Dear sisters why should you surrender your happiness to someone or a group of someones who cares very little about you or your happiness If you find yourself worrying about what other people say about you may I suggest this antidote remember who you are Remember that you are of the royal house of the kingdom of God daughters of Heavenly Parents who reign throughout the universe You have the spiritual DNA of God You have unique gifts that originated in your spiritual creation and that were developed during the vast span of your premortal life You are the child of our merciful and everlasting Father in Heaven the Lord of Hosts the One who created the universe spread the spinning stars across the vast expanse of space and placed the planets in their appointed orbits You are in His hands Very good hands Loving hands Caring hands And nothing anyone ever says about you can change that Their words are meaningless compared to what God has said about you You are His precious child He loves you Even when you stumble even when you turn away from Him God loves you If you are feeling lost abandoned or forgotten fear not The Good Shepherd will find you He will lift you upon His shoulders And He will carry you home 2My dear sisters please let these divine truths sink deeply into your hearts And you will find that there are many reasons not to be sad for you have an eternal destiny to fulfill The beloved Savior of the world gave His life so that you could choose to make that destiny a reality You have taken upon you His name you are His disciples And because of Him you can clothe yourselves with robes of eternal glory The HaterThe second sister was angry at the world Like her sad sister she felt that the problems in her life were all caused by someone else She blamed her family her friends her boss and coworkers the police the neighbors Church leaders current fashion trends even the intensity of solar flares and plain bad luck And she lashed out at all of them She didn t think of herself as a mean person To the contrary she felt that she was only sticking up for herself Everyone else she believed was motivated by selfishness pettiness and hate She on the other hand was motivated by good intentions justice integrity and love Unfortunately the mad sister s line of thinking is all too common This was noted in a recent study that explored conflict between rival groups As part of the study researchers interviewed Palestinians and Israelis in the Middle East and Republicans and Democrats in the United States They discovered that each side felt their own group was motivated by love more than hate but when asked why their rival group was involved in the conflict they pointed to hate as the other group s motivating factor 3In other words each group thought of themselves as the good guys fair kind and truthful By contrast they saw their rivals as the bad guys uninformed dishonest even evil In the year I was born the world was immersed in a terrible war that brought agonizing grief and consuming sorrow to the world This war was caused by my own nation by a group of people who identified certain other groups as evil and encouraged hatred toward them They silenced those they did not like They shamed and demonized them They considered them inferior even less than human Once you degrade a group of people you are more likely to justify words and acts of violence against them I shudder when I think about what happened in 20th century Germany When someone opposes or disagrees with us it s tempting to assume that there must be something wrong with them And from there it s a small step to attach the worst of motives to their words and actions Of course we must always stand for what is right and there are times when we must raise our voices for that cause However when we do so with anger or hate in our hearts when we lash out at others to hurt shame or silence them chances are we are not doing so in righteousness What did the Savior teach I say unto you Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven 4This is the Savior s way It is the first step in breaking down the barriers that create so much anger hatred division and violence in the world Yes you might say I would be willing to love my enemies if only they were willing to do the same But that doesn t really matter does it We are responsible for our own discipleship and it has little if anything to do with the way others treat us We obviously hope that they will be understanding and charitable in return but our love for them is independent of their feelings toward us Perhaps our effort to love our enemies will soften their hearts and influence them for good Perhaps it will not But that does not change our commitment to follow Jesus Christ So as members of the Church of Jesus Christ we will love our enemies We will overcome anger or hate We will fill our hearts with love for all of God s children We will reach out to bless others and minister to them even those who might despitefully use us and persecute us 5The Authentic DiscipleThe third sister represents the authentic disciple of Jesus Christ She did something that can be extremely hard to do she trusted God even in the face of ridicule and hardship Somehow she maintained her faith and hope despite the scorn and cynicism around her She lived joyfully not because her circumstances were joyful but because she was joyful None of us makes it through life s journey unopposed With so many forces trying to draw us away how do we keep our vision fixed on the glorious happiness promised to the faithful I believe the answer can be found in a dream that a prophet had thousands of years ago The prophet s name is Lehi and his dream is recorded in the precious and wonderful Book of Mormon In his dream Lehi saw a vast field and in it was a wondrous tree beautiful beyond description He also saw large groups of people making their way toward the tree They wanted to taste its glorious fruit They felt and trusted that it would give them great happiness and abiding peace There was a narrow path that led to the tree and alongside was an iron rod that helped them stay on the path But there was also a mist of darkness that obscured their vision of both the path and the tree And perhaps even more dangerous was the sound of loud laughter and ridicule coming from a large and spacious building nearby Shockingly the mocking even convinced some people who had reached the tree and tasted the wondrous fruit to begin to feel ashamed and wander away 6Perhaps they began to doubt that the tree was really as beautiful as they had once thought Perhaps they began to question the reality of what they had experienced Maybe they thought if they turned away from the tree life would be easier Maybe they would not be ridiculed or laughed at anymore And actually the people who were scoffing at them looked like people who were quite happy and having a good time So perhaps if they abandoned the tree they would be welcomed into the congregation of the great and spacious building and be applauded for their judgment intelligence and sophistication Stay on the PathDear sisters dear friends if you find it difficult to hold fast to the iron rod and walk steadfastly toward salvation if the laughter and ridicule of others who seem so confident cause you to waver if you are troubled by unanswered questions or doctrines you don t understand yet if you feel saddened because of disappointments I urge you to remember Lehi s dream Stay on the path Never let go of the rod of iron the word of God And when anyone tries to make you ashamed for partaking of the love of God ignore them Never forget you are a child of God rich blessings are in store if you can learn to do His will you ll live with Him once more 7The promises of praise and acceptance by the world are unreliable untrue and unsatisfying God s promises are sure true and joyful now and forever I invite you to consider religion and faith from a higher perspective Nothing offered in the great and spacious building can compare with the fruit of living the gospel of Jesus Christ Indeed eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 8I have learned for myself that the path of discipleship in the gospel of Jesus Christ is the way to joy It is the way to safety and peace It is the way to truth I testify that by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost you can learn this for yourself In the meantime if the path becomes difficult for you I hope you will find refuge and strength in our wonderful organizations of the Church Primary Young Women and Relief Society They are like waypoints on the path where you can renew your confidence and faith for the journey ahead They are a safe home where you can feel a sense of belonging and receive encouragement from your sisters and fellow disciples The things you learn in Primary prepare you for the additional truths you learn as young women The path of discipleship you walk in your Young Women classes leads to the fellowship and sisterhood of Relief Society With each step along the way you are given additional opportunities to demonstrate your love for others through acts of faith compassion charity virtue and service Choosing this path of discipleship will lead to untold happiness and fulfillment of your divine nature It will not be easy It will require the very best that you have all your intelligence creativity faith integrity strength determination and love But one day you will look back upon your efforts and oh how grateful you will be that you remained strong that you believed and that you did not depart from the path Press OnThere may be many things about life that are beyond your control But in the end you have the power to choose both your destination and many of your experiences along the way It is not so much your abilities but your choices that make the difference in life 9You cannot allow circumstances to make you sad You cannot allow them to make you mad You can rejoice that you are a daughter of God You can find joy and happiness in the grace of God and in the love of Jesus Christ You can be glad I urge you to fill your hearts with gratitude for the abundant and limitless goodness of God My beloved sisters you can do this I pray with all the affection of my soul that you will make the choice to press on toward the tree of life I pray that you will choose to lift up your voice and make your life a glorious symphony of praise rejoicing in what the love of God the wonders of His Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ can bring to the world The song of true discipleship may sound off key or even a little loud to some Since the beginning of time this has been so But to our Heavenly Father and to those who love and honor Him it is a most precious and beautiful song the sublime and sanctifying song of redeeming love and service to God and fellowmen 10I leave you my blessing as an Apostle of the Lord that you will find the strength and courage to joyfully thrive as a daughter of God while gladly walking each day on the glorious path of discipleship In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
An elderly man was standing in line at the post office to buy stamps at the service counter A young woman noticed that he walked with difficulty and offered to show him how to buy stamps from a machine to save time The elderly gentleman said Thank you but I prefer waiting The machine won t ask me about my arthritis Sometimes it helps to talk to someone who cares about our troubles Pain sorrow and illness are experiences we all share the moments of mishap misery and misfortune can add up to a sizable memory on our soul s own internal hard drive When it comes to our physical well being we accept aging and illness as part of our mortal journey We seek the counsel of professionals who understand the physical body When we suffer from emotional distress or mental illness we seek the help of experts who treat these kinds of ailments Just as we face physical and emotional trials in this mortality we also face spiritual challenges Most of us have experienced times in our lives when our testimony burns brightly We also may have experienced times when our Heavenly Father seems distant There are times when we treasure the things of the Spirit with all our hearts There may also be times when they appear less precious or of diminished significance Today I wish to speak of spiritual wellness how we can find healing from stagnation and walk a path of vibrant spiritual health Spiritual SicknessSometimes spiritual illness comes as a result of sin or emotional wounds Sometimes spiritual breakdowns come so gradually that we can scarcely tell what is happening Like layers of sedimentary rock spiritual pain and grief can build over time weighing upon our spirits until it is almost too heavy to bear For example this can happen when our responsibilities at work home and church become so overwhelming that we lose sight of the joy of the gospel We might even feel as though we have no more to give or that living the commandments of God is beyond our strength But just because spiritual trials are real does not mean that they are incurable We can heal spiritually Even the deepest spiritual wounds yes even those that may appear to be incurable can be healed My dear friends the healing power of Jesus Christ is not absent in our day The Savior s healing touch can transform lives in our day just as it did in His If we will but have faith He can take our hands fill our souls with heavenly light and healing and speak to us the blessed words Rise take up thy bed and walk 1Darkness and LightWhatever causes our spiritual ailments they all have one thing in common the absence of divine light Darkness reduces our ability to see clearly It dims our vision of that which was at one time plain and clear When we are in darkness we are more likely to make poor choices because we cannot see dangers in our path When we are in darkness we are more likely to lose hope because we cannot see the peace and joy that await us if we just keep pressing forward Light on the other hand allows us to see things as they really are It allows us to discern between truth and error between the vital and the trivial When we are in the light we can make righteous choices based on true principles When we are in the light we have a perfect brightness of hope 2 because we can see our mortal trials from an eternal perspective We will find spiritual healing as we step away from the shadows of the world and into the everlasting Light of Christ The more we understand and apply the doctrinal concept of light the more we can guard against spiritual sicknesses that afflict or trouble us on every side and hand and the better we can serve as energetic courageous caring and humble bearers of the holy priesthood true servants and disciples of our beloved and eternal King The Light of the WorldJesus Christ said I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness but shall have the light of life 3What does this mean Simply this He who humbly follows Jesus Christ will experience and share in His light And that light will grow until it eventually dispels even the most profound darkness It means that there is a power a strong influence that emanates from the Savior It proceeds forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space 4 Because this power enlightens uplifts and illuminates our lives the scriptures often call it light but it is also referred to as spirit and truth In the Doctrine and Covenants we read The word of the Lord is truth and whatsoever is truth is light and whatsoever is light is Spirit even the Spirit of Jesus Christ 5This profound insight that light is spirit which is truth and that this light shines upon every soul who comes into the world is as important as it is hopeful The Light of Christ enlightens and saturates the souls of all who hearken to the voice of the Spirit 6The Light of Christ fills the universe It fills the earth And it can fill every heart God is no respecter of persons 7 His light is available to all great or small rich or poor privileged or disadvantaged If you open your mind and heart to receive the Light of Christ and humbly follow the Savior you will receive more light Line upon line here a little and there a little you will gather more light and truth into your souls until darkness has been banished from your life 8God will open your eyes God will give you a new heart God s love light and truth will cause dormant things to spring to life and you will be reborn into a newness of life in Christ Jesus 9The Lord has promised If your eye be single to my glory your whole bodies shall be filled with light and there shall be no darkness in you and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things 10This is the ultimate remedy for spiritual sickness Darkness vanishes in the presence of light A Metaphor for Spiritual DarknessHowever God will not force us to embrace His light If we become comfortable with darkness it is unlikely that our hearts will change For change to take place we need to actively let the light in During my flights as an airline captain across our planet earth I was always fascinated by the beauty and perfection of God s creation I found especially captivating the relationship between the earth and the sun I consider it a profound object lesson of how darkness and light exist As we all know within every 24 hours night turns to day and day turns to night So then what is night Night is nothing more than a shadow Even in the darkest of nights the sun does not cease to radiate its light It continues to shine as bright as ever But half of the earth is in darkness The absence of light causes darkness When the darkness of night falls we do not despair and worry that the sun is extinguished We do not postulate that the sun is not there or is dead We understand that we are in a shadow that the earth will continue to rotate and that eventually the rays of the sun will reach us once again Darkness is not an indication that there is no light Most often it simply means we re not in the right place to receive the light During the recent solar eclipse many made great efforts to get into the narrow band of a shadow created by the moon in the middle of a bright sunny day In a very similar way spiritual light continually shines upon all of God s creation Satan will make every effort to create a shadow or get us into a shadow of our own making He will coerce us to create our own eclipse he will push us into the darkness of his cavern Spiritual darkness can draw a veil of forgetfulness around even those who once walked in the light and rejoiced in the Lord Nevertheless even in moments of greatest darkness God hears our humble petitions as we pray Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief 11In the days of Alma there were many who struggled to accept spiritual things and because of their unbelief God s light and truth could not enter their souls and their hearts were hardened 12We Are Bearers of LightBrethren it is up to us to be in the right place to see the divine light and truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ Even when night has fallen and the world seems dark we can choose to walk in Christ s light keep His commandments and courageously testify of His reality and His greatness As a bearer of God s priesthood and as a disciple of Jesus Christ you are a bearer of light Keep doing the things that will nurture His divine light Hold up your light 13 and let it shine before men not so that they will see and admire you but that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven 14My dear brothers you are instruments in the hands of the Lord with the purpose of bringing light and healing to the souls of Heavenly Father s children Perhaps you do not feel qualified to heal those who are spiritually ill certainly not any more than a post office employee is qualified to help with arthritis Maybe you face spiritual challenges of your own Nevertheless the Lord has called you He has given you authority and responsibility to reach out to those in need He has endowed you with His sacred priesthood power to bring light into the darkness and uplift and bless God s children God has restored His Church and His precious gospel which healeth the wounded soul 15 He has prepared the path to spiritual wellness to find healing from stagnation and move toward vibrant spiritual health Every time you turn your hearts to God in humble prayer you experience His light Every time you seek His word and will in the scriptures the light grows in brightness Every time you notice someone in need and sacrifice your own comfort to reach out in love the light expands and swells Every time you reject temptation and choose purity every time you seek or extend forgiveness every time you courageously testify of truth the light chases away darkness and attracts others who are also seeking light and truth Think about your own personal experiences moments of service to God and fellowmen when divine light has shined in your life in the holy temple at the sacrament table in a quiet moment of prayerful pondering in your family gatherings or during an act of priesthood service Share those moments with family friends and especially with our youth who are seeking light They need to hear from you that with this light come hope and healing even in a world full of darkness Christ s light brings hope happiness and healing of any spiritual wound or ailment 16 Those who experience this refining influence become instruments in the hands of the Light of the World to give light to others 17 They will feel what King Lamoni felt This light had infused such joy into his soul the cloud of darkness having been dispelled and the light of everlasting life was lit up in his soul 18My dear brethren my dear friends it is our quest to seek the Lord until His light of everlasting life burns brightly within us and our testimony becomes confident and strong even in the midst of darkness It is my prayer and blessing that you will succeed in fulfilling your destiny as priesthood holders of Almighty God and always be joyful bearers of His heavenly light In the sacred name of Jesus Christ our Master amen

My dear brothers dear friends how grateful I am to be with you in this inspiring worldwide priesthood meeting President Monson thank you for your message and blessing We will always take to heart your words of direction counsel and wisdom We love and sustain you and we always pray for you You are indeed the Lord s prophet You are our President We sustain we love you Almost two decades ago the Madrid Spain Temple was dedicated and began its service as a sacred house of the Lord Harriet and I remember it well because I was serving in the Europe Area Presidency at the time Along with many others we spent countless hours attending to the details of planning and organizing the events leading up to the dedication As the date of the dedication approached I noticed that I had not yet received an invitation to attend This was a bit unexpected After all in my responsibility as the Area President I had been greatly involved in this temple project and felt a small amount of ownership for it I asked Harriet if she had seen an invitation She had not Days passed and my anxiety increased I wondered if our invitation had gotten lost perhaps it was buried between the cushions of our sofa Maybe it had been mixed up with junk mail and thrown away The neighbors had an inquisitive cat and I even began to look suspiciously at him Finally I was forced to accept the fact I had not been invited But how was that possible Had I done something to offend Did someone just assume it was too far for us to travel Had I been forgotten Eventually I realized that this line of thinking led to a place in which I did not wish to take up residence Harriet and I reminded ourselves that the temple dedication was not about us It wasn t about who deserved to be invited or who did not And it wasn t about our feelings or our sense of entitlement It was about dedicating a holy edifice a temple of the Most High God It was a day of rejoicing for the members of the Church in Spain Had I been invited to attend I would have done so gladly But if I were not invited my joy would not be any less profound Harriet and I would rejoice with our friends our beloved brothers and sisters from afar We would praise God for this wonderful blessing just as enthusiastically from our home in Frankfurt as we would from Madrid Sons of ThunderAmong the Twelve whom Jesus called and ordained were two brothers James and John Do you remember the nickname He gave them Sons of Thunder Boanerges 1You don t get a nickname like that without an intriguing backstory Unfortunately the scriptures don t provide much explanation about the nickname s origin However we do get brief glimpses into the character of James and John These were the same brothers who suggested calling down fire from heaven on a village in Samaria over not being invited into town 2James and John were fishermen probably a little rough around the edges but I guess they knew a lot about the elements of nature Certainly they were men of action On one occasion as the Savior prepared to make His final journey to Jerusalem James and John approached Him with a special request one perhaps worthy of their nickname We want you to do for us whatever we ask they said I can imagine Jesus smiling at them as He responded What do you want Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory The Savior now challenged them to think a little more deeply about what they were asking and said To sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared 3In other words you can t get honor in the kingdom of heaven by campaigning for it Nor can you power lunch your way to eternal glory When the other ten Apostles heard about this request from the Sons of Thunder they weren t especially happy Jesus knew His time was short and seeing contention among those who would carry on His work must have troubled Him He talked to the Twelve about the nature of power and how it affects those who seek and hold it The people of influence in the world He said use their position of authority to exercise power over others I can almost see the Savior looking with infinite love into the faces of those faithful and believing disciples I can almost hear His pleading voice This is not the way it shall be among you Instead whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister And whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all 4In God s kingdom greatness and leadership means seeing others as they truly are as God sees them and then reaching out and ministering to them It means rejoicing with those who are happy weeping with those who grieve lifting up those in distress and loving our neighbor as Christ loves us The Savior loves all of God s children regardless of their socioeconomic circumstance race religion language political orientation nationality or any other grouping And so should we God s greatest reward goes to those who serve without expectation of reward It goes to those who serve without fanfare those who quietly go about seeking ways to help others those who minister to others simply because they love God and God s children 5Don t InhaleShortly after my call as a new General Authority I had the privilege to accompany President James E Faust for a stake reorganization As I drove the car to our assignment in beautiful Southern Utah President Faust was kind enough to use the time to instruct and teach me One lesson I will never forget Said he The members of the Church are gracious to the General Authorities They will treat you kindly and say nice things about you Then he briefly paused and said Dieter always be thankful for this but don t you ever inhale it This important lesson about Church service applies to every priesthood holder in every quorum of the Church It applies to all of us in this Church When President J Reuben Clark Jr counseled those called to positions of authority in the Church he would tell them not to forget rule number six Inevitably the person would ask What is rule number six Don t take yourself too darn seriously he would say Of course this led to a follow up question What are the other five rules With a twinkle in his eye President Clark would say There aren t any 6To be effective Church leaders we must learn this critical lesson leadership in the Church is not so much about directing others as it is about our willingness to be directed by God Callings as Opportunities for ServiceAs Saints of the Most High God we are to remember in all things the poor and the needy the sick and the afflicted for he that doeth not these things the same is not my disciple 7 Opportunities to go about doing good and to serve others are limitless We can find them in our communities in our wards and branches and certainly in our homes In addition every member of the Church is given specific formal opportunities to serve We refer to these opportunities as callings a term that should remind us of who it is that calls us to serve If we approach our callings as opportunities to serve God and minister to others with faith and humility every act of service will be a step on the path of discipleship In this way God not only builds up His Church but also builds up His servants The Church is designed to help us become true and faithful disciples of Christ good and noble sons and daughters of God This happens not just when we go to meetings and listen to talks but also when we get outside ourselves and serve This is how we become great in the kingdom of God We accept callings with grace humility and gratitude When we are released from these callings we accept the change with the same grace humility and gratitude In the eyes of God there is no calling in the kingdom that is more important than another Our service whether great or small refines our spirits opens the windows of heaven and releases God s blessings not only upon those we serve but upon us as well When we reach out to others we can know with humble confidence that God acknowledges our service with approval and approbation He smiles upon us as we offer these heartfelt acts of compassion especially acts that are unseen and unnoticed by others 8Each time we give of ourselves to others we take a step closer to becoming good and true disciples of the One who gave His all for us our Savior From Presiding to the ParadeDuring the 150th anniversary of the pioneers arrival in the Salt Lake Valley Brother Myron Richins was serving as a stake president in Henefer Utah The celebration included a reenactment of the pioneers passage through his town President Richins was heavily involved with the plans for the celebration and he attended many meetings with General Authorities and others to discuss the events He was fully engaged Just before the actual celebration President Richins s stake was reorganized and he was released as president On a subsequent Sunday he was attending his ward priesthood meeting when the leaders asked for volunteers to help with the celebration President Richins along with others raised his hand and was given instructions to dress in work clothes and to bring his truck and a shovel Finally the morning of the big event came and President Richins reported to volunteer duty Only a few weeks before he had been an influential contributor to the planning and supervision of this major event On that day however his job was to follow the horses in the parade and clean up after them President Richins did so gladly and joyfully He understood that one kind of service is not above another He knew and put into practice the words of the Savior He that is greatest among you shall be your servant 9Doing Discipleship RightSometimes like the Sons of Thunder we desire positions of prominence We strive for recognition We seek to lead and to make a memorable contribution There is nothing wrong with wanting to serve the Lord but when we seek to gain influence in the Church for our own sake in order to receive the praise and admiration of men we have our reward When we inhale the praise of others that praise will be our compensation What is the most important calling in the Church It is the one you currently have No matter how humble or prominent it may seem to be the calling you have right now is the one that will allow you not only to lift others but also to become the man of God you were created to be My dear friends and brethren in the priesthood lift where you stand Paul taught the Philippians Instead of being motivated by selfish ambition or vanity each of you should in humility be moved to treat one another as more important than yourself 10Serving with HonorSeeking honor and celebrity in the Church at the expense of true and humble service toward others is the trade of Esau 11 We may receive an earthly reward but it comes at great cost the loss of heavenly approbation Let us follow the example of our Savior who was meek and lowly who sought not the praise of men but to do the will of His Father 12Let us serve others humbly with energy gratitude and honor Even though our acts of service may seem lowly modest or of little value those who reach out in kindness and compassion to others will one day know the value of their service by the eternal and blessed grace of Almighty God 13My dear brethren dear friends may we meditate upon understand and live this paramount lesson of Church leadership and priesthood governance He that is greatest among you shall be your servant This is my prayer and blessing in the sacred name of our Master our Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters dear friends what a privilege and joy it is to meet as a worldwide Church united in our faith and love for God and His children I am especially grateful for the presence of our beloved prophet Thomas S Monson President we will always take to heart your words of direction counsel and wisdom We love you President Monson and we always pray for you Years ago when I was serving as stake president in Frankfurt Germany a dear but unhappy sister approached me at the end of one of our stake meetings Isn t it terrible she said There must have been four or five people sound asleep during your talk I thought for a moment and answered I am pretty sure that church sleep is among the healthiest of all sleeps My wonderful wife Harriet overheard this casual exchange and later mentioned that it was one of the nicest answers I had ever given The Great AwakeningA few hundred years ago in North America a movement called the Great Awakening spread across the countryside One of its primary objectives was to awaken the people who appeared to be asleep regarding spiritual matters Young Joseph Smith was influenced by the things he heard from preachers who were part of this religious awakening It is one of the reasons he decided to seek earnestly the will of the Lord in private prayer These preachers had a dramatic emotional preaching style with sermons that were known for their heavy emphasis on the fiery terrors of hell that await the sinner 1 Their speeches didn t put people to sleep but they may have caused a few nightmares Their purpose and pattern seemed to be to frighten people into church Fear as ManipulationHistorically fear has often been used as a means to get people to take action Parents have used it with their children employers with employees and politicians with voters Experts in marketing understand the power of fear and often employ it This is why some advertisements seem to carry the implicit message that if we fail to buy their breakfast cereal or miss out on the newest video game or cell phone we run the risk of living a miserable life dying alone and unhappy We smile at this and think we would never fall for such manipulation but we sometimes do Worse we sometimes use similar methods to get others to do what we want My message has two purposes today The first is to urge us to contemplate and consider the extent to which we use fear to motivate others including ourselves The second is to suggest a better way The Problem with FearFirst let us address the problem with fear After all who among us has never been compelled by fear to eat better wear a seat belt exercise more save money or even repent of sin It is true that fear can have a powerful influence over our actions and behavior But that influence tends to be temporary and shallow Fear rarely has the power to change our hearts and it will never transform us into people who love what is right and who want to obey Heavenly Father People who are fearful may say and do the right things but they do not feel the right things They often feel helpless and resentful even angry Over time these feelings lead to mistrust defiance even rebellion Unfortunately this misguided approach to life and leadership is not limited to the secular world It grieves me to hear of Church members who exercise unrighteous dominion whether in their homes in their Church callings at work or in their daily interactions with others Often people may condemn bullying in others yet they cannot see it in themselves They demand compliance with their own arbitrary rules but when others don t follow these random rules they chasten them verbally emotionally and sometimes even physically The Lord has said that when we exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men in any degree of unrighteousness the heavens withdraw themselves and the Spirit of the Lord is grieved 2There may be moments when we are tempted to justify our actions by believing that the end justifies the means We might even think that to be controlling manipulative and harsh will be for the good of others Not so for the Lord has made it clear that the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance 3A Better WayThe more I come to know my Heavenly Father the more I see how He inspires and leads His children He is not angry vengeful or retaliatory 4 His very purpose His work and His glory is to mentor us exalt us and lead us to His fulness 5God described Himself to Moses as merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth 6Our Father in Heaven s love for us His children surpasses by far our ability to comprehend 7Does this mean that God condones or overlooks behaviors that run contrary to His commands No definitely not But He wants to change more than just our behaviors He wants to change our very natures He wants to change our hearts He wants us to reach out and take firm hold of the iron rod confront our fears and bravely step forward and upward along the strait and narrow path He wants this for us because He loves us and because this is the way to happiness So how does God motivate His children to follow Him in our day He sent His Son God sent His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ to show us the right way God motivates through persuasion long suffering gentleness meekness and love unfeigned 8 God is on our side He loves us and when we stumble He wants us to rise up try again and become stronger He is our mentor He is our great and cherished hope He desires to stimulate us with faith He trusts us to learn from our missteps and make correct choices This is the better way 9What of the Evils of the World One of the ways Satan wants us to manipulate others is by dwelling upon and even exaggerating the evil in the world Certainly our world has always been and will continue to be imperfect Far too many innocent people suffer because of circumstances of nature as well as from man s inhumanity The corruption and wickedness in our day are unique and alarming But in spite of all this I wouldn t trade living in this time with any other time in the history of the world We are blessed beyond measure to live in a day of unparalleled prosperity enlightenment and advantage Most of all we are blessed to have the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ which gives us a unique perspective on the world s dangers and shows us how to either avoid these dangers or deal with them When I think of these blessings I want to fall to my knees and offer praises to our Heavenly Father for His never ending love for all of His children I don t believe God wants His children to be fearful or dwell on the evils of the world For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind 10He has given us an abundance of reasons to rejoice We just need to find and to recognize them The Lord often reminds us to be not afraid to be of good cheer 11 and to fear not little flock 12The Lord Will Fight Our BattlesBrothers and sisters we are the Lord s little flock We are the Saints of the latter days Inherent in our name is the commitment to look forward to the Savior s return and prepare ourselves and the world to receive Him Therefore let us serve God and love our fellowmen Let us do this with a natural confidence with humility never looking down on any other religion or group of people Brothers and sisters we are charged with studying the word of God and heeding the voice of the Spirit that we may know the signs of the times and the signs of the coming of the Son of Man 13We are therefore not ignorant of the challenges of the world nor are we unaware of the difficulties of our times But this does not mean that we should burden ourselves or others with constant fear Rather than dwelling on the immensity of our challenges would it not be better to focus on the infinite greatness goodness and absolute power of our God trusting Him and preparing with a joyful heart for the return of Jesus the Christ As His covenant people we need not be paralyzed by fear because bad things might happen Instead we can move forward with faith courage determination and trust in God as we approach the challenges and opportunities ahead 14We do not walk the path of discipleship alone The Lord thy God doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee 15 The Lord will fight for you and you shall hold your peace 16In the face of fear let us find our courage muster our faith and have confidence in the promise that no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper 17Do we live in a time of peril and turmoil Of course we do God Himself has said In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 18Can we exercise the faith to believe and to act accordingly Can we live up to our commitments and sacred covenants Can we keep the commandments of God even in challenging circumstances Of course we can We can because God has promised All things shall work together for your good if you walk uprightly 19 Therefore let us set aside our fears and live instead with joy humility hope and a bold confidence that the Lord is with us Perfect Love Casteth Out FearMy beloved friends my dear brothers and sisters in Christ if we ever find ourselves living in fear or anxiety or if we ever find that our own words attitudes or actions are causing fear in others I pray with all the strength of my soul that we may become liberated from this fear by the divinely appointed antidote to fear the pure love of Christ for perfect love casteth out fear 20Christ s perfect love overcomes temptations to harm coerce bully or oppress Christ s perfect love allows us to walk with humility dignity and a bold confidence as followers of our beloved Savior Christ s perfect love gives us the confidence to press through our fears and place our complete trust in the power and goodness of our Heavenly Father and of His Son Jesus Christ In our homes in our places of business in our Church callings in our hearts let us replace fear with Christ s perfect love Christ s love will replace fear with faith His love will enable us to recognize trust and have faith in our Heavenly Father s goodness His divine plan His gospel and His commandments 21 Loving God and our fellowmen will turn our obedience to God s commandments into a blessing rather than a burden Christ s love will help us become a little kinder more forgiving more caring and more dedicated to His work As we fill our hearts with the love of Christ we will awaken with a renewed spiritual freshness and we will walk joyfully confidently awake and alive in the light and glory of our beloved Savior Jesus Christ I testify with the Apostle John There is no fear in Christ s love 22 Brothers and sisters dear friends God knows you perfectly He loves you perfectly He knows what your future holds He wants you to be not afraid only believe 23 and abide in his perfect love 24 This is my prayer and blessing in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear sisters dear friends how blessed we are to assemble again in this worldwide conference under the direction and leadership of our dear prophet and President Thomas S Monson President we love you and we sustain you We know you love the sisters of the Church I love attending this wonderful session of general conference devoted to the sisters of the Church Sisters when I see you I cannot help but think of the women who have been so influential in my life my grandmother and mother who were the first to accept the invitation to come and see what the Church is all about 1 There is my beloved wife Harriet with whom I fell in love the first time I saw her There is Harriet s mother who joined the Church not long after losing her husband to cancer Then my sister my daughter my granddaughter and my great granddaughter all of these individuals have been refining influences for me They truly bring sunshine into my life They inspire me to become a better man and a more sensitive Church leader How different my life would be without them Perhaps what humbles me most is to know that the same influence is replicated millions of times throughout the Church through the abilities talents intelligence and testimony of women of faith like you Now some of you might not feel worthy of such high praise You might think you are too insignificant to have a meaningful influence on others Perhaps you don t even consider yourself a woman of faith because you sometimes struggle with doubt or fear Today I wish to speak to anyone who has ever felt this way and that probably includes all of us at one time or another I wish to speak of faith what it is what it can and cannot do and what we must do to activate the power of faith in our lives What Faith IsFaith is a strong conviction about something we believe a conviction so strong that it moves us to do things that we otherwise might not do Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see 2While this makes sense to believing people it is often confusing to nonbelievers They shake their heads and ask How can anyone be certain of what they cannot see To them this is evidence of the irrationality of religion What they fail to understand is that there are more ways to see than with our eyes more ways to feel than with our hands more ways to hear than with our ears It s something like the experience of a young girl who was walking with her grandmother The song of the birds was glorious to the little girl and she pointed out every sound to her grandmother Do you hear that the little girl asked again and again But her grandmother was hard of hearing and could not make out the sounds Finally the grandmother knelt down and said I m sorry dear Grandma doesn t hear so well Exasperated the little girl took her grandmother s face in her hands looked intently into her eyes and said Grandma listen harder There are lessons in this story for both the nonbeliever and the believer Just because we can t hear something doesn t mean there is nothing to hear Two people can listen to the same message or read the same scripture and one might feel the witness of the Spirit while the other doesn t On the other hand in our efforts to help our loved ones experience the voice of the Spirit and the vast eternal and profound beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ telling them to listen harder may not be the most helpful way Perhaps better advice for anyone who wants to increase faith is to listen differently The Apostle Paul encourages us to seek the voice that speaks to our spirit not just to our ears He taught The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit 3 Or perhaps we should consider the words of Saint Exup ry s Little Prince who said One sees clearly only with the heart Anything essential is invisible to the eyes 4The Power and Limits of FaithSometimes it s not easy to develop faith in spiritual things while living in a physical world But it is worth the effort because the power of faith in our lives can be profound The scriptures teach us that through faith the worlds were framed waters were parted dead were raised and rivers and mountains were moved from their course 5Yet some might ask If faith is so powerful why can t I receive an answer to a heartfelt prayer I don t need a sea to part or a mountain to move I just need my illness to go away or my parents to forgive each other or an eternal companion to appear on my doorstep with a bouquet of flowers in one hand and an engagement ring in the other Why can t my faith accomplish that Faith is powerful and often it does result in miracles But no matter how much faith we have there are two things faith cannot do For one it cannot violate another person s agency One woman prayed for years that her wayward daughter would return to the fold of Christ and felt discouraged that her prayers had seemingly gone unanswered This was especially painful when she heard stories of other prodigal children who had repented of their ways The problem was not a lack of prayers or a shortage of faith She needed only to understand that as painful as it might be for our Father in Heaven He will not force anyone to choose the path of righteousness God did not force His own children to follow Him in the premortal world How much less will He force us now as we journey through this mortal life God will invite persuade God will reach out tirelessly with love and inspiration and encouragement But God will never compel that would undermine His great plan for our eternal growth The second thing faith cannot do is force our will upon God We cannot force God to comply with our desires no matter how right we think we are or how sincerely we pray Consider the experience of Paul who pleaded with the Lord multiple times for relief from a personal trial what he called a thorn in the flesh But that was not God s will Eventually Paul realized that his trial was a blessing and he thanked God for not answering his prayers the way he had hoped 6Trust and FaithNo the purpose of faith is not to change God s will but to empower us to act on God s will Faith is trust trust that God sees what we cannot and that He knows what we do not 7 Sometimes trusting our own vision and judgment is not enough I learned this as an airline pilot on days when I had to fly into thick fog or clouds and could see only a few feet ahead I had to rely on the instruments that told me where I was and where I was headed I had to listen to the voice of air traffic control I had to follow the guidance of someone with more accurate information than I had Someone whom I could not see but whom I had learned to trust Someone who could see what I could not I had to trust and act accordingly to arrive safely at my destination Faith means that we trust not only in God s wisdom but that we trust also in His love It means trusting that God loves us perfectly that everything He does every blessing He gives and every blessing He for a time withholds is for our eternal happiness 8With this kind of faith though we may not understand why certain things happen or why certain prayers go unanswered we can know that in the end everything will make sense All things will work together for good to them that love God 9All will be made right All will be well We can be certain that answers will come and we may be confident that we will not only be content with the answers but we will also be overwhelmed by the grace mercy generosity and love of our Heavenly Father for us His children Just Keep KnockingUntil then we walk by whatever faith we have 10 seeking always to increase our faith Sometimes this is not an easy quest Those who are impatient uncommitted or careless may find faith to be elusive Those who are easily discouraged or distracted may hardly experience it Faith comes to the humble the diligent the enduring It comes to those who pay the price of faithfulness This truth is illustrated in the experience of two young missionaries serving in Europe in an area where there were few convert baptisms I suppose it would have been understandable for them to think that what they did wouldn t make much of a difference But these two missionaries had faith and they were committed They had the attitude that if no one listened to their message it would not be because they had not given their best effort One day they had the feeling to approach the residents of a well kept four story apartment building They started on the first floor and knocked on each door presenting their saving message of Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His Church No one on the first floor would listen to them How easy it would have been to say We tried Let s stop right here Let s go and try another building But these two missionaries had faith and they were willing to work and so they knocked on every door on the second floor Again no one would listen The third floor was the same And so was the fourth that is until they knocked on the last door of the fourth floor When that door opened a young girl smiled at them and asked them to wait while she spoke with her mother Her mother was only 36 years old had recently lost her husband and was in no mood to talk with Mormon missionaries So she told her daughter to send them away But the daughter pleaded with her These young men were so nice she said And it would take only a few minutes So reluctantly the mother agreed The missionaries delivered their message and handed a book to the mother to read the Book of Mormon After they left the mother decided she would read at least a few pages She finished the entire book within a few days Not long after this wonderful single parent family entered the waters of baptism When the small family attended their local branch in Frankfurt Germany a young deacon noticed the beauty of one of the daughters and thought to himself These missionaries are doing a great job That young deacon s name was Dieter Uchtdorf And the charming young woman the one who had pleaded with her mother to listen to the missionaries has the beautiful name of Harriet She is loved by all who meet her as she accompanies me in my travels She has blessed the lives of many people through her love for the gospel and her sparkling personality She truly is the sunshine of my life How often have I lifted my heart in gratitude for the two missionaries who did not stop at the first floor How often my heart reaches out in appreciation for their faith and work How often have I given thanks that they kept going even to the fourth floor last door It Shall Be Opened unto YouIn our search for enduring faith in our quest to connect with God and His purposes let us remember the Lord s promise Knock and it shall be opened unto you 11Will we give up after knocking on a door or two A floor or two Or will we keep seeking until we have reached the fourth floor last door God rewards those who earnestly seek him 12 but that reward is not usually behind the first door So we need to keep knocking Sisters don t give up Seek God with all your heart Exercise faith Walk in righteousness I promise that if you will do this even until the fourth floor last door you will receive the answers you seek You will find faith And one day you will be filled with light that grows brighter and brighter until the perfect day 13My beloved sisters in Christ God is real He lives He loves you He knows you He understands you He knows the silent pleadings of your heart He has not abandoned you He will not forsake you It is my testimony and apostolic blessing to each one of you that you will feel in your heart and mind this sublime truth for yourselves Live in faith dear friends dear sisters and the Lord our God will increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised 14I leave you my faith my conviction and my certain and unshakable witness that this is the work of God In the sacred name of our beloved Savior in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Alma the YoungerAmong the most unforgettable characters in scripture is Alma the Younger Though he was the son of a great prophet he lost his way for a time and became a wicked and an idolatrous man For reasons we can only guess he actively opposed his father and sought to destroy the Church And because of his eloquence and persuasiveness he experienced great success 1But Alma s life changed when an angel of the Lord appeared to him and spoke with a voice of thunder For three days and three nights Alma was racked with eternal torment even with the pains of a damned soul And then somehow a faint memory brought light to the darkness of his mind an eternal truth taught by his father that Jesus Christ would come to atone for the sins of the world Alma had long ago rejected such concepts but now his mind caught hold upon this thought and he humbly earnestly placed his trust in Christ s atoning power 2When Alma emerged from this experience he was a changed man From that moment on he devoted his life to undoing the damage he had caused He is a powerful example of repentance forgiveness and enduring faithfulness Alma was eventually chosen to succeed his father as head of the Church of God Every citizen of the Nephite nation must have known Alma s story The Twitters Instagrams and Facebooks of his day would have been filled with images and stories about him He probably appeared regularly on the cover of the Zarahemla Weekly and was the subject of editorials and network specials In short he was perhaps the most well known celebrity of his day But when Alma saw that his people were forgetting God and lifting themselves up in pride and contention he chose to resign from public office and dedicate himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God 3 preaching repentance among the Nephites At first Alma had great success that is until he traveled to the city of Ammonihah The people of that city were well aware that Alma was no longer their political leader and they had little respect for his priesthood authority They reviled him ridiculed him and cast him out of their city Heartbroken Alma turned his back on the city Ammonihah 4But an angel told him to return Just think about it he was told to return to the people who hated him and were hostile toward the Church It was a dangerous and perhaps life threatening assignment But Alma did not hesitate He returned speedily 5Alma had been fasting many days when he entered the city There he asked a complete stranger if he would give to an humble servant of God something to eat 6AmulekThis man s name was Amulek Amulek was a well to do well known citizen of Ammonihah Although he came from a long line of believers his own faith had grown cold He later confessed I was called many times and I would not hear therefore I knew concerning these things yet I would not believe therefore I went on rebelling against God 7But God was preparing Amulek and when Amulek met Alma he welcomed the Lord s servant into his home where Alma stayed for many days 8 During that time Amulek opened his heart to Alma s message and a marvelous change came over him From then on Amulek not only believed but he also became a champion of truth When Alma went out again to teach among the people of Ammonihah he had a second witness at his side Amulek one of their own The events that followed constitute one of the most bittersweet narratives in all of scripture You can read about it in Alma chapters 8 16 Today I would like to ask you to consider two questions First What can I learn from Alma Second How am I like Amulek What Can I Learn from Alma Let me begin by asking all past current or future leaders in the Church of Jesus Christ What can you learn from Alma Alma was an exceptionally gifted and capable man It may have been easy to think that he did not need anyone s help Nevertheless what did Alma do when he returned to Ammonihah Alma found Amulek and asked him for help And Alma received help For whatever reason sometimes we as leaders are reluctant to find and ask our Amuleks Perhaps we think that we can do the work better by ourselves or we are reluctant to inconvenience others or we assume that others would not want to participate Too often we hesitate to invite people to use their God given talents and engage in the great work of salvation Think of the Savior did He begin to establish His Church all alone No His message was not Stand back I ll handle this Rather it was Come follow me 9 He inspired invited instructed and then trusted His followers to do the things which ye have seen me do 10 In this way Jesus Christ built up not only His Church but also His servants In whatever position you currently serve whether you are a deacons quorum president a stake president or an Area President to be successful you must find your Amuleks It may be someone who is unassuming or even invisible within your congregations It may be someone who seems unwilling or unable to serve Your Amuleks may be young or old men or women inexperienced tired or not active in the Church But what may not be seen at first sight is that they are hoping to hear from you the words The Lord needs you I need you Deep down many want to serve their God They want to be an instrument in His hands They want to thrust in their sickle and strive with their might to prepare the earth for the return of our Savior They want to build His Church But they are reluctant to begin Often they wait to be asked I invite you to think of those in your branches and wards in your missions and stakes who need to hear a call to action The Lord has been working with them preparing them softening their hearts Find them by seeing with your heart Reach out to them Teach them Inspire them Ask them Share with them the words of the angel to Amulek that the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon them and their house 11 You may be surprised to discover a valiant servant of the Lord who otherwise would have remained hidden How Am I Like Amulek While some of us should be looking for an Amulek for others the question might be How am I like Amulek Perhaps you have over the years become less committed in your discipleship Perhaps the fire of your testimony has dimmed Perhaps you have distanced yourself from the body of Christ Perhaps you have become disillusioned or even angry Like some of the ancient Church of Ephesus you may have left your first love 12 the sublime eternal truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ Perhaps like Amulek you know in your heart that the Lord has called you many times but you would not hear Nevertheless the Lord sees in you what He saw in Amulek the potential of a valiant servant with an important work to do and with a testimony to share There is service that no one else can give in quite the same way The Lord has trusted you with His holy priesthood which holds the divine potential to bless and lift others Listen with your heart and follow the promptings of the Spirit One Member s JourneyI was touched by the journey of one brother who asked himself When the Lord calls will I hear I will call this fine brother David David converted to the Church some 30 years ago He served a mission and then attended law school While he was studying and working to support a young family he came across some information about the Church that confused him The more he read these negative materials the more unsettled he became Eventually he asked to have his name removed from the records of the Church From that time on like Alma in his rebellious days David spent a great deal of time debating with members of the Church engaging in online conversations with the purpose of challenging their beliefs He was very good at this One of the members he debated with I will call Jacob Jacob was always kind and respectful to David but he was also firm in his defense of the Church Over the years David and Jacob developed a mutual respect and friendship What David did not know is that Jacob was praying for David and did so faithfully for more than a decade He even placed his friend s name for prayer in the temples of the Lord and hoped that David s heart would be softened Over time slowly David did change He began to remember with fondness the spiritual experiences he once had and he remembered the happiness he had felt when he was a member of the Church Like Alma David had not completely forgotten the gospel truths he had once embraced And like Amulek David felt the Lord reaching out to him David was now a partner in a law firm a prestigious job He had developed a reputation as a critic of the Church and he had too much pride to ask to be readmitted Nevertheless he continued to feel the pull of the Shepherd He took to heart the scripture If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him 13 He prayed Dear God I want to be a Latter day Saint again but I have questions that need answers He began to listen to the whisperings of the Spirit and to inspired answers of friends as he never had before One after another his doubts turned to faith until finally he realized that once again he could feel a testimony of Jesus Christ and His restored Church At that point he knew that he would be able to overcome his pride and do whatever it took to be accepted back into the Church Eventually David entered the waters of baptism and then began counting down the days until he could have his blessings restored I am happy to report that this past summer David s blessings were restored to him He is again fully participating in the Church and serving as a Gospel Doctrine teacher in his ward He takes every opportunity to speak to others about his transformation to heal the damage he caused and to bear testimony of the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ ConclusionMy dear brothers my dear friends let us seek out find inspire and rely upon the Amuleks in our wards and stakes There are many Amuleks in the Church today Perhaps you know one Perhaps you are one Perhaps the Lord has been whispering to you urging you to return to your first love contribute your talents worthily exercise the priesthood and serve side by side with your fellow Saints in drawing closer to Jesus Christ and building the kingdom of God here on earth Our beloved Savior knows where you are He knows your heart He wants to rescue you He will reach out to you Just open your heart to Him It is my hope that those who have strayed from the path of discipleship even by only a few degrees will contemplate the goodness and grace of God see with their hearts learn from Alma and Amulek and hear the life changing words of the Savior Come follow me I urge you to heed His call for surely you will receive the harvest of heaven The blessings of the Lord will rest upon you and your house 14Of this I testify and leave you my blessing as an Apostle of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
How blessed we are to assemble again in this worldwide conference under the direction and leadership of our dear prophet and President Thomas S Monson President we love you and we sustain you with all our hearts During my professional life as a pilot I relied greatly on the precision and reliability of computer systems but rarely had to work my own personal computer In my office work as an executive I had assistants and secretaries who kindly helped me with the tasks All this changed in 1994 when I was called as a General Authority My calling consisted of many wonderful opportunities to minister but it also included a great deal of Church office work more than I ever thought possible To my shock the main tool to stay on top of my work was a personal computer For the first time in my life I had to delve into this strange mystifying incomprehensible world From the start the computer and I were not on the friendliest of terms Able tech people tried to teach me how to use the computer They literally stood behind me reaching over my shoulder their fingers moving quickly and tapping a percussive symphony against the keyboard See they would say proudly That s how you do it I did not see It was a rocky transition My learning curve was more like a brick wall It took a great deal of time repetition patience no small amount of hope and faith lots of reassurance from my wife and many liters of a diet soda that shall remain nameless Now 22 years later I am surrounded by computer technology I have an email address a Twitter account and a Facebook page I own a smartphone a tablet a laptop and a digital camera And while my tech skills may not quite measure up to those of a typical seven year old for a septuagenarian I do all right But I have noticed something interesting The more adept I get at technology the more I take it for granted For a large part of human history communication happened at the speed of a horse Sending a message and getting a reply could take days or even months Today our messages travel thousands of miles into the sky or thousands of meters beneath the oceans to reach someone on the other side of the world and if there is a delay of even a few seconds we get frustrated and impatient It seems to be human nature as we become more familiar with something even something miraculous and awe inspiring we lose our sense of awe and treat it as commonplace Do We Take Spiritual Truths for Granted Taking for granted our modern technologies and conveniences may be a relatively small matter But sadly we sometimes take a similar attitude toward the eternal and soul expanding doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ In the Church of Jesus Christ we have been given so much We are surrounded by such an astonishing wealth of light and truth that I wonder if we truly appreciate what we have Think of those early disciples who walked and talked with the Savior during His earthly ministry Imagine the thanksgiving and reverence that must have flooded their hearts and filled their minds when they saw Him risen from the tomb when they felt the wounds in His hands Their lives would never be the same Think of the early Saints of this dispensation who knew the Prophet Joseph Smith and heard him preach the restored gospel Imagine how they must have felt to know that the veil between heaven and earth had parted again shedding light and knowledge upon the world from our celestial home above But most of all think of how you felt when for the first time you believed and understood that you are truly a child of God that Jesus Christ willingly suffered for your sins so that you may be clean again that priesthood power is real and can bind you to your loved ones for time and for all eternity that there is a living prophet on the earth today Isn t that wonderful and amazing Considering all of this how could it ever be possible that we of all people would not be excited about attending our Church worship services Or get tired of reading the holy scriptures I suppose this could be possible only if our hearts were past feeling to experience gratitude and awe for the sacred and sublime gifts God has granted us Life changing truths are before our eyes and at our fingertips but sometimes we sleepwalk on the path of discipleship Too often we let ourselves be distracted by the imperfections of our fellow members instead of following the example of our Master We tread a path covered with diamonds but we can scarcely distinguish them from ordinary pebbles A Familiar MessageWhen I was a young man my friends would ask me about my religion Often I would start to explain the differences like the Word of Wisdom Other times I would emphasize the similarities with other Christian religions None of this would impress them very much But when I talked about the great plan of happiness our Father in Heaven has for us as His children I had their attention I remember trying to draw the plan of salvation on a blackboard in a classroom of our chapel in Frankfurt Germany I made circles that represented premortal life mortality and the return to our Heavenly Parents after this life As a teenager how I loved to share this exciting message When I explained these principles in my own simple words my heart would overflow with gratitude for a God who loves His children and a Savior who redeemed all of us from death and hell I was so proud of this message of love joy and hope Some of my friends would say that this message felt familiar even though such things were never taught in their religious upbringing It was as if they had always known these things to be true as if I was simply casting light on something that was always and deeply rooted in their hearts We Have Answers I believe every human being carries in his or her heart some form of fundamental questions regarding life itself Where did I come from Why am I here What will happen after I die These kinds of questions have been asked by mortals since the dawn of time Philosophers scholars and pundits have spent their lives and fortunes seeking for answers I am grateful that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ has answers to the most complex questions in life These answers are taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints They are true plain straightforward and easy to understand They are inspired and we teach them to our three year olds in the Sunbeam class Brothers and sisters we are eternal beings without beginning and without end We have always existed 1 We are the literal spirit children of divine immortal and omnipotent Heavenly Parents We come from the heavenly courts of the Lord our God We are of the royal house of Elohim the Most High God We walked with Him in our premortal life We heard Him speak witnessed His majesty learned His ways You and I participated in a Grand Council where our beloved Father presented His plan for us that we would come to earth receive mortal bodies learn to choose between good and evil and progress in ways that would not otherwise be possible When we passed through the veil and entered this mortal life we knew that we would no longer remember the life before There would be opposition and adversity and temptation But we also knew that gaining a physical body was of paramount importance for us Oh how we hoped that we would quickly learn to make the correct choices withstand the temptations of Satan and eventually return to our beloved Parents in Heaven We knew we would sin and make mistakes perhaps even serious ones But we also knew that our Savior Jesus Christ had pledged to come to earth live a sinless life and voluntarily lay down His life in an eternal sacrifice We knew that if we gave our heart to Him trusted Him and strived with all the energy of our soul to walk in the path of discipleship we could be washed clean and once again enter the presence of our beloved Father in Heaven So with faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ you and I accepted by our free will Heavenly Father s plan That is why we are here on this beautiful planet earth because God offered us the opportunity and we chose to accept it Our mortal life however is only temporary and will end with the death of our physical body But the essence of who you and I are will not be destroyed Our spirits will continue living and await the Resurrection a free gift to all by our loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ 2 At the Resurrection our spirits and bodies will be reunited free from pain and physical imperfections After the Resurrection there will be a Day of Judgment While all will eventually be saved and inherit a kingdom of glory those who trust in God and seek to follow His laws and ordinances will inherit lives in the eternities that are unimaginable in glory and overwhelming in majesty That Day of Judgment will be a day of mercy and love a day when broken hearts are healed when tears of grief are replaced with tears of gratitude when all will be made right 3Yes there will be deep sorrow because of sin Yes there will be regrets and even anguish because of our mistakes our foolishness and our stubbornness that caused us to miss opportunities for a much greater future But I have confidence that we will not only be satisfied with the judgment of God we will also be astonished and overwhelmed by His infinite grace mercy generosity and love for us His children If our desires and works are good if we have faith in a living God then we can look forward to what Moroni called the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah the Eternal Judge 4Pro Tanto Quid RetribuamusMy beloved brothers and sisters my dear friends does it not fill our hearts and minds with wonder and awe to contemplate the great plan of happiness our Heavenly Father has prepared for us Does it not fill us with unspeakable joy to know of the glorious future that is prepared for all who wait upon the Lord If you have never felt such wonder and joy I invite you to seek study and ponder the simple yet profound truths of the restored gospel Let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds 5 Let them bear testimony unto you of the divine plan of salvation If you have felt these things before I ask you today Can you feel so now 6Recently I had the opportunity to travel to Belfast Northern Ireland While there I noticed the Belfast Coat of Arms which includes the motto Pro tanto quid retribuamus or What shall we give in return for so much 7I invite each of us to consider this question What shall we give in return for the flood of light and truth God has poured out upon us Our beloved Father simply asks that we live by the truth we have received and that we follow the path He has provided Therefore let us take courage and trust in the guidance of the Spirit Let us in word and in deed share with our fellowmen the amazing and awe inspiring message of God s plan of happiness May our motive be our love for God and for His children for they are our brothers and sisters This is the beginning of what we can do in return for so much Someday every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that God s ways are just and His plan is perfect 8 For you and me let that day be today Let us proclaim with Jacob of old O how great the plan of our God 9Of this I testify in deep gratitude to our Heavenly Father as I leave you my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ amen

Many years ago I was at the Frankfurt Germany Temple when I noticed an elderly couple holding hands The caring tenderness and affection they showed to each other warmed my heart I m not completely sure why this scene affected me so profoundly Perhaps it was the sweetness of the love these two people shared for one another a compelling symbol of perseverance and commitment It was clear that this couple had been together for a long time and their affection for one another was still alive and strong A Society of DisposablesI think another reason this tender scene has stayed with me for so long is the contrast to some of today s attitudes In so many societies around the world everything seems to be disposable As soon as something starts to break down or wear out or even when we simply grow tired of it we throw it out and replace it with an upgrade something newer or shinier We do this with cell phones clothes cars and tragically even with relationships While there may be value in decluttering our lives of material things we no longer need when it comes to things of eternal importance our marriages our families and our values a mind set of replacing the original in favor of the modern can bring profound remorse I am grateful that I belong to a church that values marriage and family Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints are known throughout the world for having some of the finest marriages and families you can find I believe this is in part due to the precious truth restored by Joseph Smith that marriages and families are meant to be eternal Families are not just meant to make things run more smoothly here on earth and to be cast off when we get to heaven Rather they are the order of heaven They are an echo of a celestial pattern and an emulation of God s eternal family But strong marriage and family relationships do not happen just because we are members of the Church They require constant intentional work The doctrine of eternal families must inspire us to dedicate our best efforts to saving and enriching our marriages and families I admire and applaud those who have preserved and nourished these critical eternal relationships Today I wish to speak in praise of those who save Saving Our MarriagesOver the years I have performed the sealing ordinance for many hopeful and loving couples I have never met anyone who as they looked at each other across the altar thought they would end up divorced or heartbroken Unfortunately some do Somehow as the days multiply and the color of romantic love changes there are some who slowly stop thinking of each other s happiness and start noticing the little faults In such an environment some are enticed by the tragic conclusion that their spouse isn t smart enough fun enough or young enough And somehow they get the idea that this gives them justification to start looking elsewhere Brethren if this comes close to describing you at all I warn you that you are on a road that leads to broken marriages broken homes and broken hearts I plead with you to stop now turn around and come back to the safe path of integrity and loyalty to covenants And of course the same principles apply for our dear sisters Now just one word to those of our single brethren who follow the deception that they first have to find the perfect woman before they can enter into serious courting or marriage My beloved brethren may I remind you if there were a perfect woman do you really think she would be that interested in you In God s plan of happiness we are not so much looking for someone perfect but for a person with whom throughout a lifetime we can join efforts to create a loving lasting and more perfect relationship That is the goal Brethren those who save their marriages understand that this pursuit takes time patience and above all the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ It requires you to be kind envy not seek not your own not be easily provoked think no evil and rejoice in the truth In other words it requires charity the pure love of Christ 1All this won t just happen in an instant Great marriages are built brick by brick day after day over a lifetime And that is good news Because no matter how flat your relationship may be at the present if you keep adding pebbles of kindness compassion listening sacrifice understanding and selflessness eventually a mighty pyramid will begin to grow If it appears to take forever remember happy marriages are meant to last forever So be not weary in well doing for ye are laying the foundation of a great marriage And out of small things proceedeth that which is great 2It may be a gradual work but it doesn t have to be a cheerless one In fact at the risk of stating the obvious divorce rarely happens when the husband and wife are happy So be happy And brethren astonish your wife by doing things that make her happy Those who save their marriages choose happiness While it s true that some types of chronic depression require specialized treatment I am fond of this bit of wisdom by Abraham Lincoln Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be It fits nicely with its scriptural companion Seek and ye shall find 3If we look for imperfections in our spouse or irritations in our marriage we will certainly find them because everyone has some On the other hand if we look for the good we will surely find it because everyone has many good qualities too Those who save marriages pull out the weeds and water the flowers They celebrate the small acts of grace that spark tender feelings of charity Those who save marriages save future generations Brethren remember why you fell in love Work each day to make your marriage stronger and happier My dear friends let us do our very best to be numbered among those hallowed and happy souls who save their marriages Saving Our FamiliesToday I also wish to speak in praise of those who save their relationships with their families Every family needs saving As wonderful as it is that this Church is known for its strong families we may often feel this must apply to every Latter day Saint family except ours But the reality is that there are no perfect families Every family has moments of awkwardness Like when your parents ask you to take a selfie of them or when your great aunt insists that you are still single because you are just too picky or when your opinionated brother in law thinks his political view is the gospel view or when your dad arranges a family portrait with everyone dressed like characters in his favorite movie And you get the Chewbacca costume Families are like that We may share the same gene pool but we are not the same We have unique spirits We are influenced in different ways by our experiences And each of us ends up different as a result Rather than attempting to force everyone into a mold of our own making we can choose to celebrate these differences and appreciate them for adding richness and constant surprises to our lives Sometimes however members of our families make choices or do things that are thoughtless hurtful or immoral What should we do in these cases There is not one solution that covers every situation Those who save their families are successful because they counsel with their spouse and family seek the will of the Lord and listen for the promptings of the Holy Ghost They know that what is right for one family may not be right for another However there is one thing that is right in every case In the Book of Mormon we learn of a people who had discovered the secret to happiness For generations there was no contention And surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God How did they do it Because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people 4Whatever problems your family is facing whatever you must do to solve them the beginning and the end of the solution is charity the pure love of Christ Without this love even seemingly perfect families struggle With it even families with great challenges succeed Charity never faileth 5It is true for saving marriages It is true for saving families Set Aside PrideThe great enemy of charity is pride Pride is one of the biggest reasons marriages and families struggle Pride is short tempered unkind and envious Pride exaggerates its own strength and ignores the virtues of others Pride is selfish and easily provoked Pride assumes evil intent where there is none and hides its own weaknesses behind clever excuses Pride is cynical pessimistic angry and impatient Indeed if charity is the pure love of Christ then pride is the defining characteristic of Satan Pride may be a common human failing But it is not part of our spiritual heritage and it has no place among holders of the priesthood of God Life is short brethren Regrets can last a long time some will have repercussions that echo through eternity The way you treat your wife or children or parents or siblings may influence generations to come What legacy do you want to leave your posterity One of harshness vengeance anger fear or isolation Or one of love humility forgiveness compassion spiritual growth and unity We all need to remember Judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy 6For the sake of your family relationships for the sake of your soul please be merciful for mercy triumphs over judgment 7Set aside pride Sincerely apologizing to your children your wife your family or your friends is not a sign of weakness but of strength Is being right more important than fostering an environment of nurturing healing and love Build bridges don t destroy them Even when you are not at fault perhaps especially when you are not at fault let love conquer pride If you do this whatever adversity you are facing will pass and because of the love of God in your hearts contention will fade These principles of saving relationships apply to all of us regardless of whether we are married divorced widowed or single We all can be saviors of strong families The Greatest LoveBrethren in our efforts to save our marriages and families as in all things let us follow the example of the One who saves us The Savior won our souls with love 8 Jesus Christ is our Master His work is our work It is a saving work and it begins in our homes Love in the fabric of the plan of salvation is selfless and seeks the well being of others That is the love our Heavenly Father has for us As we emulate the Savior s love He will surely bless and prosper our righteous efforts to save our marriages and strengthen our families May the Lord bless you in your untiring and righteous efforts to be numbered among those who save This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
One of my haunting childhood memories begins with the howl of distant air raid sirens that awaken me from sleep Before long another sound the rattle and hum of propellers gradually increases until it shakes the very air Trained well by our mother we children each grab our bag and run up the hill to a bomb shelter As we hurry through the pitch dark night green and white flares drop from the sky to mark the targets for the bombers Strangely enough everyone calls these flares Christmas trees I am four years old and I am a witness to a world at war DresdenNot far from where my family lived was the city of Dresden Those who lived there witnessed perhaps a thousand times what I had seen Massive firestorms caused by thousands of tons of explosives swept through Dresden destroying more than 90 percent of the city and leaving little but rubble and ash in their wake In a very short time the city once nicknamed the Jewel Box was no more Erich K stner a German author wrote of the destruction In a thousand years was her beauty built in one night was it utterly destroyed 1 During my childhood I could not imagine how the destruction of a war our own people had started could ever be overcome The world around us appeared totally hopeless and without any future Last year I had the opportunity to return to Dresden Seventy years after the war it is once again a Jewel Box of a city The ruins have been cleared and the city is restored and even improved During my visit I saw the beautiful Lutheran church Frauenkirche the Church of Our Lady Originally built in the 1700s it had been one of Dresden s shining jewels but the war reduced it to a pile of rubble For many years it remained that way until finally it was determined that the Frauenkirche would be rebuilt Stones from the destroyed church had been stored and cataloged and when possible were used in the reconstruction Today you can see these fire blackened stones pockmarking the outer walls These scars are not only a reminder of the war history of this building but also a monument to hope a magnificent symbol of man s ability to create new life from ashes As I pondered the history of Dresden and marveled at the ingenuity and resolve of those who restored what had been so completely destroyed I felt the sweet influence of the Holy Spirit Surely I thought if man can take the ruins rubble and remains of a broken city and rebuild an awe inspiring structure that rises toward the heavens how much more capable is our Almighty Father to restore His children who have fallen struggled or become lost It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem It matters not how scarlet our sins how deep our bitterness how lonely abandoned or broken our hearts may be Even those who are without hope who live in despair who have betrayed trust surrendered their integrity or turned away from God can be rebuilt Save those rare sons of perdition there is no life so shattered that it cannot be restored The joyous news of the gospel is this because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God s indescribable glory The Parable of the Lost SheepDuring the Savior s ministry the religious leaders of His day disapproved of Jesus spending time with people they had labeled sinners Perhaps to them it looked like He was tolerating or even condoning sinful behavior Perhaps they believed that the best way to help sinners repent was by condemning ridiculing and shaming them When the Savior perceived what the Pharisees and scribes were thinking He told a story What man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it And when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing 2Over the centuries this parable has traditionally been interpreted as a call to action for us to bring back the lost sheep and to reach out to those who are lost While this is certainly appropriate and good I wonder if there is more to it Is it possible that Jesus s purpose first and foremost was to teach about the work of the Good Shepherd Is it possible that He was testifying of God s love for His wayward children Is it possible that the Savior s message was that God is fully aware of those who are lost and that He will find them that He will reach out to them and that He will rescue them If that is so what must the sheep do to qualify for this divine help Does the sheep need to know how to use a complicated sextant to calculate its coordinates Does it need to be able to use a GPS to define its position Does it have to have the expertise to create an app that will call for help Does the sheep need endorsements by a sponsor before the Good Shepherd will come to the rescue No Certainly not The sheep is worthy of divine rescue simply because it is loved by the Good Shepherd To me the parable of the lost sheep is one of the most hopeful passages in all of scripture Our Savior the Good Shepherd knows and loves us He knows and loves you He knows when you are lost and He knows where you are He knows your grief Your silent pleadings Your fears Your tears It matters not how you became lost whether because of your own poor choices or because of circumstances beyond your control What matters is that you are His child And He loves you He loves His children Because He loves you He will find you He will place you upon His shoulders rejoicing And when He brings you home He will say to one and all Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost 3What Must We Do But you might be thinking what is the catch Surely I have to do more than simply wait to be rescued While our loving Father desires that all of His children return to Him He will force no one to heaven 4 God will not rescue us against our will So what must we do His invitation is simple Turn to me 5 Come unto me 6 Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you 7This is how we show Him that we want to be rescued It requires a little faith But do not despair If you cannot muster faith right now begin with hope If you cannot say you know God is there you can hope that He is You can desire to believe 8 That is enough to start Then acting on that hope reach out to Heavenly Father God will extend His love toward you and His work of rescue and transformation will begin Over time you will recognize His hand in your life You will feel His love And the desire to walk in His light and follow His way will grow with every step of faith you take We call these steps of faith obedience That is not a popular word these days But obedience is a cherished concept in the gospel of Jesus Christ because we know that through the Atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel 9As we increase in faith we also must increase in faithfulness Earlier I quoted a German author who lamented the destruction of Dresden He also penned the phrase Es gibt nichts Gutes ausser Man tut es For those who do not speak the celestial language this is translated as There is nothing good unless you do it 10You and I may speak most eloquently of spiritual things We may impress people with our keen intellectual interpretation of religious topics We may rhapsodize about religion and dream of our mansion above 11 But if our faith does not change the way we live if our beliefs do not influence our daily decisions our religion is vain and our faith if not dead is certainly not well and is in danger of eventually flatlining 12Obedience is the lifeblood of faith It is by obedience that we gather light into our souls But sometimes I think we misunderstand obedience We may see obedience as an end in itself rather than a means to an end Or we may pound the metaphorical hammer of obedience against the iron anvil of the commandments in an effort to shape those we love through constant heating and repeated battering into holier heavenly matter No doubt about it there are times when we need a stern call to repentance Certainly there are some who may be reached only in this manner But perhaps there is a different metaphor that can explain why we obey the commandments of God Maybe obedience is not so much the process of bending twisting and pounding our souls into something we are not Instead it is the process by which we discover what we truly are made of We are created by the Almighty God He is our Heavenly Father We are literally His spirit children We are made of supernal material most precious and highly refined and thus we carry within ourselves the substance of divinity Here on earth however our thoughts and actions become encumbered with that which is corrupt unholy and impure The dust and filth of the world stain our souls making it difficult to recognize and remember our birthright and purpose But all this cannot change who we truly are The fundamental divinity of our nature remains And the moment we choose to incline our hearts to our beloved Savior and set foot upon the path of discipleship something miraculous happens The love of God fills our hearts the light of truth fills our minds we start to lose the desire to sin and we do not want to walk any longer in darkness 13We come to see obedience not as a punishment but as a liberating path to our divine destiny And gradually the corruption dust and limitations of this earth begin to fall away Eventually the priceless eternal spirit of the heavenly being within us is revealed and a radiance of goodness becomes our nature You Are Worthy of RescueMy dear brothers and sisters my dear friends I testify that God sees us as we truly are and He sees us worthy of rescue You may feel that your life is in ruins You may have sinned You may be afraid angry grieving or tortured by doubt But just as the Good Shepherd finds His lost sheep if you will only lift up your heart to the Savior of the world He will find you He will rescue you He will lift you up and place you on His shoulders He will carry you home If mortal hands can transform rubble and ruins into a beautiful house of worship then we can have confidence and trust that our loving Heavenly Father can and will rebuild us His plan is to build us into something far greater than what we were far greater than what we can ever imagine With each step of faith on the path of discipleship we grow into the beings of eternal glory and infinite joy we were designed to become This is my testimony my blessing and my humble prayer in the sacred name of our Master in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Babylon and DanielTwenty six hundred years ago Babylon was the world s great superpower One ancient historian described the walls of Babylon that surrounded the city as more than 300 feet 90 m high and 80 feet 25 m thick In magnificence he wrote there is no other city that approaches it 1In its day Babylon was the world s center of learning law and philosophy Its military might was unparalleled It shattered the power of Egypt It invaded torched and looted the Assyrian capital Nineveh It easily conquered Jerusalem and carried away the best and brightest of the children of Israel back to Babylon to serve King Nebuchadnezzar One of these captives was a young man by the name of Daniel Many scholars believe that Daniel was between 12 and 17 years old at the time Think of it my beloved young Aaronic Priesthood holders Daniel was very likely your age when he was taken into the king s court to be educated in the language laws religion and science of the worldly Babylon Can you imagine what it would have felt like to be forced from your home marched 500 miles 800 km to a foreign city and indoctrinated in the religion of your enemies Daniel had been raised as a follower of Jehovah He believed in and worshipped the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob He had studied the words of the prophets and he knew of God s interaction with man But now at a very young age he was a prisoner student in Babylon The pressure on him must have been immense to abandon his old beliefs and adopt those of Babylon But he stayed true to his faith in word and in deed Many of you know how it feels to defend an unpopular truth In the Internet slang of today we talk about getting flamed by those who disagree with us But Daniel wasn t just risking public ridicule In Babylon those who challenged the religious authorities understood what it means figuratively and literally to be flamed Just ask Daniel s friends Shadrach Meshach and Abed nego 2I don t know if it was easy for Daniel to be a believer in such an environment Some people are blessed with a believing heart for them faith seems to come as a gift from heaven But I imagine that Daniel was like many of us who have to work for our testimonies I m confident that Daniel spent many hours on his knees praying laying his questions and fears on the altar of faith and waiting upon the Lord for understanding and wisdom And the Lord did bless Daniel Though his faith was challenged and ridiculed he stayed true to what he knew by his own experience to be right Daniel believed Daniel did not doubt And then one night King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream that troubled his mind He assembled his team of scholars and counselors and demanded that they describe the dream to him and also reveal the meaning of it Of course they could not No one can do what you ask they pleaded But this only made Nebuchadnezzar more furious and he commanded that all the wise men magicians astrologers and counselors be cut in pieces including Daniel and the other young students from Israel You who are familiar with the book of Daniel know what happened next Daniel asked Nebuchadnezzar for a little extra time and he and his faithful companions went to the source of their faith and moral strength They prayed to God and asked for divine help at this crucial moment in their lives And then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision 3Daniel the young boy from a conquered nation who had been bullied and persecuted for believing in his strange religion went before the king and revealed to him the dream and its interpretation From that day on as a direct result of his faithfulness to God Daniel became a trusted counselor to the king renowned for his wisdom in all of Babylon The boy who believed and lived his faith had become a man of God A prophet A prince of righteousness 4Are We like Daniel To all of us who bear the holy priesthood of God I ask are we like Daniel Do we stand loyal to God Do we practice what we preach or are we Sunday Christians only Do our daily actions reflect clearly what we claim to believe Do we help the poor and the needy the sick and the afflicted 5Do we just talk the talk or do we enthusiastically walk the walk Brethren we have been given much We have been taught the divine truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ We have been entrusted with priesthood authority to help our fellowmen and build up God s kingdom on earth We live in a time of great outpouring of spiritual power We have the fulness of truth We have priesthood keys to seal on earth and in heaven Sacred scriptures and teachings of living prophets and apostles are available as never before My dear friends let us not take these things lightly With these blessings and privileges come great responsibilities and obligations Let us rise up to them The ancient city of Babylon is in ruins Its splendor is long gone But Babylon s worldliness and wickedness live on Now it falls to us to live as believers in a world of disbelief The challenge is ours to daily practice the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and to live true to God s commandments We will have to stay calm under peer pressure not be impressed by popular trends or false prophets disregard the ridicule of the ungodly resist the temptations of the evil one and overcome our own laziness Just think about it How much easier would it have been for Daniel to simply go along with the ways of Babylon He could have set aside the restrictive code of conduct God had given the children of Israel He could have feasted on the rich foods provided by the king and indulged in the worldly pleasures of the natural man He would have avoided ridicule He would have been popular He would have fit in His path might have been much less complicated That is of course until the day when the king demanded an interpretation of his dream Then Daniel would have found that he like the rest of Babylon s wise men had lost his connection to the true source of light and wisdom Daniel passed his test Ours still continues The Courage to BelieveSatan our adversary wants us to fail He spreads lies as part of his effort to destroy our belief He slyly suggests that the doubter the skeptic the cynic is sophisticated and intelligent while those who have faith in God and His miracles are naive blind or brainwashed Satan will advocate that it is cool to doubt spiritual gifts and the teachings of true prophets I wish I could help everyone to understand this one simple fact we believe in God because of things we know with our heart and mind not because of things we do not know Our spiritual experiences are sometimes too sacred to explain in worldly terms but that doesn t mean they are not real Heavenly Father has prepared for His children a spiritual feast offering every kind of exquisite food imaginable and yet instead of enjoying these spiritual gifts the cynics content themselves with observing from a distance sipping from their cups of skepticism doubt and disrespect Why would anyone walk through life satisfied with the light from the candle of their own understanding when by reaching out to our Heavenly Father they could experience the bright sun of spiritual knowledge that would expand their minds with wisdom and fill their souls with joy When you and I talk to people about faith and belief don t we often hear I wish I could believe the way you do Implied in such a statement is another of Satan s deceptions that belief is available to some people but not to others There is no magic to belief But wanting to believe is the necessary first step God is no respecter of persons 6 He is your Father He wants to speak to you However it requires a little scientific curiosity it requires an experiment upon the word of God and the exercise of a particle of faith 7 It also takes a little humility And it requires an open heart and an open mind It requires seeking in the full meaning of the word And perhaps hardest of all it requires being patient and waiting upon the Lord If we make no effort to believe we are like the man who unplugs a spotlight and then blames the spotlight for not giving any light Recently I was surprised and saddened to hear of an Aaronic Priesthood bearer who seemed to take pride in the fact that he had distanced himself from God He said If God reveals Himself to me then I will believe Until then I will find the truth relying on my own understanding and intellect to light the way before me I don t know this young man s heart but I couldn t help but feel terribly sorry for him How easily he rejected the gifts the Lord was offering him This young man had unplugged the spotlight and then seemed self satisfied in his clever observation that there was no light Unfortunately this seems to be quite a popular attitude today If we can put the burden of proof on God we think we can excuse ourselves from taking God s commandments seriously and from taking responsibility for our relationship with our Heavenly Father Brethren let me be clear there is nothing noble or impressive about being cynical Skepticism is easy anyone can do it It is the faithful life that requires moral strength dedication and courage Those who hold fast to faith are far more impressive than those who give in to doubt when mysterious questions or concerns arise But it should not surprise us that faith is not valued by society The world has a long history of rejecting that which it does not understand And it has particular trouble understanding things it cannot see But just because we cannot see something with our physical eyes does not mean it doesn t exist Indeed there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our textbooks scientific journals and worldly philosophies 8 The universe is filled with wonders profound and astonishing things that can be comprehended only through spiritual eyes The Promise of BeliefWhen we choose to believe exercise faith unto repentance and follow our Savior Jesus Christ we open our spiritual eyes to splendors we can scarcely imagine Thus our belief and faith will grow stronger and we will see even more 9Brethren I testify that even in the toughest of times the Savior will say to you as He said to an anxious father on a crowded street in Galilee Be not afraid only believe 10We can choose to believe For in belief we discover the dawn of light We will discover truth 11We will find peace 12Because of our belief we will never hunger never thirst 13 The gifts of God s grace will enable us to be true to our faith and will fill our soul like a well of water springing up into everlasting life 14 We will experience true and lasting joy 15Therefore my dear friends my beloved brethren in the priesthood of God Have courage to believe Be not afraid only believe Stand with Daniel I pray that each one of us young and old will find renewed strength courage and desire to believe In the name of our Master Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters my dear friends it is a joy to be with you today We are saddened by the sight of three empty places here on the stand We miss President Packer Elder Perry and Elder Scott We love them and we pray for the well being of their families During this conference weekend we will be privileged to sustain three who have been called by the Lord to take their place among the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Our prayers on their behalf will strengthen them as they bear the sacred mantle of apostleship Is the Gospel Working for You Not long ago I saw a quote that made me stop and think It went like this Tell a man there are trillions of stars in the universe and he ll believe you Tell him there s wet paint on the wall and he ll touch it just to be sure Aren t we all a little bit like this After a recent medical procedure my very capable doctors explained what I needed to do to heal properly But first I had to relearn something about myself I should have known for a long time as a patient I m not very patient Consequently I decided to expedite the healing process by undertaking my own Internet search I suppose I expected to discover truth of which my doctors were unaware or had tried to keep from me It took me a little while before I realized the irony of what I was doing Of course researching things for ourselves is not a bad idea But I was disregarding truth I could rely on and instead found myself being drawn to the often outlandish claims of Internet lore Sometimes the truth may just seem too straightforward too plain and too simple for us to fully appreciate its great value So we set aside what we have experienced and know to be true in pursuit of more mysterious or complicated information Hopefully we will learn that when we chase after shadows we are pursuing matters that have little substance and value When it comes to spiritual truth how can we know that we are on the right path One way is by asking the right questions the kind that help us ponder our progress and evaluate how things are working for us Questions like Does my life have meaning Do I believe in God Do I believe that God knows and loves me Do I believe that God hears and answers my prayers Am I truly happy Are my efforts leading me to the highest spiritual goals and values in life Profound questions regarding the purpose of life have led many individuals and families throughout the world to search for truth Often that search has led them to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and to the restored gospel I wonder if we as Church members might also benefit from asking ourselves from time to time Is my experience in the Church working for me Is it bringing me closer to Christ Is it blessing me and my family with peace and joy as promised in the gospel Alma posed similar questions to Church members in Zarahemla when he asked Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts And can you feel it now 1 Such contemplation may help us to refocus or realign our daily efforts with the divine plan of salvation Many members will answer with great warmth that their experience as a member of the Church is working exceptionally well for them They will testify that whether during times of poverty or prosperity whether things are pleasant or painful they find great meaning peace and joy because of their commitment to the Lord and their dedicated service in the Church Every day I meet Church members who are filled with a radiant joy and who demonstrate in word and deed that their lives are immeasurably enriched by the restored gospel of Jesus Christ But I also recognize that there are some who have a less than fulfilling experience who feel that their membership in the Church sometimes isn t quite what they had hoped for This saddens me because I know firsthand how the gospel can invigorate and renew one s spirit how it can fill our hearts with hope and our minds with light I know for myself how the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ can transform lives from the ordinary and dreary to the extraordinary and sublime But why does it seem to work better for some than for others What is the difference between those whose experience in the Church fills their souls with songs of redeeming love2 and those who feel that something is lacking As I have pondered these questions a flood of thoughts came to mind Today I d like to share two SimplifyFirst are we making our discipleship too complicated This beautiful gospel is so simple a child can grasp it yet so profound and complex that it will take a lifetime even an eternity of study and discovery to fully understand it But sometimes we take the beautiful lily of God s truth and gild it with layer upon layer of man made good ideas programs and expectations Each one by itself might be helpful and appropriate for a certain time and circumstance but when they are laid on top of each other they can create a mountain of sediment that becomes so thick and heavy that we risk losing sight of that precious flower we once loved so dearly Therefore as leaders we must strictly protect the Church and the gospel in its purity and plainness and avoid putting unnecessary burdens on our members And all of us as members of the Church we need to make a conscientious effort to devote our energy and time to the things that truly matter while uplifting our fellowmen and building the kingdom of God One sister a Relief Society instructor was known for preparing flawless lessons One time she decided to create a beautiful quilt that would serve as the perfect backdrop to the theme of her lesson But life intervened there were children to pick up from school a neighbor who needed help moving a husband who had a fever and a friend who felt lonely The day of the lesson approached and the quilt was not completed Finally the night before her lesson she did not sleep much as she worked all night on the quilt The next day she was exhausted and barely able to organize her thoughts but she bravely stood and delivered her lesson And the quilt was stunning the stitches were perfect the colors vibrant and the design intricate And at the center of it all was a single word that triumphantly echoed the theme of her lesson Simplify Brothers and sisters living the gospel doesn t need to be complicated It is really straightforward It could be described like this Hearing the word of God with earnest intent leads us to believe in God and to trust His promises 3The more we trust God the more our hearts are filled with love for Him and for each other Because of our love for God we desire to follow Him and bring our actions in alignment with His word Because we love God we want to serve Him we want to bless the lives of others and help the poor and the needy The more we walk in this path of discipleship the more we desire to learn the word of God And so it goes each step leading to the next and filling us with ever increasing faith hope and charity It is beautifully simple and it works beautifully Brothers and sisters if you ever think that the gospel isn t working so well for you I invite you to step back look at your life from a higher plane and simplify your approach to discipleship Focus on the basic doctrines principles and applications of the gospel I promise that God will guide and bless you on your path to a fulfilling life and the gospel will definitely work better for you Start Where You AreMy second suggestion is start where you are Sometimes we feel discouraged because we are not more of something more spiritual respected intelligent healthy rich friendly or capable Naturally there is nothing wrong with wanting to improve God created us to grow and progress But remember our weaknesses can help us to be humble and turn us to Christ who will make weak things become strong 4 Satan on the other hand uses our weaknesses to the point that we are discouraged from even trying I learned in my life that we don t need to be more of anything to start to become the person God intended us to become God will take you as you are at this very moment and begin to work with you All you need is a willing heart a desire to believe and trust in the Lord Gideon saw himself as a poor farmer the least of his father s house But God saw him as a mighty man of valor 5When Samuel chose Saul to be king Saul tried to talk him out of it Saul was from one of the smallest tribes of the house of Israel How could he be king 6 But God saw him as a choice young man 7Even the great prophet Moses felt so overwhelmed and discouraged at one point that he wanted to give up and die 8 But God did not give up on Moses My dear brothers and sisters if we look at ourselves only through our mortal eyes we may not see ourselves as good enough But our Heavenly Father sees us as who we truly are and who we can become He sees us as His sons and daughters as beings of eternal light with everlasting potential and with a divine destiny 9The Savior s sacrifice opened the door of salvation for all to return to God His grace is sufficient for all who humble themselves before God 10 His grace is the enabling power that allows access into God s kingdoms of salvation Because of His grace we will all be resurrected and saved in a kingdom of glory Even the lowest kingdom of glory the telestial kingdom surpasses all understanding 11 and numberless people will inherit this salvation 12But the Savior s grace can do much more for us As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints we aspire to something unimaginably greater It is exaltation in the celestial kingdom It is life eternal in the presence of our Father in Heaven It is the greatest gift of God 13 In the celestial kingdom we receive of his fulness and of his glory 14 Indeed all that the Father hath shall be given unto us 15Exaltation is our goal discipleship is our journey As you exercise a little faith and begin your walk as a peaceable follower of

My beloved sisters and dear friends I am delighted to be with you today and I am grateful to be in the presence of our dear prophet President Thomas S Monson President we love you We are saddened by the loss of our three precious friends and true Apostles of the Lord We miss President Packer Elder Perry and Elder Scott we love them We pray for their families and friends I always look forward to this session of conference the beautiful music and the counsel from our inspired sisters bring the Spirit in great abundance I am a better person after being in your company As I pondered what I should say to you today my thoughts turned to the way the Savior taught It is interesting how He was able to teach the most sublime truths using simple stories His parables invited His disciples to embrace truths not just with their minds but also with their hearts and to connect eternal principles with their everyday lives 1 Our dear President Monson is also a master at teaching with personal experiences that touch the heart 2Today I too will give my message by expressing my thoughts and feelings in the form of a story I invite you to listen with the Spirit The Holy Ghost will help you to find the message for you in this parable Great Aunt RoseThe story is about a girl named Eva There are two important things you should know about Eva One is that she was 11 years old in this story And the other is that she absolutely positively did not want to go and live with her great aunt Rose Not at all No way But Eva s mother was going to have surgery that required a lengthy recovery So Eva s parents were sending her to spend the summer with Great Aunt Rose In Eva s mind there were a thousand reasons why this was a bad idea For one thing it would mean being away from her mother It would also mean leaving her family and friends And besides she didn t even know Great Aunt Rose She was quite comfortable thank you very much right where she was But no amount of arguing or eye rolling could change the decision So Eva packed up a suitcase and took the long drive with her father to Great Aunt Rose s house From the moment Eva stepped inside the house she hated it Everything was so old Every inch was packed with old books strange colored bottles and plastic bins spilling over with beads bows and buttons Great Aunt Rose lived there alone she had never married The only other inhabitant was a gray cat who liked to find the highest point in every room and perch there staring like a hungry tiger at everything below Even the house itself seemed lonely It was out in the countryside where the houses are far apart No one Eva s age lived within half a mile That made Eva feel lonely too At first she didn t pay much attention to Great Aunt Rose She mostly thought about her mother Sometimes she would stay awake at night praying with all her soul that her mother would be well And though it didn t happen right away Eva began to feel that God was watching over her mother Word finally came that the operation was a success and now all that was left for Eva to do was to endure till the end of summer But oh how she hated enduring With her mind now at ease about her mother Eva began to notice Great Aunt Rose a little more She was a large woman everything about her was large her voice her smile her personality It wasn t easy for her to get around but she always sang and laughed while she worked and the sound of her laughter filled the house Every night she sat down on her overstuffed sofa pulled out her scriptures and read out loud And as she read she sometimes made comments like Oh he shouldn t have done that or What wouldn t I give to have been there or Isn t that the most beautiful thing you ve ever heard And every evening as the two of them knelt by Eva s bed to pray Great Aunt Rose would say the most beautiful prayers thanking her Heavenly Father for the blue jays and the spruce trees the sunsets and the stars and the wonder of being alive It sounded to Eva as though Rose knew God as a friend Over time Eva made a surprising discovery Great Aunt Rose was quite possibly the happiest person she had ever known But how could that be What did she have to be happy about She had never married she had no children she had no one to keep her company except that creepy cat and she had a hard time doing simple things like tying her shoes and walking up stairs When she went to town she wore embarrassingly big bright hats But people didn t laugh at her Instead they crowded around her wanting to talk to her Rose had been a schoolteacher and it wasn t uncommon for former students now grown up with children of their own to stop and chat They thanked her for being a good influence in their lives They often laughed Sometimes they even cried As the summer progressed Eva spent more and more time with Rose They went on long walks and Eva learned the difference between sparrows and finches She picked wild elderberries and made marmalade from oranges She learned about her great great grandmother who left her beloved homeland sailed across an ocean and walked across the plains to be with the Saints Soon Eva made another startling discovery not only was Great Aunt Rose one of the happiest persons she knew but Eva herself was happier whenever she was around her The days of summer were passing more quickly now Before Eva knew it Great Aunt Rose said it would soon be time for Eva to return home Though Eva had been looking forward to that moment since the day she arrived she wasn t quite sure how to feel about it now She realized she was actually going to miss this strange old house with the stalker cat and her beloved great aunt Rose The day before her father arrived to pick her up Eva asked the question she had been wondering about for weeks Aunt Rose why are you so happy Aunt Rose looked at her carefully and then guided her to a painting that hung in the front room It had been a gift from a talented dear friend What do you see there she asked Eva had noticed the painting before but she hadn t really looked at it closely A girl in pioneer dress skipped along a bright blue path The grass and trees were a vibrant green Eva said It s a painting of a girl Looks like she s skipping Yes it is a pioneer girl skipping along happily Aunt Rose said I imagine there were many dark and dreary days for the pioneers Their life was so hard we can t even imagine But in this painting everything is bright and hopeful This girl has a spring in her step and she is moving forward and upward Eva was silent so Great Aunt Rose continued There is enough that doesn t go right in life so anyone can work themselves into a puddle of pessimism and a mess of melancholy But I know people who even when things don t work out focus on the wonders and miracles of life These folks are the happiest people I know But Eva said you can t just flip a switch and go from sad to happy No perhaps not Aunt Rose smiled gently but God didn t design us to be sad He created us to have joy 3 So if we trust Him He will help us to notice the good bright hopeful things of life And sure enough the world will become brighter No it doesn t happen instantly but honestly how many good things do Seems to me that the best things like homemade bread or orange marmalade take patience and work Eva thought about it a moment and said Maybe it s not so simple for people who don t have everything perfect in their lives Dear Eva do you really think that my life is perfect Aunt Rose sat with Eva on the overstuffed sofa There was a time when I was so discouraged I didn t want to go on You Eva asked Aunt Rose nodded There were so many things I wished for in my life As she spoke a sadness entered her voice that Eva had never heard before Most of them never happened It was one heartbreak after another One day I realized that it would never be the way I had hoped for That was a depressing day I was ready to give up and be miserable So what did you do Nothing for a time I was just angry I was an absolute monster to be around Then she laughed a little but it was not her usual big room filling laugh It s not fair was the song I sang over and over in my head But eventually I discovered something that turned my whole life around What was it Faith Aunt Rose smiled I discovered faith And faith led to hope And faith and hope gave me confidence that one day everything would make sense that because of the Savior all the wrongs would be made right After that I saw that the path before me wasn t as dreary and dusty as I had thought I began to notice the bright blues the verdant greens and the fiery reds and I decided I had a choice I could hang my head and drag my feet on the dusty road of self pity or I could have a little faith put on a bright dress slip on my dancing shoes and skip down the path of life singing as I went Now her voice was skipping along like the girl in the painting Aunt Rose reached over to the end table and pulled her well worn scriptures onto her lap I don t think I was clinically depressed I m not sure you can talk yourself out of that But I sure had talked myself into being miserable Yes I had some dark days but all my brooding and worrying wasn t going to change that it was only making things worse Faith in the Savior taught me that no matter what happened in the past my story could have a happy ending How do you know that Eva asked Aunt Rose turned a page in her Bible and said It says it right here God will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away 4Great Aunt Rose looked at Eva Her smile was wide as she whispered with a slight quiver in her voice Isn t that the most beautiful thing you ve ever heard It really did sound beautiful Eva thought Aunt Rose turned a few pages and pointed to a verse for Eva to read Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 5 With such a glorious future Aunt Rose said why get swallowed up in past or present things that don t go quite the way we planned Eva furrowed her brow But wait a minute she said Are you saying that being happy means just looking forward to happiness in the future Is all our happiness in eternity Can t some of it happen now Oh of course it can Aunt Rose exclaimed Dear child now is part of eternity It doesn t only begin after we die Faith and hope will open your eyes to the happiness that is placed before you I know a poem that says Forever is composed of Nows 6 I didn t want my forever to be composed of dark and fearful Nows And I didn t want to live in the gloom of a bunker gritting my teeth closing my eyes and resentfully enduring to the bitter end Faith gave me the hope I needed to live joyfully now So what did you do then Eva asked I exercised faith in God s promises by filling my life with meaningful things I went to school I got an education That led me to a career that I loved Eva thought about this for a moment and said But surely being busy isn t what made you happy There are a lot of busy people who aren t happy How can you be so wise for someone so young Aunt Rose asked You re absolutely right And most of those busy unhappy people have forgotten the one thing that matters most in all the world the thing Jesus said is the heart of His gospel And what is that Eva asked It is love the pure love of Christ Rose said You see everything else in the gospel all the shoulds and the musts and the thou shalts lead to love When we love God we want to serve Him We want to be like Him When we love our neighbors we stop thinking so much about our own problems and help others to solve theirs 7 And that is what makes us happy Eva asked Great Aunt Rose nodded and smiled her eyes filling with tears Yes my dear That is what makes us happy Never the SameThe next day Eva hugged her great aunt Rose and thanked her for everything she had done She returned home to her family and her friends and her house and her neighborhood But she was never quite the same As Eva grew older she often thought of the words of her great aunt Rose Eva eventually married raised children and lived a long and wonderful life And one day as she was standing in her own home admiring a painting of a girl in pioneer dress skipping down a bright blue path she realized that somehow she had reached the same age her great aunt Rose was during that remarkable summer When she realized this she felt a special prayer swell within her heart And Eva felt grateful for her life for her family for the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and for that summer so long ago when Great Aunt Rose8 taught her about faith hope and love 9A BlessingMy beloved sisters my dear friends in Christ I hope and pray that something in this story has touched your heart and inspired your soul I know that God lives and that He loves each and every one of you As you walk along your own bright path of discipleship I pray that faith will fortify every footstep along your way that hope will open your eyes to the glories Heavenly Father has in store for you and that love for God and all His children will fill your hearts As an Apostle of the Lord I leave this as my testimony and blessing in the name of Jesus Christ amen

On Easter Sunday we celebrate the most long awaited and glorious event in the history of the world It is the day that changed everything On that day my life changed Your life changed The destiny of all God s children changed On that blessed day the Savior of mankind who had taken upon Himself the chains of sin and death that held us captive burst those chains and set us free Because of the sacrifice of our beloved Redeemer death has no sting the grave has no victory 1 Satan has no lasting power and we are begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ 2Truly the Apostle Paul was correct when he said we can comfort one another with these words 3God s GraceWe often speak of the Savior s Atonement and rightly so In Jacob s words Why not speak of the atonement of Christ and attain to a perfect knowledge of him 4 But as we talk of Christ rejoice in Christ preach of Christ and prophesy of Christ 5 at every opportunity we must never lose our sense of awe and profound gratitude for the eternal sacrifice of the Son of God The Savior s Atonement cannot become commonplace in our teaching in our conversation or in our hearts It is sacred and holy for it was through this great and last sacrifice that Jesus the Christ brought salvation to all those who shall believe on his name 6I marvel to think that the Son of God would condescend to save us as imperfect impure mistake prone and ungrateful as we often are I have tried to understand the Savior s Atonement with my finite mind and the only explanation I can come up with is this God loves us deeply perfectly and everlastingly I cannot even begin to estimate the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ 7A powerful expression of that love is what the scriptures often call the grace of God the divine assistance and endowment of strength by which we grow from the flawed and limited beings we are now into exalted beings of truth and light until we are glorified in truth and know all things 8It is a most wondrous thing this grace of God Yet it is often misunderstood 9 Even so we should know about God s grace if we intend to inherit what has been prepared for us in His eternal kingdom To that end I would like to speak of grace In particular first how grace unlocks the gates of heaven and second how it opens the windows of heaven First Grace Unlocks the Gates of HeavenBecause we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God 10 and because there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God 11 every one of us is unworthy to return to God s presence Even if we were to serve God with our whole souls it is not enough for we would still be unprofitable servants 12 We cannot earn our way into heaven the demands of justice stand as a barrier which we are powerless to overcome on our own But all is not lost The grace of God is our great and everlasting hope Through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ the plan of mercy appeases the demands of justice13 and brings about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance 14Our sins though they may be as scarlet can become white as snow 15 Because our beloved Savior gave himself a ransom for all 16 an entrance into His everlasting kingdom is provided unto us 17The gate is unlocked But the grace of God does not merely restore us to our previous innocent state If salvation means only erasing our mistakes and sins then salvation as wonderful as it is does not fulfill the Father s aspirations for us His aim is much higher He wants His sons and daughters to become like Him With the gift of God s grace the path of discipleship does not lead backward it leads upward It leads to heights we can scarcely comprehend It leads to exaltation in the celestial kingdom of our Heavenly Father where we surrounded by our loved ones receive of his fulness and of his glory 18 All things are ours and we are Christ s 19 Indeed all that the Father hath shall be given unto us 20To inherit this glory we need more than an unlocked gate we must enter through this gate with a heart s desire to be changed a change so dramatic that the scriptures describe it as being born again yea born of God changed from our worldly and fallen state to a state of righteousness being redeemed of God becoming his sons and daughters 21Second Grace Opens the Windows of HeavenAnother element of God s grace is the opening of the windows of heaven through which God pours out blessings of power and strength enabling us to achieve things that otherwise would be far beyond our reach It is by God s amazing grace that His children can overcome the undercurrents and quicksands of the deceiver rise above sin and be perfect ed in Christ 22Though we all have weaknesses we can overcome them Indeed it is by the grace of God that if we humble ourselves and have faith weak things can become strong 23Throughout our lives God s grace bestows temporal blessings and spiritual gifts that magnify our abilities and enrich our lives His grace refines us His grace helps us become our best selves Who Can Qualify In the Bible we read of Christ s visit to the home of Simon the Pharisee Outwardly Simon seemed to be a good and upright man He regularly checked off his to do list of religious obligations he kept the law paid his tithing observed the Sabbath prayed daily and went to the synagogue But while Jesus was with Simon a woman approached washed the Savior s feet with her tears and anointed His feet with fine oil Simon was not pleased with this display of worship for he knew that this woman was a sinner Simon thought that if Jesus didn t know this He must not be a prophet or He would not have let the woman touch him Perceiving his thoughts Jesus turned to Simon and asked a question There was a certain creditor which had two debtors one owed five hundred pence the other fifty And when they both had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both Tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered that it was the one who was forgiven the most Then Jesus taught a profound lesson Seest thou this woman Her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little 24Which of these two people are we most like Are we like Simon Are we confident and comfortable in our good deeds trusting in our own righteousness Are we perhaps a little impatient with those who are not living up to our standards Are we on autopilot going through the motions attending our meetings yawning through Gospel Doctrine class and perhaps checking our cell phones during sacrament service Or are we like this woman who thought she was completely and hopelessly lost because of sin Do we love much Do we understand our indebtedness to Heavenly Father and plead with all our souls for the grace of God When we kneel to pray is it to replay the greatest hits of our own righteousness or is it to confess our faults plead for God s mercy and shed tears of gratitude for the amazing plan of redemption 25Salvation cannot be bought with the currency of obedience it is purchased by the blood of the Son of God 26 Thinking that we can trade our good works for salvation is like buying a plane ticket and then supposing we own the airline Or thinking that after paying rent for our home we now hold title to the entire planet earth Why Then Obey If grace is a gift of God why then is obedience to God s commandments so important Why bother with God s commandments or repentance for that matter Why not just admit we re sinful and let God save us Or to put the question in Paul s words Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound Paul s answer is simple and clear God forbid 27Brothers and sisters we obey the commandments of God out of love for Him Trying to understand God s gift of grace with all our heart and mind gives us all the more reasons to love and obey our Heavenly Father with meekness and gratitude As we walk the path of discipleship it refines us it improves us it helps us to become more like Him and it leads us back to His presence The Spirit of the Lord our God brings about such a mighty change in us that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually 28Therefore our obedience to God s commandments comes as a natural outgrowth of our endless love and gratitude for the goodness of God This form of genuine love and gratitude will miraculously merge our works with God s grace Virtue will garnish our thoughts unceasingly and our confidence will wax strong in the presence of God 29Dear brothers and sisters living the gospel faithfully is not a burden It is a joyful rehearsal a preparation for inheriting the grand glory of the eternities We seek to obey our Heavenly Father because our spirits will become more attuned to spiritual things Vistas are opened that we never knew existed Enlightenment and understanding come to us when we do the will of the Father 30Grace is a gift of God and our desire to be obedient to each of God s commandments is the reaching out of our mortal hand to receive this sacred gift from our Heavenly Father All We Can DoThe prophet Nephi made an important contribution to our understanding of God s grace when he declared We labor diligently to persuade our children and also our brethren to believe in Christ and to be reconciled to God for we know that it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do 31However I wonder if sometimes we misinterpret the phrase after all we can do We must understand that after does not equal because We are not saved because of all that we can do Have any of us done all that we can do Does God wait until we ve expended every effort before He will intervene in our lives with His saving grace Many people feel discouraged because they constantly fall short They know firsthand that the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak 32 They raise their voices with Nephi in proclaiming My soul grieveth because of mine iniquities 33I am certain Nephi knew that the Savior s grace allows and enables us to overcome sin 34 This is why Nephi labored so diligently to persuade his children and brethren to believe in Christ and to be reconciled to God 35After all that is what we can do And that is our task in mortality Grace Is Available to AllWhen I think of what the Savior did for us leading up to that first Easter Sunday I want to lift up my voice and shout praises to the Most High God and His Son Jesus Christ The gates of heaven are unlocked The windows of heaven are opened Today and forevermore God s grace is available to all whose hearts are broken and whose spirits are contrite 36 Jesus Christ has cleared the way for us to ascend to heights incomprehensible to mortal minds 37I pray that we will see with new eyes and a new heart the eternal significance of the Savior s atoning sacrifice I pray that we will show our love for God and our gratitude for the gift of God s infinite grace by keeping His commandments and joyfully walk ing in a newness of life 38 In the sacred name of our Master and Redeemer Jesus Christ amen 
In the late 18th century Catherine the Great of Russia announced she would tour the southern part of her empire accompanied by several foreign ambassadors The governor of the area Grigory Potemkin desperately wanted to impress these visitors And so he went to remarkable lengths to showcase the country s accomplishments For part of the journey Catherine floated down the Dnieper River proudly pointing out to the ambassadors the thriving hamlets along the shore filled with industrious and happy townspeople There was only one problem it was all for show It is said that Potemkin had assembled pasteboard facades of shops and homes He had even positioned busy looking peasants to create the impression of a prosperous economy Once the party disappeared around the bend of the river Potemkin s men packed up the fake village and rushed it downstream in preparation for Catherine s next pass Although modern historians have questioned the truthfulness of this story the term Potemkin village has entered the world s vocabulary It now refers to any attempt to make others believe we are better than we really are Are Our Hearts in the Right Place It is part of human nature to want to look our best It is why many of us work so hard on the exterior of our homes and why our young Aaronic Priesthood brethren make sure every hair is in place just in case they run into that special someone There is nothing wrong with shining our shoes smelling our best or even hiding the dirty dishes before the home teachers arrive However when taken to extremes this desire to impress can shift from useful to deceitful The Lord s prophets have ever raised a warning voice against those who draw near to the Lord with their mouth and with their lips do honour Him but have removed their heart far from Him 1The Savior was understanding and compassionate with sinners whose hearts were humble and sincere But He rose up in righteous anger against hypocrites like the scribes Pharisees and Sadducees those who tried to appear righteous in order to win the praise influence and wealth of the world all the while oppressing the people they should have been blessing The Savior compared them to whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men s bones and of all uncleanness 2In our day the Lord has similarly strong words for priesthood holders who try to cover their sins or to gratify their pride or their vain ambition When they do this He said the heavens withdraw themselves the Spirit of the Lord is grieved and when it is withdrawn Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man 3Why does this happen Why do we sometimes try to appear active prosperous and dedicated outwardly when on the inside as the Revelator said of the Ephesians we have left our first love 4In some cases we may simply have lost our focus on the essence of the gospel mistaking the form of godliness for the power thereof 5 This is especially dangerous when we direct our outward expressions of discipleship to impress others for personal gain or influence It is then that we are at risk of entering into Pharisee territory and it is high time to examine our hearts to make immediate course corrections Potemkin ProgramsThis temptation to appear better than we are is found not just in our personal lives but can be found in our Church assignments as well For example I know of a stake where the leaders set some ambitious goals for the year While the goals all looked worthwhile they focused either on lofty and impressive declarations or on numbers and percentages After these goals had been discussed and agreed upon something began to trouble the stake president He thought about the members of his stake like the young mother with small children who was recently widowed He thought about the members who were struggling with doubts or loneliness or with severe health conditions and no insurance He thought about the members who were grappling with broken marriages addictions unemployment and mental illness And the more he thought about them the more he asked himself a humbling question will our new goals make a difference in the lives of these members He began to wonder how their stake s goals might have been different if they had first asked What is our ministry So this stake president went back to his councils and together they shifted their focus They determined that they would not allow the hungry the needy the naked the sick and the afflicted to pass by them and notice them not 6They set new goals recognizing that success with these new goals could not always be measured at least not by man for how does one measure personal testimony love of God or compassion for others But they also knew that many of the things you can count do not count Many of the things you cannot count really do count 7I wonder if our organizational and personal goals are sometimes the modern equivalent of a Potemkin village Do they look impressive from a distance but fail to address the real needs of our beloved fellowmen My dear friends and fellow priesthood holders if Jesus Christ were to sit down with us and ask for an accounting of our stewardship I am not sure He would focus much on programs and statistics What the Savior would want to know is the condition of our heart He would want to know how we love and minister to those in our care how we show our love to our spouse and family and how we lighten their daily load And the Savior would want to know how you and I grow closer to Him and to our Heavenly Father Why Are We Here It may be beneficial to search our own hearts For example we might ask ourselves why do we serve in the Church of Jesus Christ We could even ask why are we here at this meeting today I suppose if I were to answer that question on a superficial level I could say that I m here because President Monson assigned me to speak So I really didn t have a choice Besides that my wife whom I love very much expects me to attend And how can I say no to her But we all know there are better reasons for attending our meetings and living our lives as committed disciples of Jesus Christ I am here because I desire with all my heart to follow my Master Jesus Christ I yearn to do all that He asks of me in this great cause I hunger to be edified by the Holy Spirit and hear the voice of God as He speaks through His ordained servants I am here to become a better man to be lifted by the inspiring examples of my brothers and sisters in Christ and to learn how to more effectively minister to those in need In short I am here because I love my Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ I am sure this is your reason too This is why we are willing to make sacrifices and not just declarations to follow the Savior This is why we bear with honor His holy priesthood From Spark to BonfireWhether your testimony is thriving and healthy or your activity in the Church more closely resembles a Potemkin village the good news is that you can build on whatever strength you have Here in the Church of Jesus Christ you can mature spiritually and draw closer to the Savior by applying gospel principles day by day With patience and persistence even the smallest act of discipleship or the tiniest ember of belief can become a blazing bonfire of a consecrated life In fact that s how most bonfires begin as a simple spark So if you feel small and weak please simply come unto Christ who makes weak things strong 8 The weakest among us through God s grace can become spiritually strong because God is no respecter of persons 9 He is our faithful God which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments 10It is my conviction that if God can reach out and sustain a poor German refugee from a modest family in a war torn country half a world away from the headquarters of the Church then He can reach out to you My beloved brothers in Christ the God of Creation who breathed life into the universe surely has the power to breathe life into you Surely He can make of you the genuine spiritual being of light and truth you desire to be God s promises are sure and certain We can be forgiven of our sins and cleansed from all unrighteousness 11 And if we continue to embrace and live true principles in our personal circumstances and in our families we will ultimately arrive at a point where we hunger no more neither thirst any more For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed us and shall lead us unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes 12The Church Is a Place of Healing Not HidingBut this cannot happen if we hide behind personal dogmatic or organizational facades Such artificial discipleship not only keeps us from seeing ourselves as who we really are but it also prevents us from truly changing through the miracle of the Savior s Atonement The Church is not an automobile showroom a place to put ourselves on display so that others can admire our spirituality capacity or prosperity It is more like a service center where vehicles in need of repair come for maintenance and rehabilitation And are we not all of us in need of repair maintenance and rehabilitation We come to church not to hide our problems but to heal them And as priesthood holders we have an additional responsibility to feed the flock of God not by constraint but willingly not for personal gain but of a ready mind neither as being lords over God s heritage but being ex amples to the flock 13Remember brethren God resist s the proud but give s grace unto the humble 14The greatest most capable most accomplished man who ever walked this earth was also the most humble He performed some of His most impressive service in private moments with only a few observers whom He asked to tell no man what He had done 15 When someone called Him good He quickly deflected the compliment insisting that only God is truly good 16 Clearly the praise of the world meant nothing to Him His single purpose was to serve His Father and do always those things that please him 17 We would do well to follow the example of our Master May We Love as He LovedBrethren this is our high and holy calling to be agents of Jesus Christ to love as He loved to serve as He served to lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 18 to look after the poor and the needy 19 and to care for the widows and orphans 20I pray brethren that as we serve in our families quorums wards stakes communities and nations we will resist the temptation to draw attention to ourselves and instead strive for a far greater honor to become humble genuine disciples of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ As we do so we will find ourselves walking the path that leads to our best most genuine and noblest selves Of this I testify in the name of our Master Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved sisters my dear friends and blessed disciples of Jesus Christ I am honored to have this opportunity to be with you as we open another general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints In the coming week the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles will meet with all the General Authorities and general auxiliary leaders and the remaining sessions of our worldwide general conference will follow on the coming Saturday and Sunday I am most grateful to President Thomas S Monson the prophet of God for our days for asking me to represent the First Presidency as I speak to the sisters of the Church As I contemplated what I might say my thoughts went back to the women who have shaped my life and helped me through the challenges of mortality I am grateful for my grandmother who decades ago decided to take her family to a Mormon sacrament meeting I am grateful for Sister Ewig an elderly single German lady whose name translates into English as Sister Eternal She was the one who extended this courageous and wonderful invitation to my grandmother I am so very grateful for my mother who led four children through the turmoil of World War II I think also of my daughter granddaughters and future generations of faithful women who will one day follow And of course I am eternally grateful to my wife Harriet who enchanted me as a teen bore the heaviest burdens of our young family as a mother stands with me as a wife and loves and cherishes our children grandchildren and great grandchildren She has been the strength in our home during both good times and bad She brings sunshine into the lives of all who know her Finally I am very grateful to all of you the millions of faithful sisters worldwide of any age who do so much to build the kingdom of God I am grateful to you for the countless ways you inspire nurture and bless those around you Daughters of GodI am pleased to be among so many daughters of God When we sing the song I Am a Child of God the lyrics penetrate our hearts Pondering this truth that we are children of heavenly parents1 fills us with a sense of origin purpose and destiny It is good to remember that you are always a child of God This knowledge will carry you through the most difficult times in your life and will inspire you to accomplish remarkable things However it is also important to remember that being a daughter of eternal parents is not a distinction you earned or you will ever lose You will always and forever remain a daughter of God Your Heavenly Father has high aspirations for you but your divine origin alone does not guarantee you a divine inheritance God sent you here to prepare for a future greater than anything you can imagine The promised blessings of God to the faithful are glorious and inspiring Among them are thrones kingdoms principalities and powers dominions all heights and depths 2 And it takes more than a spiritual birth certificate or a Child of God Membership Card to qualify for these incomprehensible blessings But how do we attain them The Savior has answered this question in our time Except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory For strait is the gate and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation Receive ye therefore my law 3For this reason we speak of walking the path of discipleship We speak of obedience to God s commandments We speak of living the gospel joyfully with all our heart might mind and soul God Knows Something We Don tAnd yet for some of us obedience to God s commandments doesn t always feel very joyful Let s face it there may be some that seem harder or less appealing commandments that we approach with the enthusiasm of a child sitting before a plate of healthy but hated vegetables We grit our teeth and force ourselves to comply so that we can move on to more desirable activities Perhaps during times such as these we might find ourselves asking Do we really need to obey all of God s commandments My response to this question is simple I think God knows something we don t things that are beyond our capacity to comprehend Our Father in Heaven is an eternal being whose experience wisdom and intelligence are infinitely greater than ours 4 Not only that but He is also eternally loving compassionate and focused on one blessed goal to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life 5In other words He not only knows what is best for you He also anxiously wants you to choose what is best for you If you believe this in your hearts if you truly believe the great mission of our Heavenly Father is to exalt and glorify His children and that He knows best how to do it doesn t it make sense to embrace and follow His commandments even the ones that appear difficult Should we not cherish the light posts He has given that guide us through the darkness and the trials of mortality They mark the way back to our heavenly home By choosing Heavenly Father s path you lay a divine foundation for your personal progress as a daughter of God that will bless you throughout your life Part of our challenge is I think that we imagine that God has all of His blessings locked in a huge cloud up in heaven refusing to give them to us unless we comply with some strict paternalistic requirements He has set up But the commandments aren t like that at all In reality Heavenly Father is constantly raining blessings upon us It is our fear doubt and sin that like an umbrella block these blessings from reaching us His commandments are the loving instructions and the divine help for us to close the umbrella so we can receive the shower of heavenly blessings We need to accept that the commandments of God aren t just a long list of good ideas They aren t life hacks from an Internet blog or motivational quotes from a Pinterest board They are divine counsel based on eternal truths given to bring peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come 6So we have a choice On the one hand there is the opinion of the world with its ever changing theories and questionable motives On the other hand there is God s word to His children His eternal wisdom His certain promises and His loving instructions for returning to His presence in glory love and majesty The choice is yours The Creator of the seas sands and endless stars is reaching out to you this very day He is offering the grand recipe for happiness peace and eternal life To qualify for these glorious blessings you must humble yourself exercise faith take upon you the name of Christ seek Him in word and deed and resolutely stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places 7The Why of ObedienceOnce you understand the true nature of God and His commandments you will also better understand yourselves and the divine purpose of your existence With this your motivation for following the commandments changes and it becomes your heart s desire to live the gospel joyfully For example those who see attendance at Church meetings as a personal way to increase their love of God find peace uplift others seek the Spirit and renew their commitment to follow Jesus Christ will find a far richer experience than those who simply put in their time sitting in a pew Sisters it is very important that we attend our Sunday meetings but I m fairly certain our Heavenly Father is even more concerned about our faith and repentance than about attendance statistics Here is another example A single mother of two small children recently came down with chicken pox Of course it wasn t long before her children got sick as well The task of caring for herself and her little ones alone was almost too much for the young mother And as a result the normally spotless house became cluttered and messy Dirty dishes piled up in the sink and laundry piled up everywhere else While she was struggling with crying children and wanting to cry herself a knock came at the door It was her visiting teachers They could see the young mother s distress They could see her house her kitchen They could hear the cries of the children Now if these sisters had been concerned only with completing their assigned monthly visits they might have handed the mother a plate of cookies mentioned that they had missed her at Relief Society last week and said something like Let us know if there is anything we can do Then they would have cheerfully been on their way thankful that they had 100 percent for another month Fortunately these sisters were true disciples of Christ They noticed their sister s needs and put their many talents and their experience to work They cleared up the chaos brought light and clarity into the home and called a friend to bring over some much needed groceries When they at last finished their work and said their good byes they left that young mother in tears tears of gratitude and love From that moment on the young mother s opinion of visiting teaching changed I know she said that I am not just a check mark on someone else s to do list Yes visiting teachers need to be faithful in making their monthly visits all without missing the most important why behind this commandment to love God and fellowmen When we treat God s commandments and our part in building His kingdom like something to check off on a to do list we miss the heart of discipleship We miss the growth that comes from joyfully living the commandments of our Father in Heaven Walking in the path of discipleship does not need to be a bitter experience It is sweet above all that is sweet 8 It is not a burden that weighs us down Discipleship lifts our spirits and lightens our hearts It inspires us with faith hope and charity It fills our spirits with light in times of darkness and serenity during times of sorrow It gives us divine power and lasting joy Living the Gospel JoyfulMy dear sisters in the gospel whether you are 8 or 108 there is one thing that I hope you truly understand and know You are loved You are dear to your heavenly parents The infinite and eternal Creator of light and life knows you He is mindful of you Yes God loves you this very day and always He is not waiting to love you until you have overcome your weaknesses and bad habits He loves you today with a full understanding of your struggles He is aware that you reach up to Him in heartfelt and hopeful prayer He knows of the times you have held onto the fading light and believed even in the midst of growing darkness He knows of your sufferings He knows of your remorse for the times you have fallen short or failed And still He loves you And God knows of your successes though they may seem small to you He acknowledges and cherishes each one of them He loves you for extending yourself to others He loves you for reaching out and helping others bear their heavy burdens even when you are struggling with your own He knows everything about you He sees you clearly He knows you as you really are And He loves you today and always Do you suppose it matters to our Heavenly Father whether your makeup clothes hair and nails are perfect Do you think your value to Him changes based on how many followers you have on Instagram or Pinterest Do you think He wants you to worry or get depressed if some un friend or un follow you on Facebook or Twitter Do you think outward attractiveness your dress size or popularity make the slightest difference in your worth to the One who created the universe He loves you not only for who you are this very day but also for the person of glory and light you have the potential and the desire to become More than you could ever imagine He wants you to achieve your destiny to return to your heavenly home in honor I testify that the way to accomplish this is to place selfish desires and unworthy ambitions on the altar of sacrifice and service Sisters trust in the saving power of Jesus Christ keep His laws and commandments In other words live the gospel joyful It is my prayer that you will experience a renewed and an expanded measure of the beautiful love of God in your lives that you will find the faith determination and commitment to learn God s commandments treasure them in your hearts and live the gospel joyful I promise that as you do so you will discover your best self your real self You will discover what it truly means to be a daughter of the everlasting God the Lord of all righteousness Of this I testify and leave you my blessing as an Apostle of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
It was our beloved Savior s final night in mortality the evening before He would offer Himself a ransom for all mankind As He broke bread with His disciples He said something that must have filled their hearts with great alarm and deep sadness One of you shall betray me He told them The disciples didn t question the truth of what He said Nor did they look around point to someone else and ask Is it him Instead they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him Lord is it I 1I wonder what each of us would do if we were asked that question by the Savior Would we look at those around us and say in our hearts He s probably talking about Brother Johnson I ve always wondered about him or I m glad Brother Brown is here He really needs to hear this message Or would we like those disciples of old look inward and ask that penetrating question Is it I In these simple words Lord is it I lies the beginning of wisdom and the pathway to personal conversion and lasting change A Parable of DandelionsOnce there was a man who enjoyed taking evening walks around his neighborhood He particularly looked forward to walking past his neighbor s house This neighbor kept his lawn perfectly manicured flowers always in bloom the trees healthy and shady It was obvious that the neighbor made every effort to have a beautiful lawn But one day as the man was walking past his neighbor s house he noticed in the middle of this beautiful lawn a single enormous yellow dandelion weed It looked so out of place that it surprised him Why didn t his neighbor pull it out Couldn t he see it Didn t he know that the dandelion could cast seeds that could give root to dozens of additional weeds This solitary dandelion bothered him beyond description and he wanted to do something about it Should he just pluck it out Or spray it with weed killer Perhaps if he went under cover of night he could remove it secretly These thoughts totally occupied his mind as he walked toward his own home He entered his house without even glancing at his own front yard which was blanketed with hundreds of yellow dandelions Beams and MotesDoes this story remind us of the words of the Savior Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother s eye 2This business of beams and motes seems to be closely related to our inability to see ourselves clearly I m not sure why we are able to diagnose and recommend remedies for other people s ills so well while we often have difficulty seeing our own Some years ago there was a news story about a man who believed that if he rubbed lemon juice on his face it would make him invisible to cameras So he put lemon juice all over his face went out and robbed two banks Not much later he was arrested when his image was broadcast over the evening news When police showed the man the videos of himself from the security cameras he couldn t believe his eyes But I had lemon juice on my face he protested 3When a scientist at Cornell University heard about this story he was intrigued that a man could be so painfully unaware of his own incompetence To determine whether this was a general problem two researchers invited college students to participate in a series of tests on various life skills and then asked them to rate how they did The students who performed poorly were the least accurate at evaluating their own performance some of them estimating their scores to be five times higher than they actually were 4This study has been replicated in numerous ways confirming over and over again the same conclusion many of us have a difficult time seeing ourselves as we truly are and even successful people overestimate their own contribution and underestimate the contributions that others make 5It might not be so significant to overestimate how well we drive a car or how far we can drive a golf ball But when we start believing that our contributions at home at work and at church are greater than they actually are we blind ourselves to blessings and opportunities to improve ourselves in significant and profound ways Spiritual Blind SpotsAn acquaintance of mine used to live in a ward with some of the highest statistics in the Church attendance was high home teaching numbers were high Primary children were always well behaved ward dinners included fantastic food that members rarely spilled on the meetinghouse floor and I think there were never any arguments at Church ball My friend and his wife were subsequently called on a mission When they returned three years later this couple was astonished to learn that during the time they were away serving 11 marriages had ended in divorce Although the ward had every outward indication of faithfulness and strength something unfortunate was happening in the hearts and lives of the members And the troubling thing is that this situation is not unique Such terrible and often unnecessary things happen when members of the Church become disengaged from gospel principles They may appear on the outside to be disciples of Jesus Christ but on the inside their hearts have separated from their Savior and His teachings They have gradually turned away from the things of the Spirit and moved toward the things of the world Once worthy priesthood holders start to tell themselves that the Church is a good thing for women and children but not for them Or some are convinced that their busy schedules or unique circumstances make them exempt from the daily acts of devotion and service that would keep them close to the Spirit In this age of self justification and narcissism it is easy to become quite creative at coming up with excuses for not regularly approaching God in prayer procrastinating the study of the scriptures avoiding Church meetings and family home evenings or not paying an honest tithe and offerings My dear brethren will you please look inside your hearts and ask the simple question Lord is it I Have you disengaged even slightly from the gospel of the blessed God which was committed to your trust 6 Have you allowed the god of this world to darken your minds to the light of the glorious gospel of Christ 7My beloved friends my dear brethren ask yourselves Where is my treasure Is your heart set on the convenient things of this world or is it focused on the teachings of the diligent Jesus Christ For where your treasure is there will your heart be also 8Does the Spirit of God dwell in your hearts Are you rooted and grounded in the love of God and of your fellowmen Do you devote sufficient time and creativity to bringing happiness to your marriage and family Do you give your energies to the sublime goal of comprehending and living the breadth and length and depth and height 9 of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Brethren if it is your great desire to cultivate Christlike attributes of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness godliness charity humility and service 10 Heavenly Father will make you an instrument in His hands unto the salvation of many souls 11The Examined LifeBrethren none of us likes to admit when we are drifting off the right course Often we try to avoid looking deeply into our souls and confronting our weaknesses limitations and fears Consequently when we do examine our lives we look through the filter of biases excuses and stories we tell ourselves in order to justify unworthy thoughts and actions But being able to see ourselves clearly is essential to our spiritual growth and well being If our weaknesses and shortcomings remain obscured in the shadows then the redeeming power of the Savior cannot heal them and make them strengths 12 Ironically our blindness toward our human weaknesses will also make us blind to the divine potential that our Father yearns to nurture within each of us So how can we shine the pure light of God s truth into our souls and see ourselves as He sees us May I suggest that the holy scriptures and the talks given at general conference are an effective mirror we can hold up for self examination As you hear or read the words of the ancient and modern prophets refrain from thinking about how the words apply to someone else and ask the simple question Lord is it I We must approach our Eternal Father with broken hearts and teachable minds We must be willing to learn and to change And oh how much we gain by committing to live the life our Heavenly Father intends for us Those who do not wish to learn and change probably will not and most likely will begin to wonder whether the Church has anything to offer them But those who want to improve and progress those who learn of the Savior and desire to be like Him those who humble themselves as a little child and seek to bring their thoughts and actions into harmony with our Father in Heaven they will experience the miracle of the Savior s Atonement They will surely feel God s resplendent Spirit They will taste the indescribable joy that is the fruit of a meek and humble heart They will be blessed with the desire and discipline to become true disciples of Jesus Christ The Power of GoodOver the course of my life I have had the opportunity to rub shoulders with some of the most competent and intelligent men and women this world has to offer When I was younger I was impressed by those who were educated accomplished successful and applauded by the world But over the years I have come to the realization that I am far more impressed by those wonderful and blessed souls who are truly good and without guile And isn t that what the gospel is all about and does for us It is the good news and it helps us to become good The words of the Apostle James apply to us today God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up 13Brethren we must put aside our pride see beyond our vanity and in humility ask Lord is it I And if the Lord s answer happens to be Yes my son there are things you must improve things I can help you to overcome I pray that we will accept this answer humbly acknowledge our sins and shortcomings and then change our ways by becoming better husbands better fathers better sons May we from this time forward seek with all our might to walk steadfastly in the Savior s blessed way for seeing ourselves clearly is the beginning of wisdom As we do so our bountiful God will lead us by the hand we will be made strong and blessed from on high 14My beloved friends a first step on this wondrous and fulfilling path of true discipleship starts with our asking the simple question Lord is it I Of this I testify and leave you my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As an airline pilot I flew numerous hours across continents and oceans during the darkness of night Watching the night sky out of my cockpit window especially the Milky Way often made me marvel at the vastness and depth of God s creations what the scriptures describe as worlds without number 1It was less than a century ago that most astronomers assumed that our Milky Way galaxy was the only galaxy in the universe 2 They supposed all that lay beyond our galaxy was an immense nothingness an infinite void empty cold and devoid of stars light and life As telescopes became more sophisticated including telescopes that could be launched into space astronomers began to grasp a spectacular almost incomprehensible truth the universe is mind bogglingly bigger than anyone had previously believed and the heavens are filled with numberless galaxies unimaginably far away from us each containing hundreds of billions of stars 3In a very short period of time our understanding of the universe changed forever Today we can see some of these distant galaxies 4We know that they are there They have been there for a very long time But before mankind had instruments powerful enough to gather celestial light and bring these galaxies into visibility we did not believe such a thing was possible The immensity of the universe didn t suddenly change but our ability to see and understand this truth changed dramatically And with that greater light mankind was introduced to glorious vistas we had never before imagined It Is Hard for Us to Believe What We Cannot SeeSuppose you were able to travel back in time and have a conversation with people who lived a thousand or even a hundred years ago Imagine trying to describe to them some of the modern technologies that you and I take for granted today For example what might these people think of us if we told them stories of jumbo jets microwave ovens handheld devices that contain vast digital libraries and videos of our grandchildren that we instantly share with millions of people around the world Some might believe us Most would ridicule oppose or perhaps even seek to silence or harm us Some might attempt to apply logic reason and facts as they know them to show that we are misguided foolish or even dangerous They might condemn us for attempting to mislead others But of course these people would be completely mistaken They might be well meaning and sincere They might feel absolutely positive of their opinion But they simply would not be able to see clearly because they had not yet received the more complete light of truth The Promise of LightIt seems to be a trait of humanity to assume that we are right even when we are wrong And if that is the case what hope is there for any of us Are we destined to drift aimlessly on an ocean of conflicting information stranded on a raft we have poorly pieced together from our own biases Is it possible to find truth The purpose of my remarks is to proclaim the joyful message that God Himself the Lord of Hosts who knows all truth has given His children the promise that they can know truth for themselves Please consider the magnitude of this promise The Everlasting and Almighty God the Creator of this vast universe will speak to those who approach Him with a sincere heart and real intent He will speak to them in dreams visions thoughts and feelings He will speak in a way that is unmistakable and that transcends human experience He will give them divine direction and answers for their personal lives Of course there will be those who scoff and say such a thing is impossible that if there were a God He would have better things to do than hear and answer a single person s prayer But I tell you this God cares about you He will listen and He will answer your personal questions The answers to your prayers will come in His own way and in His own time and therefore you need to learn to listen to His voice God wants you to find your way back to Him and the Savior is the way 5 God wants you to learn of His Son Jesus Christ and experience the profound peace and joy that come from following the path of divine discipleship My dear friends here is a fairly straightforward experiment with a guarantee from God found in a book of ancient scripture available to every man woman and child willing to put it to the test First you must search the word of God That means reading the scriptures and studying the words of the ancient as well as modern prophets regarding the restored gospel of Jesus Christ not with an intent to doubt or criticize but with a sincere desire to discover truth Ponder upon the things you will feel and prepare your minds to receive the truth 6 Even if ye can no more than desire to believe let this desire work in you that ye can give place for the word of God 7Second you must consider ponder fearlessly strive to believe 8 and be grateful for how merciful the Lord has been to His children from the time of Adam to our day by providing prophets seers and revelators to lead His Church and help us find the way back to Him Third you must ask your Heavenly Father in the name of His Son Jesus Christ to manifest the truth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints unto you Ask with a sincere heart and with real intent having faith in Christ 9There is also a fourth step given to us by the Savior If any man will do God s will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself 10 In other words when you are trying to verify the truth of gospel principles you must first live them Put gospel doctrine and Church teachings to the test in your own life Do it with real intent and enduring faith in God If you will do these things you have a promise from God who is bound by His word11 that He will manifest the truth to you by the power of the Holy Ghost He will grant you greater light that will allow you to look through the darkness and witness unimaginably glorious vistas incomprehensible to mortal sight Some may say that the steps are too hard or that they are not worth the effort But I suggest that this personal testimony of the gospel and the Church is the most important thing you can earn in this life It will not only bless and guide you during this life but it will also have a direct bearing on your life throughout eternity The Things of the Spirit Can Be Understood Only by the SpiritScientists were struggling to understand the breadth of the universe until instruments became sophisticated enough to gather in greater light so they could understand a more complete truth The Apostle Paul taught a parallel principle regarding spiritual knowledge The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God he wrote to the Corinthians for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned 12In other words if you want to recognize spiritual truth you have to use the right instruments You can t come to an understanding of spiritual truth with instruments that are unable to detect it The Savior has told us in our day That which is of God is light and he that receiveth light and continueth in God receiveth more light and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day 13The more we incline our hearts and minds toward God the more heavenly light distills upon our souls And each time we willingly and earnestly seek that light we indicate to God our readiness to receive more light Gradually things that before seemed hazy dark and remote become clear bright and familiar to us By the same token if we remove ourselves from the light of the gospel our own light begins to dim not in a day or a week but gradually over time until we look back and can t quite understand why we had ever believed the gospel was true Our previous knowledge might even seem foolish to us because what once was so clear has again become blurred hazy and distant This is why Paul was so insistent that the message of the gospel is foolishness to those who are perishing but unto those who are saved it is the power of God 14There Is No Litmus TestThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is a place for people with all kinds of testimonies There are some members of the Church whose testimony is sure and burns brightly within them Others are still striving to know for themselves The Church is a home for all to come together regardless of the depth or the height of our testimony I know of no sign on the doors of our meetinghouses that says Your testimony must be this tall to enter The Church is not just for perfect people but it is for all to come unto Christ and be perfected in him 15 The Church is for people like you and me The Church is a place of welcoming and nurturing not of separating or criticizing It is a place where we reach out to encourage uplift and sustain one another as we pursue our individual search for divine truth In the end we are all pilgrims seeking God s light as we journey on the path of discipleship We do not condemn others for the amount of light they may or may not have rather we nourish and encourage all light until it grows clear bright and true A Promise to AllLet us acknowledge that most often gaining a testimony is not a task of a minute an hour or a day It is not once and done The process of gathering spiritual light is the quest of a lifetime Your testimony of the living Son of God and His restored Church The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints may not come as quickly as you desire but I promise you this if you do your part it will come And it will be glorious I offer you my personal witness that spiritual truth will fill your heart and bring light to your spirit It will reveal to you pure intelligence with wonderful joy and heavenly peace I have experienced this for myself by the power of the Holy Ghost As the ancient scriptures promise the unspeakable presence of the Spirit of God will cause you to sing the song of redeeming love 16 lift your eyes to heaven and raise your voice in praise to the Most High God your Refuge your Hope your Protector your Father The Savior promised that if you seek you will find 17I testify that this is true If you seek God s truth that which now may appear dim out of focus and distant will gradually be revealed and clarified and become close to your heart by the light of God s grace Glorious spiritual vistas unimaginable to the human eye will be revealed to you It is my testimony that this spiritual light is within the reach of every child of God It will enlighten your mind and bring healing to your heart and joy to your days My dear friends please do not delay the moment to seek and strengthen your own personal testimony of God s divine work even the work of light and truth Your personal testimony of light and truth will not only bless you and your posterity here in mortality but it will also accompany you throughout all eternity among worlds

Nearly 200 years ago the American short story Rip Van Winkle became an instant classic The main character Rip is an unambitious man who is very good at avoiding two things work and his wife One day while wandering in the mountains with his dog he discovers a group of strangely dressed men drinking and playing games After accepting some of their liquor Rip becomes drowsy and closes his eyes for a moment When he opens his eyes again he is surprised to find that his dog is gone his rifle has rusted and he now has a long beard Rip makes his way back to his village only to discover that everything has changed His wife has died his friends are gone and the portrait of King George III in the tavern has been replaced by a portrait of someone he does not recognize by General George Washington Rip Van Winkle had been sleeping for 20 years And in the process he had missed one of the most exciting periods in the history of his country he had slept through the American Revolution In May 1966 Dr Martin Luther King Jr used this story as an illustration for his speech Don t Sleep Through the Revolution 1Today I would like to take the same theme and propose a question to all of us who hold God s priesthood are you sleeping through the Restoration We Are Living in the Time of the RestorationSometimes we think of the Restoration of the gospel as something that is complete already behind us Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon he received priesthood keys the Church was organized In reality the Restoration is an ongoing process we are living in it right now It includes all that God has revealed all that He does now reveal and the many great and important things that He will yet reveal 2 Brethren the exciting developments of today are part of that long foretold period of preparation that will culminate in the glorious Second Coming of our Savior Jesus Christ This is one of the most remarkable periods of the world s history Ancient prophets yearned to see our day When our time in mortality is complete what experiences will we be able to share about our own contribution to this significant period of our lives and to the furthering of the Lord s work Will we be able to say that we rolled up our sleeves and labored with all our heart might mind and strength Or will we have to admit that our role was mostly that of an observer I suppose there are a variety of reasons why it is easy to become a bit sleepy with regard to building the kingdom of God Let me mention three major ones As I do I invite you to ponder if any might apply If you see room for improvement I ask you to consider what could be done to change for the better SelfishnessFirst selfishness Those who are selfish seek their own interests and pleasure above all else The central question for the selfish person is What s in it for me Brethren I am sure you can see that this attitude is clearly contrary to the spirit required to build God s kingdom When we seek self service over selfless service our priorities become centered on our own recognition and pleasure Past generations had their struggle with variations of egotism and narcissism but I think today we are giving them serious competition Is it any coincidence that the Oxford Dictionary recently proclaimed selfie as the word of the year 3Naturally we all have a desire for recognition and there is nothing wrong with relaxing and enjoying ourselves But when seeking the gain and praise of the world 4 is a central part of our motivation we will miss the redemptive and joyful experiences that come when we give generously of ourselves to the work of the Lord What is the remedy The answer as always lies in the words of Christ Whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me For whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel s the same shall save it 5Those who wholeheartedly turn their lives over to our Savior and serve God and fellowman discover a richness and fulness to life that the selfish or egotistic will never experience The unselfish give of themselves These may be small gifts of charity that have a grand impact for good a smile a handshake a hug time spent in listening a soft word of encouragement or a gesture of caring All these acts of kindness can change hearts and lives When we take advantage of the unlimited opportunities to love and serve our fellowmen including our spouse and family our capacity to love God and to serve others will greatly increase Those who serve others will not sleep through the Restoration AddictionsAnother thing that may cause us to sleepwalk through this significant season of the world is addiction Addictions often begin subtly Addictions are thin threads of repeated action that weave themselves into thick bonds of habit Negative habits have the potential to become consuming addictions These binding chains of addiction can have many forms like pornography alcohol sex drugs tobacco gambling food work the Internet or virtual reality Satan our common enemy has many favorite tools he uses to rob us of our divine potential to accomplish our mission in the Lord s kingdom It saddens our Heavenly Father to see how willingly some of His noble sons extend their wrists to accept the chains of devastating addictions Brethren we bear the eternal priesthood of Almighty God We are truly sons of the Most High and are endowed with unspeakable potential We are designed to soar freely through the heavens We are not meant to be shackled to the earth imprisoned in straitjackets of our own making What is the remedy The first thing we must understand is that addictions are so much easier to prevent than to cure In the Savior s words Suffer none of these things to enter into your heart 6Several years ago President Thomas S Monson and I were offered an opportunity to tour Air Force One the magnificent aircraft that transports the president of the United States There were painstaking security checks by the Secret Service and I smiled a little as agents searched our dear prophet prior to boarding Then the pilot in command invited me to take the captain s seat It was a remarkable experience to again sit at the helm of a wonderful flying machine like the kind I had flown for so many years Memories of flights across oceans and continents filled my heart and mind I envisioned exciting takeoffs and landings at airports all over the world Almost unconsciously I placed my hands on the four throttles of the 747 Just then a beloved and unmistakable voice came from behind the voice of Thomas S Monson Dieter he said don t even think about it I m not admitting to anything but it just may be that President Monson read my mind When we are tempted to do things we should not do let us listen to the loving warning of trusted family and friends our beloved prophet and always the Savior The best defense against addiction is never to start But what of those who find themselves in the grip of addiction Please know first of all that there is hope Seek help from loved ones Church leaders and trained counselors The Church provides addiction recovery help through local Church leaders the Internet 7 and in some areas LDS Family Services Always remember with the Savior s help you can break free from addiction It may be a long difficult path but the Lord will not give up on you He loves you Jesus Christ suffered the Atonement to help you change to free you from the captivity of sin The most important thing is to keep trying sometimes it takes several attempts before people find success So don t give up Don t lose faith Keep your heart close to the Lord and He will give you the power of deliverance He will make you free My dear brethren always keep far away from habits that could lead to addiction Those who do so will be able to devote their heart might mind and strength to the service of God They will not sleep through the Restoration Competing PrioritiesA third obstacle that prevents us from fully engaging in this work is the many competing priorities we face Some of us are so busy that we feel like a cart pulled by a dozen work animals each straining in a different direction A lot of energy is expended but the cart doesn t go anywhere Often we devote our best efforts in pursuit of a hobby a sport vocational interests and community or political issues All these things may be good and honorable but are they leaving us time and energy for what should be our highest priorities What is the remedy Once again it comes from the words of the Savior Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind This is the first and great commandment And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 8Everything else in life should be secondary to these two great priorities Even in Church service it is easy to spend a lot of time just going through the motions without the heart or the substance of discipleship Brethren we as priesthood bearers have committed to be a people who love God and our neighbor and who are willing to demonstrate that love through word and deed That is the essence of who we are as disciples of Jesus Christ Those who live up to these principles will not sleep through the Restoration A Call to AwakenThe Apostle Paul wrote Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light 9My dear friends know that you are sons of light Don t allow selfishness Don t allow habits that could lead to addiction Don t allow competing priorities to lull you into indifference or detachment from blessed discipleship and ennobling priesthood service There is too much at stake for us as individuals as families and as Christ s Church to give only a halfhearted effort to this sacred work Being a disciple of Jesus Christ is not an effort of once a week or once a day It is an effort of once and for all The Lord s promise to His true priesthood holders is almost too grand to comprehend Those who are faithful unto the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods and magnify their callings are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies Therefore all that our Father has will be given unto them 10I testify that the cleansing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the transformative power of the Holy Ghost can heal and rescue mankind It is our privilege our sacred duty and our joy to heed the Savior s call to follow Him with a willing mind and full purpose of heart Let us shake off the chains with which we are bound and come forth out of obscurity and arise from the dust 11Let us be awake and not be weary of well doing for we are laying the foundation of a great work 12 even preparing for the return of the Savior Brethren when we add the light of our example as a witness to the beauty and power of restored truth we will not sleep through the Restoration Of this I testify and leave you my blessing in the sacred name of our Master even Jesus Christ amen 
Over the years I have had the sacred opportunity to meet with many people whose sorrows seem to reach the very depths of their soul In these moments I have listened to my beloved brothers and sisters and grieved with them over their burdens I have pondered what to say to them and I have struggled to know how to comfort and support them in their trials Often their grief is caused by what seems to them as an ending Some are facing the end of a cherished relationship such as the death of a loved one or estrangement from a family member Others feel they are facing the end of hope the hope of being married or bearing children or overcoming an illness Others may be facing the end of their faith as confusing and conflicting voices in the world tempt them to question even abandon what they once knew to be true Sooner or later I believe that all of us experience times when the very fabric of our world tears at the seams leaving us feeling alone frustrated and adrift It can happen to anyone No one is immune We Can Be GratefulEveryone s situation is different and the details of each life are unique Nevertheless I have learned that there is something that would take away the bitterness that may come into our lives There is one thing we can do to make life sweeter more joyful even glorious We can be grateful It might sound contrary to the wisdom of the world to suggest that one who is burdened with sorrow should give thanks to God But those who set aside the bottle of bitterness and lift instead the goblet of gratitude can find a purifying drink of healing peace and understanding As disciples of Christ we are commanded to thank the Lord our God in all things 1 to sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving 2 and to let our heart be full of thanks unto God 3Why does God command us to be grateful All of His commandments are given to make blessings available to us Commandments are opportunities to exercise our agency and to receive blessings Our loving Heavenly Father knows that choosing to develop a spirit of gratitude will bring us true joy and great happiness Being Grateful for ThingsBut some might say What do I have to be grateful for when my world is falling apart Perhaps focusing on what we are grateful for is the wrong approach It is difficult to develop a spirit of gratitude if our thankfulness is only proportional to the number of blessings we can count True it is important to frequently count our blessings and anyone who has tried this knows there are many but I don t believe the Lord expects us to be less thankful in times of trial than in times of abundance and ease In fact most of the scriptural references do not speak of gratitude for things but rather suggest an overall spirit or attitude of gratitude It is easy to be grateful for things when life seems to be going our way But what then of those times when what we wish for seems to be far out of reach Could I suggest that we see gratitude as a disposition a way of life that stands independent of our current situation In other words I m suggesting that instead of being thankful for things we focus on being thankful in our circumstances whatever they may be There is an old story of a waiter who asked a customer whether he had enjoyed the meal The guest replied that everything was fine but it would have been better if they had served more bread The next day when the man returned the waiter doubled the amount of bread giving him four slices instead of two but still the man was not happy The next day the waiter doubled the bread again without success On the fourth day the waiter was really determined to make the man happy And so he took a nine foot long 3 m loaf of bread cut it in half and with a smile served that to the customer The waiter could scarcely wait for the man s reaction After the meal the man looked up and said Good as always But I see you re back to giving only two slices of bread Being Grateful in Our CircumstancesMy dear brothers and sisters the choice is ours We can choose to limit our gratitude based on the blessings we feel we lack Or we can choose to be like Nephi whose grateful heart never faltered When his brothers tied him up on the ship which he had built to take them to the promised land his ankles and wrists were so sore they had swollen exceedingly and a violent storm threatened to swallow him up in the depths of the sea Nevertheless Nephi said I did look unto my God and I did praise him all the day long and I did not murmur against the Lord because of mine afflictions 4We can choose to be like Job who seemed to have everything but then lost it all Yet Job responded by saying Naked came I out of my mother s womb and naked shall I return the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord 5We can choose to be like the Mormon pioneers who maintained a spirit of gratitude during their slow and painful trek toward the Great Salt Lake even singing and dancing and glorying in the goodness of God 6 Many of us would have been inclined to withdraw complain and agonize about the difficulty of the journey We can choose to be like the Prophet Joseph Smith who while a prisoner in miserable conditions in Liberty Jail penned these inspired words Dearly beloved brethren let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power and then may we stand still with the utmost assurance to see the salvation of God and for his arm to be revealed 7We can choose to be grateful no matter what This type of gratitude transcends whatever is happening around us It surpasses disappointment discouragement and despair It blooms just as beautifully in the icy landscape of winter as it does in the pleasant warmth of summer When we are grateful to God in our circumstances we can experience gentle peace in the midst of tribulation In grief we can still lift up our hearts in praise In pain we can glory in Christ s Atonement In the cold of bitter sorrow we can experience the closeness and warmth of heaven s embrace We sometimes think that being grateful is what we do after our problems are solved but how terribly shortsighted that is How much of life do we miss by waiting to see the rainbow before thanking God that there is rain Being grateful in times of distress does not mean that we are pleased with our circumstances It does mean that through the eyes of faith we look beyond our present day challenges This is not a gratitude of the lips but of the soul It is a gratitude that heals the heart and expands the mind Gratitude as an Act of FaithBeing grateful in our circumstances is an act of faith in God It requires that we trust God and hope for things we may not see but which are true 8 By being grateful we follow the example of our beloved Savior who said Not my will but thine be done 9True gratitude is an expression of hope and testimony It comes from acknowledging that we do not always understand the trials of life but trusting that one day we will In any circumstance our sense of gratitude is nourished by the many and sacred truths we do know that our Father has given His children the great plan of happiness that through the Atonement of His Son Jesus Christ we can live forever with our loved ones that in the end we will have glorious perfect and immortal bodies unburdened by sickness or disability and that our tears of sadness and loss will be replaced with an abundance of happiness and joy good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over 10It must have been this kind of testimony that transformed the Savior s Apostles from fearful doubting men into fearless joyful emissaries of the Master In the hours following His Crucifixion they were consumed with despair and grief unable to understand what had just happened But one event changed all of that Their Lord appeared to them and declared Behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself 11When the Apostles recognized the risen Christ when they experienced the glorious Resurrection of their beloved Savior they became different men Nothing could keep them from fulfilling their mission They accepted with courage and determination the torture humiliation and even death that would come to them because of their testimony 12 They were not deterred from praising and serving their Lord They changed the lives of people everywhere They changed the world You do not need to see the Savior as the Apostles did to experience the same transformation Your testimony of Christ born of the Holy Ghost can help you look past the disappointing endings in mortality and see the bright future that the Redeemer of the world has prepared We Are Not Made for EndingsIn light of what we know about our eternal destiny is it any wonder that whenever we face the bitter endings of life they seem unacceptable to us There seems to be something inside of us that resists endings Why is this Because we are made of the stuff of eternity We are eternal beings children of the Almighty God whose name is Endless13 and who promises eternal blessings without number Endings are not our destiny The more we learn about the gospel of Jesus Christ the more we realize that endings here in mortality are not endings at all They are merely interruptions temporary pauses that one day will seem small compared to the eternal joy awaiting the faithful How grateful I am to my Heavenly Father that in His plan there are no true endings only everlasting beginnings Those Who Are Grateful Will Be Made GloriousBrothers and sisters have we not reason to be filled with gratitude regardless of the circumstances in which we find ourselves Do we need any greater reason to let our hearts be full of thanks unto God 14 Have we not great reason to rejoice 15How blessed we are if we recognize God s handiwork in the marvelous tapestry of life Gratitude to our Father in Heaven broadens our perception and clears our vision It inspires humility and fosters empathy toward our fellowmen and all of God s creation Gratitude is a catalyst to all Christlike attributes A thankful heart is the parent of all virtues 16The Lord has given us His promise that those who receive all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious and the things of this earth shall be added unto them even an hundred fold yea more 17May we live in thanksgiving daily 18 especially during the seemingly unexplainable endings that are part of mortality May we allow our souls to expand in thankfulness toward our merciful Heavenly Father May we ever and constantly raise our voices and show by word and deed our gratitude to our Father in Heaven and to His Beloved Son Jesus Christ For this I pray and leave you my testimony and blessing in the name of our Master Jesus Christ amen 
When I was young falling and getting up seemed to be one and the same motion Over the years however I have come to the unsettling conclusion that the laws of physics have changed and not to my advantage Not long ago I was skiing with my 12 year old grandson We were enjoying our time together when I hit an icy spot and ended up making a glorious crash landing on a steep slope I tried every trick to stand up but I couldn t I had fallen and I couldn t get up I felt fine physically but my ego was a bit bruised So I made sure that my helmet and goggles were in place since I much preferred that other skiers not recognize me I could imagine myself sitting there helplessly as they skied by elegantly shouting a cheery Hello Brother Uchtdorf I began to wonder what it would take to rescue me That was when my grandson came to my side I told him what had happened but he didn t seem very interested in my explanations of why I couldn t get up He looked me in the eyes reached out took my hand and in a firm tone said Opa you can do it now Instantly I stood I am still shaking my head over this What had seemed impossible only a moment before immediately became a reality because a 12 year old boy reached out to me and said You can do it now To me it was an infusion of confidence enthusiasm and strength Brethren there may be times in our lives when rising up and continuing on may seem beyond our own ability That day on a snow covered slope I learned something Even when we think we cannot rise up there is still hope And sometimes we just need someone to look us in the eyes take our hand and say You can do it now The Delusion of ToughnessWe may think that women are more likely than men to have feelings of inadequacy and disappointment that these feelings affect them more than us I m not sure that this is true Men experience feelings of guilt depression and failure We might pretend these feelings don t bother us but they do We can feel so burdened by our failures and shortcomings that we begin to think we will never be able to succeed We might even assume that because we have fallen before falling is our destiny As one writer put it We beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past 1I have watched men filled with potential and grace disengage from the challenging work of building the kingdom of God because they had failed a time or two These were men of promise who could have been exceptional priesthood holders and servants of God But because they stumbled and became discouraged they withdrew from their priesthood commitments and pursued other but less worthy endeavors And thus they go on living only a shadow of the life they could have led never rising to the potential that is their birthright As the poet lamented these are among those unfortunate souls who die with most of their music still in them 2No one likes to fail And we particularly don t like it when others especially those we love see us fail We all want to be respected and esteemed We want to be champions But we mortals do not become champions without effort and discipline or without making mistakes Brethren our destiny is not determined by the number of times we stumble but by the number of times we rise up dust ourselves off and move forward Godly SorrowWe know this mortal life is a test But because our Heavenly Father loves us with a perfect love He shows us where to find the answers He has given us the map that allows us to navigate the uncertain terrain and unexpected trials that each of us encounters The words of the prophets are part of this map When we stray when we fall or depart from the way of our Heavenly Father the words of the prophets tell us how to rise up and get back on track Of all the principles taught by prophets over the centuries one that has been emphasized over and over again is the hopeful and heartwarming message that mankind can repent change course and get back on the true path of discipleship That does not mean that we should be comfortable with our weaknesses mistakes or sins But there is an important difference between the sorrow for sin that leads to repentance and the sorrow that leads to despair The Apostle Paul taught that godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation but the sorrow of the world worketh death 3 Godly sorrow inspires change and hope through the Atonement of Jesus Christ Worldly sorrow pulls us down extinguishes hope and persuades us to give in to further temptation Godly sorrow leads to conversion4 and a change of heart 5 It causes us to hate sin and love goodness 6 It encourages us to stand up and walk in the light of Christ s love True repentance is about transformation not torture or torment Yes heartfelt regret and true remorse for disobedience are often painful and very important steps in the sacred process of repentance But when guilt leads to self loathing or prevents us from rising up again it is impeding rather than promoting our repentance Brethren there is a better way Let us rise up and become men of God We have a champion a Savior who walked through the valley of the shadow of death on our behalf He gave Himself as a ransom for our sins No one has ever had greater love than this Jesus Christ the Lamb without blemish willingly laid Himself on the altar of sacrifice and paid the price for our sins to the uttermost farthing 7 He took upon Himself our suffering He took our burdens our guilt upon His shoulders My dear friends when we decide to come to Him when we take upon ourselves His name and boldly walk in the path of discipleship then through the Atonement we are promised not only happiness and peace in this world but also eternal life in the world to come 8When we make mistakes when we sin and fall let us think of what it means to truly repent It means turning our heart and will to God and giving up sin True heartfelt repentance brings with it the heavenly assurance that we can do it now Who Are You One of the adversary s methods to prevent us from progressing is to confuse us about who we really are and what we really desire We want to spend time with our children but we also want to engage in our favorite manly hobbies We want to lose weight but we also want to enjoy the foods we crave We want to become Christlike but we also want to give the guy who cuts us off in traffic a piece of our mind Satan s purpose is to tempt us to exchange the priceless pearls of true happiness and eternal values for a fake plastic trinket that is merely an illusion and counterfeit of happiness and joy Another method the adversary uses to discourage us from rising up is to make us see the commandments as things that have been forced upon us I suppose it is human nature to resist anything that does not appear to be our own idea in the first place If we see healthy eating and exercise as something only our doctor expects of us we will likely fail If we see these choices as who we are and who we want to become we have a greater chance of staying the course and succeeding If we see home teaching as only the stake president s goal we may place a lower value on doing it If we see it as our goal something we desire to do in order to become more Christlike and minister to others we will not only fulfill our commitment but also accomplish it in a way that blesses the families we visit and our own as well Often enough we are the ones who are being helped up by friends or family But if we look around with observant eyes and the motive of a caring heart we will recognize the opportunities the Lord places in front of us to help others rise up and move toward their true potential The scriptures suggest Whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men 9It is a great source of spiritual power to live lives of integrity and righteousness and to keep our eyes on where we want to be in the eternities Even if we can see this divine destination only with the eye of faith it will help us to stay the course When our attention is mainly focused on our daily successes or failures we may lose our way wander and fall Keeping our sights on higher goals will help us become better sons and brothers kinder fathers and more loving husbands Even those who set their hearts upon divine goals may still occasionally stumble but they will not be defeated They trust and rely upon the promises of God They will rise up again with a bright hope in a righteous God and the inspiring vision of a great future They know they can do it now You Can Do It NowEvery person young and old has had his own personal experience with falling Falling is what we mortals do But as long as we are willing to rise up again and continue on the path toward the spiritual goals God has given us we can learn something from failure and become better and happier as a result My dear brethren my dear friends there will be times when you think you cannot continue on Trust the Savior and His love With faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the power and hope of the restored gospel you will be able to walk tall and continue on Brethren we love you We pray for you I wish you could hear President Monson pray for you Whether you are a young father an elderly priesthood bearer or a newly ordained deacon we are mindful of you The Lord is mindful of you We acknowledge that your path will at times be difficult But I give you this promise in the name of the Lord rise up and follow in the footsteps of our Redeemer and Savior and one day you will look back and be filled with eternal gratitude that you chose to trust the Atonement and its power to lift you up and give you strength My dear friends and brethren no matter how many times you have slipped or fallen rise up Your destiny is a glorious one Stand tall and walk in the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ You are stronger than you realize You are more capable than you can imagine You can do it now Of this I testify in the sacred name of our Master and Redeemer Jesus Christ amen 
Once there was a man who dreamed that he was in a great hall where all the religions of the world were gathered He realized that each religion had much that seemed desirable and worthy He met a nice couple who represented The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and asked What do you require of your members We do not require anything they replied But the Lord asks that we consecrate all The couple went on to explain about Church callings home and visiting teaching full time missions weekly family home evenings temple work welfare and humanitarian service and assignments to teach Do you pay your people for all the work they do the man asked Oh no the couple explained They offer their time freely Also the couple continued every six months our Church members spend a weekend attending or watching 10 hours of general conference Ten hours of people giving talks the man wondered What about your weekly church services How long are they Three hours every Sunday Oh my the man said Do members of your church actually do what you have said That and more We haven t even mentioned family history youth camps devotionals scripture study leadership training youth activities early morning seminary maintaining Church buildings and of course there is the Lord s law of health the monthly fast to help the poor and tithing The man said Now I m confused Why would anyone want to join such a church The couple smiled and said We thought you would never ask Why Would Anyone Join Such a Church At a time when many churches throughout the world are experiencing significant decreases in numbers The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints though small in comparison with many others is one of the fastest growing churches in the world As of September 2013 the Church has more than 15 million members around the world There are many reasons for this but may I offer a few The Savior s ChurchFirst this Church was restored in our day by Jesus Christ Himself Here you will find the authority to act in His name to baptize for the remission of sins to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost and to seal on earth and in heaven 1Those who join this Church love the Savior Jesus Christ and they wish to follow Him They rejoice in the knowledge that God speaks to mankind again When they receive sacred priesthood ordinances and make covenants with God they can feel His power in their lives 2 When they enter the holy temple they sense they are in His presence When they read the holy scriptures3 and live the teachings of His prophets they grow closer to the Savior they love so much An Active FaithAnother reason is because the Church provides opportunities for doing good Believing in God is commendable but most people want to do more than listen to inspirational sermons or dream of their mansions above 4 They want to put their faith into practice They want to roll up their sleeves and become engaged in this great cause And that is what happens when they join with us they have many opportunities to transform their talents compassion and time into good works Because we have no paid local clergy in our worldwide congregations our members perform the work of ministry themselves They are called by inspiration Sometimes we volunteer sometimes we are volunteered We see assignments not as burdens but as opportunities to fulfill covenants we gladly make to serve God and His children Treasured BlessingsA third reason why people join the Church is because walking the path of discipleship leads to precious blessings We see baptism as the starting point in our journey of discipleship Our daily walk with Jesus Christ leads to peace and purpose in this life and profound joy and eternal salvation in the world to come Those who follow this path faithfully avoid many of the pitfalls sorrows and regrets of life The poor in spirit and honest of heart find great treasures of knowledge here Those who suffer or grieve find healing here Those burdened with sin find forgiveness liberty and rest To Those Who LeaveThe search for truth has led millions of people to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints However there are some who leave the Church they once loved One might ask If the gospel is so wonderful why would anyone leave Sometimes we assume it is because they have been offended or lazy or sinful Actually it is not that simple In fact there is not just one reason that applies to the variety of situations Some of our dear members struggle for years with the question whether they should separate themselves from the Church In this Church that honors personal agency so strongly that was restored by a young man who asked questions and sought answers we respect those who honestly search for truth It may break our hearts when their journey takes them away from the Church we love and the truth we have found but we honor their right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience just as we claim that privilege for ourselves 5Unanswered QuestionsSome struggle with unanswered questions about things that have been done or said in the past We openly acknowledge that in nearly 200 years of Church history along with an uninterrupted line of inspired honorable and divine events there have been some things said and done that could cause people to question Sometimes questions arise because we simply don t have all the information and we just need a bit more patience When the entire truth is eventually known things that didn t make sense to us before will be resolved to our satisfaction Sometimes there is a difference of opinion as to what the facts really mean A question that creates doubt in some can after careful investigation build faith in others Mistakes of Imperfect PeopleAnd to be perfectly frank there have been times when members or leaders in the Church have simply made mistakes There may have been things said or done that were not in harmony with our values principles or doctrine I suppose the Church would be perfect only if it were run by perfect beings God is perfect and His doctrine is pure But He works through us His imperfect children and imperfect people make mistakes In the title page of the Book of Mormon we read And now if there are faults they are the mistakes of men wherefore condemn not the things of God that ye may be found spotless at the judgment seat of Christ 6This is the way it has always been and will be until the perfect day when Christ Himself reigns personally upon the earth It is unfortunate that some have stumbled because of mistakes made by men But in spite of this the eternal truth of the restored gospel found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is not tarnished diminished or destroyed As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ and as one who has seen firsthand the councils and workings of this Church I bear solemn witness that no decision of significance affecting this Church or its members is ever made without earnestly seeking the inspiration guidance and approbation of our Eternal Father This is the Church of Jesus Christ God will not allow His Church to drift from its appointed course or fail to fulfill its divine destiny There Is Room for YouTo those who have separated themselves from the Church I say my dear friends there is yet a place for you here Come and add your talents gifts and energies to ours We will all become better as a result Some might ask But what about my doubts It s natural to have questions the acorn of honest inquiry has often sprouted and matured into a great oak of understanding There are few members of the Church who at one time or another have not wrestled with serious or sensitive questions One of the purposes of the Church is to nurture and cultivate the seed of faith even in the sometimes sandy soil of doubt and uncertainty Faith is to hope for things which are not seen but which are true 7Therefore my dear brothers and sisters my dear friends please first doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith 8 We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love peace and gifts that come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ Some might say I just don t fit in with you people in the Church If you could see into our hearts you would probably find that you fit in better than you suppose You might be surprised to find that we have yearnings and struggles and hopes similar to yours Your background or upbringing might seem different from what you perceive in many Latter day Saints but that could be a blessing Brothers and sisters dear friends we need your unique talents and perspectives The diversity of persons and peoples all around the globe is a strength of this Church Some might say I don t think I could live up to your standards All the more reason to come The Church is designed to nourish the imperfect the struggling and the exhausted It is filled with people who desire with all their heart to keep the commandments even if they haven t mastered them yet Some might say I know a member of your Church who is a hypocrite I could never join a church that had someone like him as a member If you define hypocrite as someone who fails to live up perfectly to what he or she believes then we are all hypocrites None of us is quite as Christlike as we know we should be But we earnestly desire to overcome our faults and the tendency to sin With our heart and soul we yearn to become better with the help of the Atonement of Jesus Christ If these are your desires then regardless of your circumstances your personal history or the strength of your testimony there is room for you in this Church Come join with us Come Join with Us In spite of our human imperfections I am confident that you will find among the members of this Church many of the finest souls this world has to offer The Church of Jesus Christ seems to attract the kind and the caring the honest and the industrious If you expect to find perfect people here you will be disappointed But if you seek the pure doctrine of Christ the word of God which healeth the wounded soul 9 and the sanctifying influence of the Holy Ghost then here you will find them In this age of waning faith in this age when so many feel distanced from heaven s embrace here you will find a people who yearn to know and draw closer to their Savior by serving God and fellowmen just like you Come join with us Will Ye Also Go Away I am reminded of a time in the Savior s life when many abandoned Him 10 Jesus asked His twelve disciples Will ye also go away Then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life 11There are times when we have to answer the same question Will we also go away Or will we like Peter hold fast to the words of eternal life If you seek truth meaning and a way to transform faith into action if you are looking for a place of belonging Come join with us If you have left the faith you once embraced Come back again Join with us If you are tempted to give up Stay yet a little longer There is room for you here I plead with all who hear or read these words Come join with us Come heed the call of the gentle Christ Take up your cross and follow Him 12Come join with us For here you will find what is precious beyond price I testify that here you will find the words of eternal life the promise of blessed redemption and the pathway to peace and happiness I earnestly pray that your own search for truth will impress upon your heart the desire to come and join with us In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen

My dear brethren and beloved friends it fills my heart with gratitude and joy to be with you I commend you fathers and grandfathers who have brought your sons and grandsons I congratulate you young men who have chosen to be here today This is the place for you to be I hope you can feel the brotherhood that unites us and I pray that here among your brothers you will find belonging support and friendship We men sometimes identify ourselves by titles Many of us have multiple titles and each says something important about our identity For example some titles describe our roles in families such as son brother husband and father Other titles describe our occupations in the world such as doctor soldier or craftsman And some describe our positions within the Church Today I would like to suggest four titles that I believe apply to all priesthood holders around the world titles that may help us recognize our individual roles in God s eternal plan and our potential as priesthood holders in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Son of Heavenly FatherOne title that defines all of us in the most fundamental way is son of Heavenly Father No matter what else we are or do in life we must never forget that we are God s literal spirit children We were His children before we came to this world and we will be His children forevermore This basic truth should change the way we look at ourselves our brothers and sisters and life itself Unfortunately none of us quite lives up to everything that this title implies for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God 1It can be discouraging at times to know what it means to be a son of God and yet come up short The adversary likes to take advantage of these feelings Satan would rather that you define yourself by your sins instead of your divine potential Brethren don t listen to him We have all seen a toddler learn to walk He takes a small step and totters He falls Do we scold such an attempt Of course not What father would punish a toddler for stumbling We encourage we applaud and we praise because with every small step the child is becoming more like his parents Now brethren compared to the perfection of God we mortals are scarcely more than awkward faltering toddlers But our loving Heavenly Father wants us to become more like Him and dear brethren that should be our eternal goal too God understands that we get there not in an instant but by taking one step at a time I do not believe in a God who would set up rules and commandments only to wait for us to fail so He could punish us I believe in a Heavenly Father who is loving and caring and who rejoices in our every effort to stand tall and walk toward Him Even when we stumble He urges us not to be discouraged never to give up or flee our allotted field of service but to take courage find our faith and keep trying Our Father in Heaven mentors His children and often sends unseen heavenly help to those who desire to follow the Savior Disciple of Jesus ChristAnd that leads us to the next title we all have in common all who strive earnestly to follow the Christ are called His disciples Although we recognize that none of us are perfect we do not use that fact as an excuse to lower our expectations to live beneath our privileges to delay the day of our repentance or to refuse to grow into better more perfect more refined followers of our Master and King Remember that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is built not for men and women who are perfect or unaffected by mortal temptations but rather it is built for people exactly like you and me And it is built upon the rock of our Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ 2 through whose Atonement we can be cleansed and become fellowcitizens of the household of God 3Without the Atonement of Jesus Christ life would be a dead end road without hope or future With the Atonement life is an ennobling inspiring journey of growth and development that leads to eternal life in the presence of our Heavenly Father But while the Atonement is meant to help us all become more like Christ it is not meant to make us all the same Sometimes we confuse differences in personality with sin We can even make the mistake of thinking that because someone is different from us it must mean they are not pleasing to God This line of thinking leads some to believe that the Church wants to create every member from a single mold that each one should look feel think and behave like every other This would contradict the genius of God who created every man different from his brother every son different from his father Even identical twins are not identical in their personalities and spiritual identities It also contradicts the intent and purpose of the Church of Jesus Christ which acknowledges and protects the moral agency with all its far reaching consequences of each and every one of God s children As disciples of Jesus Christ we are united in our testimony of the restored gospel and our commitment to keep God s commandments But we are diverse in our cultural social and political preferences The Church thrives when we take advantage of this diversity and encourage each other to develop and use our talents to lift and strengthen our fellow disciples Brethren discipleship is a lifelong journey following our Savior Along our metaphorical path from Bethlehem to Golgotha we will have many opportunities to abandon our journey At times it will seem that the path requires more than we had wished for But as men of the priesthood we must have the courage to follow our Redeemer even when our cross seems too heavy to bear With every step we take following the Son of God we may be reminded that we are not perfect yet But let us be steadfast and constant disciples Let us not give up Let us be true to our covenants Let us never lose sight of our Advocate and Redeemer as we walk toward Him one imperfect step after another Healer of SoulsBrethren if we truly follow our Lord Jesus Christ we must embrace a third title healer of souls We who have been ordained to the priesthood of God are called to practice the healer s art 4It is our job to build up repair strengthen uplift and make whole Our assignment is to follow the Savior s example and reach out to those who suffer We mourn with those that mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort 5 We bind up the wounds of the afflicted We succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 6As home teachers we are healers As priesthood leaders we are healers As fathers sons brothers and husbands we should be committed and dedicated healers We carry in one hand a vial of consecrated oil for blessing the sick in the other we carry a loaf of bread to feed the hungry and in our hearts we carry the peaceable word of God which healeth the wounded soul 7This is our first and foremost responsibility as priesthood holders and it applies to both Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood holders The restored gospel of Jesus Christ blesses lives not just when we believe it but much more when we live it It is in the application of gospel principles that individuals are uplifted and families are strengthened It is our privilege and responsibility not just to talk the talk but also to walk the walk The Savior is the worker of miracles He is the great Healer He is our example our light even in the darkest moments and He shows us the right way Let us follow Him Let us rise up to our role and become healers by serving God and our fellowmen Heir of Eternal LifeThe fourth title we all share returns us to the first title in our list As sons of our Heavenly Father we are heirs to all that He has The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God And if children then heirs heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together 8Think of this my beloved brethren We are joint heirs with Christ So does it make any sense that many of us spend so much of our valuable time thoughts means and energies in pursuit of prestige or worldly goods or to be entertained by the newest and coolest electronic gadgets The Lord has put before us the divine promise that whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods magnifying their calling will receive me saith the Lord and he that receiveth me receiveth my Father therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him 9It is beyond my power of thought to imagine all that this promise entails But I do know it is grand it is divine it is eternal and it is worth all of our efforts in life Knowing this how can we not willingly and joyfully engage in serving the Lord and our fellowmen and living up to our responsibilities in the priesthood of God This is a most noble labor that will challenge our every sense and stretch our every ability Do we desire to see the heavens open and witness the promptings of the Holy Spirit showing us the way Then let s take up our sickle and put our back into this great work a cause much greater than ourselves Serving God and our fellowmen will challenge us and transform us into something greater than we ever thought possible Perhaps you might think that you are not needed that you are overlooked or unwanted that you are nobody I am sincerely sorry if any priesthood holder feels this way Certainly you are not overlooked or unwanted by your Heavenly Father He loves you And I tell you with certainty that you are needed by your Church Do you not know that God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty 10Perhaps it is true that we are weak Perhaps we are not wise or mighty But when God works through us no one and nothing can stand against us 11This is why you are needed You have your own special contribution to make and God can magnify that contribution in a mighty way Your ability to contribute is not dependent upon your calling in the Church Your opportunities for service are endless If you are waiting on the sidelines I encourage you to get in the game Don t wait for a particular calling before you become fully engaged in building the kingdom of God As a priesthood holder you are already called to the work Study the word of God daily pray to Heavenly Father every day internalize the principles of the restored gospel give thanks to God and ask for His guidance Then live what you learn first in your family but also in all situations of your life In the great Composer s symphony you have your own particular part to play your own notes to sing Fail to perform them and with certainty the symphony will go on But if you rise up and join the chorus and allow the power of God to work through you you will see the windows of heaven open and He will pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it 12 Rise up to your true potential as a son of God and you can be a force for good in your family your home your community your nation and indeed in the world And in the process as you lose your life in the service of others 13 you will grow and develop until you reach the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ 14 Then you will be prepared to inherit with Christ everything your Father has You Are Important to GodMy dear brethren my dear friends you are important You are loved You are needed This work is true The priesthood you are privileged to bear is indeed of God I pray that as you ponder the many titles of a worthy priesthood holder you will discover a divine wind at your back lifting you ever upward toward the great inheritance your Heavenly Father has reserved for you I leave you this blessing and my testimony in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Entrance to EnlightenmentI have a cherished painting in my office that is titled Entrance to Enlightenment It was created by a friend of mine the Danish artist Johan Benthin who was the first stake president in Copenhagen Denmark The painting shows a dark room with an open door from which light is shining It is interesting to me that the light coming through the door does not illuminate the entire room only the space immediately in front of the door To me the darkness and light in this painting are a metaphor for life It is part of our condition as mortal beings to sometimes feel as though we are surrounded by darkness We might have lost a loved one a child might have strayed we might have received a troubling medical diagnosis we might have employment challenges and be burdened by doubts or fears or we might feel alone or unloved But even though we may feel lost in the midst of our current circumstances God promises the hope of His light He promises to illuminate the way before us and show us the way out of darkness A Room Filled with DarknessI d like to tell you about a woman who grew up in a room filled with darkness I ll call her Jane From the time Jane was three years old she was repeatedly beaten belittled and abused She was threatened and mocked She awoke each morning not knowing if she would survive until the next day The people who should have protected her were those who tortured her or allowed the abuse to continue In order to protect herself Jane learned to stop feeling She had no hope of rescue so she hardened herself to the horror of her reality There was no light in her world so she became resigned to the darkness With a numbness that can come only from constant and unrelenting contact with evil she accepted the fact that any moment might be her last Then at age 18 Jane discovered The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints The joy and hope of the restored gospel penetrated her heart and she accepted the invitation to be baptized For the first time light entered her life and she saw a bright path before her She left the darkness of her world and decided to attend school a great distance away from her abuser At last she felt liberated from an environment of darkness and evil free to enjoy the Savior s sweet peace and miraculous healing However years later after her abuser had died Jane was again troubled by the horrible events of her youth Profound sadness and anger threatened to destroy the wonderful light she had found in the gospel She realized that if she allowed that darkness to consume her her tormentor would have a final victory She sought counseling and medical help and began to realize that for her the best path for healing was to understand and accept that darkness exists but not to dwell there For as she now knew light also exists and that is where she chose to dwell Given her dark past Jane could easily have become vindictive venomous or violent But she didn t She resisted the temptation to spread the darkness refusing to lash out in anger hurt or cynicism Instead she held fast to the hope that with God s help she could be healed She chose to radiate light and devote her life to helping others This decision enabled her to leave the past behind and to step into a glorious bright future She became a schoolteacher and today decades later her love has influenced the lives of hundreds of children helping them to know that they have worth that they are important She has become a tireless defender of the weak the victimized and the discouraged She builds strengthens and inspires everyone around her Jane learned that healing comes when we move away from the darkness and walk toward the hope of a brighter light It was in the practical application of faith hope and charity that she not only transformed her own life but forever blessed the lives of many many others Light Cleaveth unto LightThere may be some among you who feel darkness encroaching upon you You may feel burdened by worry fear or doubt To you and to all of us I repeat a wonderful and certain truth God s light is real It is available to all It gives life to all things 1 It has the power to soften the sting of the deepest wound It can be a healing balm for the loneliness and sickness of our souls In the furrows of despair it can plant the seeds of a brighter hope It can enlighten the deepest valleys of sorrow It can illuminate the path before us and lead us through the darkest night into the promise of a new dawn This is the Spirit of Jesus Christ which gives light to every man that cometh into the world 2Nevertheless spiritual light rarely comes to those who merely sit in darkness waiting for someone to flip a switch It takes an act of faith to open our eyes to the Light of Christ Spiritual light cannot be discerned by carnal eyes Jesus Christ Himself taught I am the light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not 3 For the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned 4So how do we open our eyes to the hope of God s light First start where you are Isn t it wonderful to know that we don t have to be perfect to experience the blessings and gifts of our Heavenly Father We don t have to wait to cross the finish line to receive God s blessings In fact the heavens begin to part and the blessings of heaven begin to distill upon us with the very first steps we take toward the light The perfect place to begin is exactly where you are right now It doesn t matter how unqualified you may think you are or how far behind others you may feel The very moment you begin to seek your Heavenly Father in that moment the hope of His light will begin to awaken enliven and ennoble your soul 5 The darkness may not dissipate all at once but as surely as night always gives way to dawn the light will come Second turn your heart toward the Lord Lift up your soul in prayer and explain to your Heavenly Father what you are feeling Acknowledge your shortcomings Pour out your heart and express your gratitude Let Him know of the trials you are facing Plead with Him in Christ s name for strength and support Ask that your ears may be opened that you may hear His voice Ask that your eyes may be opened that you may see His light Third walk in the light Your Heavenly Father knows that you will make mistakes He knows that you will stumble perhaps many times This saddens Him but He loves you He does not wish to break your spirit On the contrary He desires that you rise up and become the person you were designed to be To that end He sent His Son to this earth to illuminate the way and show us how to safely cross the stumbling blocks placed in our path He has given us the gospel which teaches the way of the disciple It teaches us the things we must know do and be to walk in His light following in the footsteps of His Beloved Son our Savior Light Overcomes DarknessYes we will make mistakes Yes we will falter But as we seek to increase our love for God and strive to love our neighbor the light of the gospel will surround and uplift us The darkness will surely fade because it cannot exist in the presence of light As we draw near to God He will draw near to us 6 And day by day the hope of God s light will grow within us brighter and brighter until the perfect day 7To all who feel they walk in darkness I invite you to rely on this certain promise spoken by the Savior of mankind I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life 8A Light in AfricaSome years ago my wife Harriet and I had a memorable experience in which we saw this promise fulfilled We were in West Africa a beautiful part of the world where the Church is growing and the Latter day Saints are delightful However West Africa also has many challenges In particular I was sorrowed by the poverty that I saw In the cities there is high unemployment and families often struggle to provide for their daily needs and for their safety It broke my heart to know that many of our precious members of the Church live in such deprivation But I also learned that these fine members help each other to lighten their heavy burdens We eventually arrived at one of our meetinghouses near a large city But instead of finding a people burdened and absorbed by darkness we discovered a joyful people who were radiating with light The happiness they felt for the gospel was contagious and lifted our spirits The love they expressed for us was humbling Their smiles were genuine and infectious I remember wondering at the time if there could possibly be a happier people on the face of the planet Even though these dear Saints were surrounded by difficulties and trials they were filled with light The meeting began and I started to speak But soon the power went out in the building and we were left in complete darkness For a while I could hardly see anyone in the congregation but I could see and feel the brilliant and beautiful smiles of our Saints Oh how I loved being with these wonderful people The darkness in the chapel continued and so I sat next to my wife and waited for the power to be restored As we waited something remarkable happened A few voices began singing one of the hymns of the Restoration And then others joined in And then more Soon a sweet and overwhelming chorus of voices filled the chapel These members of the Church did not need hymnbooks they knew every word of every hymn they sang And they sang one song after another with an energy and spirit that touched my soul Eventually the lights sparked back on and bathed the room with light Harriet and I looked at each other our cheeks wet with tears In the midst of great darkness these beautiful wonderful Saints had filled this Church building and our souls with light It was a profoundly moving moment for us one Harriet and I will never forget Come to the LightYes from time to time our lives may seem to be touched by or even wrapped in darkness Sometimes the night that surrounds us will appear oppressive disheartening and frightening My heart grieves for the many sorrows some of you face for the painful loneliness and wearisome fears you may be experiencing Nevertheless I bear witness that our living hope is in Christ Jesus He is the true pure and powerful entrance to divine enlightenment I testify that with Christ darkness cannot succeed Darkness will not gain victory over the light of Christ I bear witness that darkness cannot stand before the brilliant light of the Son of the living God I invite each of you to open your heart to Him Seek Him through study and prayer Come to His Church even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Learn of Him and of His gospel participate actively help each other and joyfully serve our God Brothers and sisters even after the darkest night the Savior of the world will lead you to a gradual sweet and bright dawn that will assuredly rise within you As you walk toward the hope of God s light you will discover the compassion love and goodness of a loving Heavenly Father in whom there is no darkness at all 9 Of this I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
We are honored this evening with the presence of President Thomas S Monson our beloved prophet President we always pray for you My dear sisters thank you for the music and the spoken word All was so inspiring and so fitting for Easter the sacred season we celebrate this week It is a joy to be with you precious young sisters together with your mothers and your wonderful leaders You have radiant spirits and contagious smiles Surely the Lord is mindful of you and looks lovingly from heaven upon you I grew up in Zwickau in the former East Germany When I was about 11 years old my father fell under increased scrutiny as a political dissenter and my parents felt that the only safe choice for our family would be to flee to West Germany It was decided that the safest plan was to leave at different times and follow different routes to the West leaving all our belongings behind Since my father was at greatest risk he took the quickest journey through Berlin My older brothers headed north and each found his own way west My sister who would have been the age of many of you here today together with Helga Fassmann her teacher in Young Women and some others took a train that passed briefly through West Germany They paid a porter to unlock one of the doors for them and after the train crossed the West German border they jumped from the moving train to freedom How I admired my sister for her courage I was the youngest child and my mother decided that she and I would walk across a mountain range separating the two countries I remember that she packed a lunch as if we were going for a hike or a picnic in the mountains We took a train as far as we could and then walked for long hours getting ever closer to the West German border The borders were tightly controlled but we had a map and knew of a time and a place where it might be safe to cross I could sense my mother s anxiety She observed the area intensely to see if we were being followed With each step her legs and knees seemed to become weaker I helped carry her heavy bag filled with food vital documents and family photos as we climbed up one last long hill Surely she thought we had passed the border by now When she finally felt safe we sat down and started to eat our picnic lunch For the first time that day I m sure she breathed more easily It was only then that we noticed the border sign It was still far ahead of us We were having our picnic on the wrong side of the border We were still in East Germany Border guards could show up any moment My mother frantically packed up our lunch and we hurried up the hillside as quickly as we could This time we didn t dare stop until we knew with certainty that we had reached the other side of the border Even though each member of our family had taken very different routes and experienced very different hardships along the way eventually all of us made it to safety We were finally reunited as a family What a glorious day that was Journey StoriesWhat I have just told you is an experience that is to me a very precious journey I can now look back on my life and recognize a number of such journeys I have taken over time Not all of them involved crossing mountain ranges or political boundaries some had more to do with overcoming trials or growing in spirituality But they were all journeys I believe that every life is a collection of individual journey stories I am sure you are aware that every cultural tradition is rich with journey stories For instance you may be familiar with the journey of Dorothy and her dog Toto in The Wizard of Oz Dorothy and Toto are swept up in a tornado and deposited in the Land of Oz There Dorothy finds that distinctive yellow brick road that marks the path for a journey that eventually leads her home Then there is Charles Dickens s Ebenezer Scrooge whose journey takes him not from place to place but from time to time It s a journey right within his own heart that helped him to understand why he became the way he was and to see what would happen to him if he continued on his path of selfishness and ingratitude 1One of the great classical novels of Chinese literature is Journey to the West Written in the 16th century it tells beautifully the adventure story and pilgrimage of a monk who with the help of four friendly characters journeys toward spiritual enlightenment And of course there is Bilbo Baggins the small unassuming hobbit who would have very much preferred to stay home and eat his soup But after a knock at his door he follows the call of the great unknown and steps out into the world together with a wizard and a band of dwarfs to fulfill a dangerous but vitally important mission 2A Universal StoryDon t we love these journey stories because we can see ourselves in the travelers Their successes and failures can help us find our own way through life The video we saw a few minutes ago also tells a beautiful journey story Perhaps these stories also remind us of a journey we all should be familiar with a journey story in which each one of us plays an important part This story begins a very long time ago long before the earth began spinning in its orbit long before the sun began to reach its fiery arms into the cold of space long before creatures great and small had populated our planet At the beginning of this story you lived in a faraway beautiful place We do not know many details about life in that premortal sphere but we do know some Our Heavenly Father has revealed to us who He is who we are and who we can become Back in that first estate you knew with absolute certainty that God existed because you saw and heard Him You knew Jesus Christ who would become the Lamb of God You had faith in Him And you knew that your destiny was not to stay in the security of your premortal home As much as you loved that eternal sphere you knew you wanted and needed to embark on a journey You would depart from the arms of your Father pass through a veil of forgetfulness receive a mortal body and learn and experience things that hopefully would help you grow to become more like Father in Heaven and return to His presence In that sacred place surrounded by those you knew and loved the great question on your lips and in your heart must have been Will I return safely to my heavenly home There were so many things that would be out of your control Mortal life would be hard at times filled with unexpected bends in the road sickness heartbreak accidents conflict Without a memory of your previous existence without remembering that you once walked with your Father in Heaven would you still recognize His voice amid all the noise and distractions of mortal life The journey ahead seemed so long and uncertain so filled with risk It wouldn t be easy but you knew it was worth every effort So there you stood on the edge of eternity looking forward with unspeakable excitement and hope and I imagine also with a degree of worry and fear In the end you knew God would be just that His goodness would triumph You had participated in the great heavenly councils and knew that your Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ would provide a way for you to be cleansed from sin and rescued from physical death You had faith that in the end you would rejoice and join your voice with a heavenly chorus singing praises to His holy name And so you took a deep breath And a great step forward And here you are You have each one of you embarked on your own wonderful journey back to your heavenly home Your MapNow that you are here on earth it might be wise to ask yourself how your journey is going Are you on the right course Are you becoming the person you were designed to be and wanted to become Are you making choices that will help you to return to your Father in Heaven He didn t send you on this journey only to wander aimlessly on your own He wants you to come home to Him He has given you loving parents and faithful Church leaders along with a map that describes the terrain and identifies the dangers the map shows you where peace and happiness can be found and will help you plot your course back home Now where do you find this map In the sacred scriptures In the words of prophets and apostles And through personal revelation from the Holy Ghost This map is the gospel of Jesus Christ the good news and the joyful way of a disciple of Christ It is the commandments and example given to us by our Advocate and Mentor who knows the way because He is the way 3Of course simply having a map doesn t do any good unless you study it unless you use it to navigate through life I invite you to make it a high priority to study and apply God s word Open your heart to the Holy Ghost so that He can direct you along your journey through life Your map is full of encouraging and instructive messages from your Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ Today I would like to share with you three of those messages that will help you to have a successful journey back to your heavenly home The first message Do not fear for I the Lord am with you 4You are not alone on this journey Your Heavenly Father knows you Even when no one else hears you He hears you When you rejoice in righteousness He rejoices with you When you are beset with trial He grieves with you Heavenly Father s interest in you does not depend on how rich or beautiful or healthy or smart you are He sees you not as the world sees you He sees who you really are He looks on your heart 5 And He loves you6 because you are His child Dear sisters seek Him earnestly and you will find Him 7I promise you you are not alone Now take a moment right now and look at the people around you Some may be your leaders friends or family members Others you may have never met before Nevertheless everyone you see around you in this meeting or at any other place today or at any other time was valiant in the premortal world That unassuming and ordinary looking person sitting next to you may have been one of the great figures you loved and admired in the sphere of spirits You may have been such a role model yourself Of one thing you can be certain every person you see no matter the race religion political beliefs body type or appearance is family The young woman you look at has the same Heavenly Father as you and she left His loving presence just as you did eager to come to this earth and live so that she could one day return to Him However she might feel alone just as you sometimes do She may even occasionally forget the purpose of her journey Please remind her through your words and your actions that she is not alone We are here to help each other Life can be difficult and it can harden hearts to the point where certain people seem unreachable Some may be filled with anger Others may mock and ridicule those who believe in a loving God But consider this though they do not remember they too at one time yearned to return to their Father in Heaven It is not your responsibility to convert anyone That is the work of the Holy Ghost Your task is to share your beliefs and to not be afraid Be a friend to all but never compromise your standards Stand true to your convictions and faith Stand tall because you are a daughter of God and He stands with you The second message Love one another as I have loved you 8Have you ever wondered what language we all spoke when we lived in the presence of God I have strong suspicions that it was German though I suppose no one knows for sure But I do know that in our premortal life we learned firsthand from the Father of our spirits a universal language one that has the power to overcome emotional physical and spiritual barriers That language is the pure love of Jesus Christ It is the most powerful language in the world The love of Christ is not a pretend love It is not a greeting card love It is not the kind of love that is praised in popular music and movies This love brings about real change of character It can penetrate hatred and dissolve envy It can heal resentment and quench the fires of bitterness It can work miracles We received our first lessons 9 in this language of love as spirits in God s presence and here on earth we have opportunities to practice it and become fluent You can know if you are learning this language of love by evaluating what motivates your thoughts and actions When your primary thoughts are focused on how things will benefit you your motivations may be selfish and shallow That is not the language you want to learn But when your primary thoughts and behaviors are focused on serving God and others when you truly desire to bless and lift up those around you then the power of the pure love of Christ can work in your heart and life That is the language you want to learn As you become fluent in this language and use it in your interactions with others they will recognize something in you that may awaken in them a long hidden feeling to search for the right way on the journey back to their heavenly home After all the language of love is their true native language too This deep and abiding influence is a language that reaches to the very soul It is a language of understanding a language of service a language of lifting and rejoicing and comforting Learn to use the universal language of Christ s love And the third message Be of good cheer 10Sometimes we become impatient with where we are in our journey don t we If you are 12 years old you might wish you were 14 At 14 you might wish you were 18 And at 18 occasionally you might even wish you were 12 again and could start all over There will always be things to complain about things that don t seem to go quite right You can spend your days feeling sad alone misunderstood or unwanted But that isn t the journey you had hoped for and it s not the journey Heavenly Father sent you to take Remember you are truly a daughter of God With this in mind I invite you to walk confidently and joyfully Yes the road has bumps and detours and even some hazards But don t focus on them Look for the happiness your Father in Heaven has prepared for you in every step of your journey Happiness is the destination but it s also the path Peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come is what He promises 11 That is why He commands us to be of good cheer As you joyfully use the map your loving Father has provided for your journey it will lead you to holy places and you will rise to your supernal potential You will grow into the daughter of God you hoped you would become Dear sisters dear young women of the Church dear young friends as an Apostle of the Lord I leave you a blessing that you will find your way on this journey home and that you will be an inspiration to your fellow travelers It is also my promise and prayer that as you honor and live true to the covenants the principles and the values of the gospel of Jesus Christ at the end of your journey Heavenly Father will be there He will embrace you and you will know once and for all that you have made it home safely In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Joy of FlyingMany years ago a couple of fellow airline captains and I decided to fulfill a boyhood dream of restoring an antique airplane Together we purchased a worn down 1938 Piper Cub and started the work of returning it to its original form The project was a labor of love It had special meaning for me because I had learned to fly in a similar airplane when I was a young man This airplane was first built only 35 years after the Wright brothers made their famous first flight Just thinking of that makes me feel very old The engine did not have an electric starter as you were priming the engine from the cockpit someone else on the ground would grab hold of the propeller and hurl it with might until the engine would run on its own Each engine start was a moment of excitement and bravery Once the plane was airborne it became clear the Piper Cub was not built for speed As a matter of fact when there was a strong headwind it seemed as though we were not moving at all I remember flying together with my teenage son Guido above the autobahn in Germany and sure enough the cars below passed us comfortably But oh how I loved this little plane It was the perfect way to experience the wonder and beauty of flight You could hear feel smell taste and see what flying was all about The Wright brothers expressed it this way There is nothing equal to that which aviators enjoy while being carried through the air on great white wings 1In contrast earlier this year I had the privilege to fly in a sophisticated F 18 fighter jet with the world famous Blue Angels the United States Navy s flight demonstration team It was like taking a flight above and along memory lane because exactly 50 years before almost to the day I had completed my training as an air force fighter pilot The F 18 flight experience of course was totally different from the one in the Piper Cub It showed me a more dynamic beauty of flying It was like applying the existing laws of aerodynamics in a more perfect way However flying with the Blue Angels also quickly reminded me that being a jet fighter pilot is a young man s game To quote the Wright brothers again More than anything else the sensation of flying is one of perfect peace mingled with an excitement that strains every nerve to the utmost 2 In addition flying with the Blue Angels suggested a totally different way of having angels round about you and bearing you up If you were to ask me which of these two flying experiences I enjoyed more I m not sure I could tell you In some obvious ways they were very different to say the least And yet in other ways they were very much the same In both the Piper Cub and the F 18 I felt the excitement beauty and joy of flight In both I could feel the call of the poet to slip the surly bonds of Earth and dance the skies on laughter silvered wings 3The Same Priesthood EverywhereNow you might ask what do these two totally different flying experiences have to do with our meeting today or with the priesthood we are privileged to bear or with the priesthood service we all love so much Brethren isn t it true that our individual experiences of service in the priesthood may all be quite different We could say some of you are flying in F 18 jets while others are flying in Piper Cubs Some of you live in wards and stakes where every position from assistant to the high priests group leader to the deacons quorum secretary is filled with an active priesthood holder Yours is the privilege to participate in a ward organization that is well staffed Others of you live in areas of the world where there is only a small handful of Church members and priesthood holders You may feel alone and burdened with the weight of all that needs to be done For you it may take a lot of personal hands on involvement to get the engine of priesthood service started Sometimes it may even seem that your branch or ward is not moving forward at all However no matter what your responsibilities or circumstances may be you and I know there is always a special joy that comes from dedicated priesthood service I always loved flying whether it was in a Piper Cub an F 18 or any other plane While in the Piper Cub I did not complain about the lack of speed while in the F 18 I did not grumble when the strain of the aerobatic maneuvers mercilessly revealed the realities of my advancing age Yes there is always something imperfect in any situation Yes it is easy to find things to complain about But brethren we are bearers of the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God Each of us had hands laid upon our head and we received the priesthood of God We have been given authority and responsibility to act in His name as His servants on earth Whether in a large ward or a small branch we are called upon to serve to bless and to act in all things for the good of everyone and everything entrusted to our care Could there be anything more exhilarating Let us understand appreciate and feel the joy of service in the priesthood The Joy of the PriesthoodMy love for flying influenced the direction of my entire life But as invigorating and blissful as my experiences as a pilot were my experiences as a member of this Church have been much deeper more joyful and far more profound As I have immersed myself in Church service I have felt God s almighty power as well as His tender mercies As a pilot I have touched the skies As a Church member I have felt heaven s embrace Every now and then I miss sitting in a cockpit But serving alongside my brothers and sisters in the Church easily makes up for it Being able to feel the sublime peace and joy that grow from being a small part of this great cause and work I would not want to miss for anything in the world Today we are assembled as a vast body of the priesthood It is our sacred joy and privilege to serve the Lord and our fellowmen to commit the best that is within us to the noble cause of lifting others and building the kingdom of God We know and understand that the priesthood is the eternal power and authority of God We can easily recite this definition from memory However do we truly comprehend the significance of what we re saying Let me repeat the priesthood is the eternal power and authority of God Think of it Through the priesthood God created and governs the heavens and the earth Through this power He redeems and exalts His children bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 4The priesthood as the Prophet Joseph Smith explained is the channel through which the Almighty commenced revealing His glory at the creation of this earth and through which He has continued to reveal Himself to the children of men to the present time and through which He will make known His purposes to the end of time 5Our all powerful Father in Heaven has entrusted priesthood authority to us mortal beings who by definition are flawed and imperfect He grants to us the authority to act in His name for the salvation of His children By this great power we are authorized to preach the gospel administer the ordinances of salvation help build the kingdom of God on the earth and bless and serve our families and our fellowmen Available to AllThis is the sacred priesthood we bear The priesthood or any responsibility within it cannot be purchased or commanded The use of priesthood power cannot be influenced swayed or compelled by position by wealth or by influence It is a spiritual power that operates on heavenly law It originates in the great Heavenly Father of us all Its power can be controlled and directed only through principles of righteousness 6 not self righteousness Christ is the source of all true priesthood authority and power on earth 7 It is His work in which we are privileged to assist And no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love having faith hope and charity being temperate in all things whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care 8We do not act for personal gain but rather we seek to serve and to lift up others We lead not by force but through persuasion long suffering gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned 9The priesthood of Almighty God is available to worthy men wherever they may be no matter their ancestry no matter how humble their circumstances in the nearest or farthest reaches of the globe It is available without money or any worldly price To paraphrase the ancient prophet Isaiah everyone who is thirsty can come to the waters and no money is required to come and eat 10And because of the eternal and unfathomable Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ the priesthood of God can be available even if you have stumbled or have been unworthy in the past Through the spiritually refining and cleansing process of repentance you can arise and shine forth 11 Because of the boundless forgiving love of our Savior and Redeemer you can lift up your eyes become clean and worthy and develop into righteous and noble sons of God worthy bearers of the most sacred priesthood of Almighty God The Wonder and Privilege of the PriesthoodI feel a certain sadness for those who do not grasp and appreciate the wonder and privilege of the priesthood They are like passengers on an airplane who spend their time grumbling about the size of the packet of peanuts while they are soaring through the air far above the clouds something ancient kings would have given all they possessed to try and experience just once Brethren we are blessed to be humble partakers of this great priesthood authority and power Let us lift up our eyes and see recognize and accept this opportunity for what it really is Through righteous loving and dedicated priesthood service we will be able to experience the true meaning of the revelation I will go before your face I will be on your right hand and on your left and my Spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up 12Let us embrace and understand the wonder and privilege of the priesthood Let us accept and love the responsibilities we are asked to fulfill responsibilities in our homes and in our Church units no matter how large or small they may be Let us constantly increase in righteousness dedication and priesthood service Let us find the joy of serving in the priesthood We can do this best by applying the principles of knowledge obedience and faith That means first we need to know and internalize the doctrine of the priesthood found in the revealed word of God It is important for us to understand the covenants and commandments upon which the priesthood operates 13Next let us be wise and act upon this gained knowledge constantly and honorably As we obey God s laws discipline our minds and bodies and attune our actions to the patterns of righteousness taught by the prophets we will experience the joy of priesthood service And finally let us deepen our faith in our Lord Jesus Christ Let us take upon ourselves His name and commit each single day to walk anew in the path of discipleship Let our works make our faith perfect 14 Through discipleship we may be perfected one step at a time by serving our family our fellowmen and God When we serve in the priesthood with all our heart might mind and strength we have a promise of sublime knowledge peace and spiritual gifts As we honor the holy priesthood God will honor us and we will stand blameless before Him at the last day 15That we may always have eyes to see and a heart to feel the wonder and joy of the priesthood of our great and mighty God is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Of RegretsPresident Monson we love you Thank you for the inspired and historic announcement on the building of new temples and missionary service Because of them I m sure great blessings will come to us and to many future generations My dear brothers and sisters my dear friends We are all mortal I hope this does not come as a surprise to anyone None of us will be on earth very long We have a number of precious years which in the eternal perspective barely amount to the blink of an eye And then we depart Our spirits are taken home to that God who gave us life 1 We lay our bodies down and leave behind the things of this world as we move to the next realm of our existence When we are young it seems that we will live forever We think there is a limitless supply of sunrises waiting just beyond the horizon and the future looks to us like an unbroken road stretching endlessly before us However the older we get the more we tend to look back and marvel at how short that road really is We wonder how the years could have passed so quickly And we begin to think about the choices we made and the things we have done In the process we remember many sweet moments that give warmth to our souls and joy to our hearts But we also remember the regrets the things we wish we could go back and change A nurse who cares for the terminally ill says that she has often asked a simple question of her patients as they prepared to depart this life Do you have any regrets she would ask 2Being so close to that final day of mortality often gives clarity to thought and provides insight and perspective So when these people were asked about their regrets they opened their hearts They reflected about what they would change if only they could turn back the clock As I considered what they had said it struck me how the foundational principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ can affect our life s direction for good if only we will apply them There is nothing mysterious about the principles of the gospel We have studied them in the scriptures we have discussed them in Sunday School and we have heard them from the pulpit many times These divine principles and values are straightforward and clear they are beautiful profound and powerful and they can definitely help us to avoid future regrets I Wish I Had Spent More Time with the People I LovePerhaps the most universal regret dying patients expressed was that they wished they had spent more time with the people they love Men in particular sang this universal lament they deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the daily treadmill of work 3 Many had lost out on choice memories that come from spending time with family and friends They missed developing a deep connection with those who meant the most to them Isn t it true that we often get so busy And sad to say we even wear our busyness as a badge of honor as though being busy by itself was an accomplishment or sign of a superior life Is it I think of our Lord and Exemplar Jesus Christ and His short life among the people of Galilee and Jerusalem I have tried to imagine Him bustling between meetings or multitasking to get a list of urgent things accomplished I can t see it Instead I see the compassionate and caring Son of God purposefully living each day When He interacted with those around Him they felt important and loved He knew the infinite value of the people He met He blessed them ministered to them He lifted them up healed them He gave them the precious gift of His time In our day it is easy to merely pretend to spend time with others With the click of a mouse we can connect with thousands of friends without ever having to face a single one of them Technology can be a wonderful thing and it is very useful when we cannot be near our loved ones My wife and I live far away from precious family members we know how that is However I believe that we are not headed in the right direction individually and as a society when we connect with family or friends mostly by reposting humorous pictures forwarding trivial things or linking our loved ones to sites on the Internet I suppose there is a place for this kind of activity but how much time are we willing to spend on it If we fail to give our best personal self and undivided time to those who are truly important to us one day we will regret it Let us resolve to cherish those we love by spending meaningful time with them doing things together and cultivating treasured memories I Wish I Had Lived Up to My PotentialAnother regret people expressed was that they failed to become the person they felt they could and should have been When they looked back on their lives they realized that they never lived up to their potential that too many songs remained unsung I am not speaking here of climbing the ladder of success in our various professions That ladder no matter how lofty it may appear on this earth barely amounts to a single step in the great eternal journey awaiting us Rather I am speaking of becoming the person God our Heavenly Father intended us to be We arrive in this world as the poet said trailing clouds of glory 4 from the premortal sphere Our Heavenly Father sees our real potential He knows things about us that we do not know ourselves He prompts us during our lifetime to fulfill the measure of our creation to live a good life and to return to His presence Why then do we devote so much of our time and energy to things that are so fleeting so inconsequential and so superficial Do we refuse to see the folly in the pursuit of the trivial and transient Would it not be wiser for us to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal 5How do we do this By following the example of the Savior by incorporating His teachings in our daily lives by truly loving God and our fellowman We certainly cannot do this with a dragging our feet staring at our watch complaining as we go approach to discipleship When it comes to living the gospel we should not be like the boy who dipped his toe in the water and then claimed he went swimming As sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father we are capable of so much more For that good intentions are not enough We must do Even more important we must become what Heavenly Father wants us to be Declaring our testimony of the gospel is good but being a living example of the restored gospel is better Wishing to be more faithful to our covenants is good actually being faithful to sacred covenants including living a virtuous life paying our tithes and offerings keeping the Word of Wisdom and serving those in need is much better Announcing that we will dedicate more time for family prayer scripture study and wholesome family activities is good but actually doing all these things steadily will bring heavenly blessings to our lives Discipleship is the pursuit of holiness and happiness It is the path to our best and happiest self Let us resolve to follow the Savior and work with diligence to become the person we were designed to become Let us listen to and obey the promptings of the Holy Spirit As we do so Heavenly Father will reveal to us things we never knew about ourselves He will illuminate the path ahead and open our eyes to see our unknown and perhaps unimagined talents The more we devote ourselves to the pursuit of holiness and happiness the less likely we will be on a path to regrets The more we rely on the Savior s grace the more we will feel that we are on the track our Father in Heaven has intended for us I Wish I Had Let Myself Be HappierAnother regret of those who knew they were dying may be somewhat surprising They wished they had let themselves be happier So often we get caught up in the illusion that there is something just beyond our reach that would bring us happiness a better family situation a better financial situation or the end of a challenging trial The older we get the more we look back and realize that external circumstances don t really matter or determine our happiness We do matter We determine our happiness You and I are ultimately in charge of our own happiness My wife Harriet and I love riding our bicycles It is wonderful to get out and enjoy the beauties of nature We have certain routes we like to bike but we don t pay too much attention to how far we go or how fast we travel in comparison with other riders However occasionally I think we should be a bit more competitive I even think we could get a better time or ride at a higher speed if only we pushed ourselves a little more And then sometimes I even make the big mistake of mentioning this idea to my wonderful wife Her typical reaction to my suggestions of this nature is always very kind very clear and very direct She smiles and says Dieter it s not a race it s a journey Enjoy the moment How right she is Sometimes in life we become so focused on the finish line that we fail to find joy in the journey I don t go cycling with my wife because I m excited about finishing I go because the experience of being with her is sweet and enjoyable Doesn t it seem foolish to spoil sweet and joyful experiences because we are constantly anticipating the moment when they will end Do we listen to beautiful music waiting for the final note to fade before we allow ourselves to truly enjoy it No We listen and connect to the variations of melody rhythm and harmony throughout the composition Do we say our prayers with only the amen or the end in mind Of course not We pray to be close to our Heavenly Father to receive His Spirit and feel His love We shouldn t wait to be happy until we reach some future point only to discover that happiness was already available all the time Life is not meant to be appreciated only in retrospect This is the day which the Lord hath made the Psalmist wrote Rejoice and be glad in it 6Brothers and sisters no matter our circumstances no matter our challenges or trials there is something in each day to embrace and cherish There is something in each day that can bring gratitude and joy if only we will see and appreciate it Perhaps we should be looking less with our eyes and more with our hearts I love the quote One sees clearly only with the heart Anything essential is invisible to the eyes 7We are commanded to give thanks in all things 8 So isn t it better to see with our eyes and hearts even the small things we can be thankful for rather than magnifying the negative in our current condition The Lord has promised He who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious and the things of this earth shall be added unto him even an hundred fold 9Brothers and sisters with the bountiful blessings of our Heavenly Father His generous plan of salvation the supernal truths of the restored gospel and the many beauties of this mortal journey have we not reason to rejoice 10Let us resolve to be happy regardless of our circumstances Of ResolutionsOne day we will take that unavoidable step and cross from this mortal sphere into the next estate One day we will look back at our lives and wonder if we could have been better made better decisions or used our time more wisely To avoid some of the deepest regrets of life it would be wise to make some resolutions today Therefore let us Resolve to spend more time with those we love Resolve to strive more earnestly to become the person God wants us to be Resolve to find happiness regardless of our circumstances It is my testimony that many of the deepest regrets of tomorrow can be prevented by following the Savior today If we have sinned or made mistakes if we have made choices that we now regret there is the precious gift of Christ s Atonement through which we can be forgiven We cannot go back in time and change the past but we can repent The Savior can wipe away our tears of regret11 and remove the burden of our sins 12 His Atonement allows us to leave the past behind and move forward with clean hands a pure heart 13 and a determination to do better and especially to become better Yes this life is passing swiftly our days seem to fade quickly and death appears frightening at times Nevertheless our spirit will continue to live and will one day be united with our resurrected body to receive immortal glory I bear solemn witness that because of the merciful Christ we will all live again and forever Because of our Savior and Redeemer one day we will truly understand and rejoice in the meaning of the words the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ 14The path toward fulfilling our divine destiny as sons and daughters of God is an eternal one My dear brothers and sisters dear friends we must begin to walk that eternal path today we cannot take for granted one single day I pray that we will not wait until we are ready to die before we truly learn to live In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen

I cherish this wonderful opportunity to meet with the brethren of the priesthood and rejoice with you in the wonder and beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ I commend you for your faith your good works and your abiding righteousness We share a common bond in that we have all received the ordination to the priesthood of God from those trusted with holy priesthood authority and power This is no small blessing It is a sacred responsibility The Power of WhyRecently I have been thinking about two significant callings I received as a priesthood holder in the Church The first of these callings came when I was a deacon I attended with my family the branch of the Church in Frankfurt Germany We were blessed with many wonderful people in our little branch One was our branch president Brother Landschulz I admired him a great deal even though he always seemed to be rather serious very official and most of the time dressed in a dark suit I remember as a young man joking with my friends how old fashioned our branch president appeared It makes me laugh to think about this now because it is very possible that the youth of the Church today view me in a very similar way One Sunday President Landschulz asked if he could speak with me My first thought was What did I do wrong My mind raced over the many things I might have done that could have inspired this branch president to deacon talk President Landschulz invited me into a small classroom our chapel did not have an office for the branch president and there he extended a call to me to serve as deacons quorum president This is an important position he said and then he took his time and described why He explained what he and the Lord expected of me and how I could receive help I don t remember much of what he said but I do remember well how I felt A sacred divine Spirit filled my heart as he spoke I could feel that this was the Savior s Church And I felt that the calling he had extended was inspired by the Holy Ghost I remember walking out of that tiny classroom feeling quite a bit taller than before It has been nearly 60 years since that day and I still treasure these feelings of trust and love As I was thinking back on this experience I tried to remember just how many deacons there were in our branch at the time To my best recollection I believe there were two However this may be a huge exaggeration But it really didn t matter whether there was one deacon or a dozen I felt honored and I wanted to serve to the best of my ability and not disappoint either my branch president or the Lord I realize now that the branch president could have merely gone through the motions when he called me to this position He could have simply told me in the hallway or during our priesthood meeting that I was the new deacons quorum president Instead he spent time with me and helped me understand not only the what of my assignment and new responsibility but much more important the why That is something I will never forget The point of this story is not merely to describe how to extend callings in the Church although this was a wonderful lesson on the proper way to do it It is an example to me of the motivating power of priesthood leadership that awakens the spirit and inspires action We need to be constantly reminded of the eternal reasons behind the things we are commanded to do The basic gospel principles need to be part of our life s fabric even if it means learning them over and over again That doesn t mean that this process should be rote or boring Rather when we teach the foundational principles in our homes or in church let the flame of enthusiasm for the gospel and the fire of testimony bring light warmth and joy to the hearts of those we teach From the newest ordained deacon to the most senior high priest we all have lists of what we could and should do in our priesthood responsibilities The what is important in our work and we need to attend to it But it is in the why of priesthood service that we discover the fire passion and power of the priesthood The what of priesthood service teaches us what to do The why inspires our souls The what informs but the why transforms An Abundance of Good Things to DoAnother priesthood calling that I have been thinking about came to me many years later when I had my own family We had moved back to Frankfurt Germany and I had just received a promotion at work that would require a great deal of my time and attention During this busy season of my life Elder Joseph B Wirthlin extended a call to me to serve as stake president During my interview with him many thoughts raced through my mind not the least of which was the unsettling worry that I might not have the time this calling would require Although I felt humbled and honored by the call I briefly wondered if I could accept it But it was only a fleeting thought because I knew that Elder Wirthlin was called of God and that he was doing the Lord s work What could I do but accept There are times when we have to step into the darkness in faith confident that God will place solid ground beneath our feet once we do And so I accepted gladly knowing that God would provide In the early days of this assignment we were privileged as a stake to receive training from some of the greatest teachers and leaders in the Church men like Elder Russell M Nelson and President Thomas S Monson came to our area Their teaching was like the dew from heaven and an inspiration for us I still have the notes I took during these training sessions These Brethren gave us the vision of what it means to establish the kingdom of God by building personal testimonies and strengthening families They helped us see how to apply gospel truth and principles to our specific circumstances and for our specific time To put it another way inspired leaders helped us to see the why of the gospel and then we had to roll up our sleeves and go to work It wasn t long before we realized that there were a lot of things a stake presidency could do so many in fact that if we didn t set inspired priorities we might miss doing the important ones Competing priorities began to arise deflecting our focus from the vision shared by the Brethren There were many good things to do but not all of them mattered most We learned an important lesson the fact that something is good is not always reason enough to require our time and resources Our activities initiatives and plans should be inspired by and grounded upon the why of our priesthood service and not by any flashy trend or interest of the moment Otherwise they can distract our efforts dilute our energy and get us caught up in our own hobbies spiritual or temporal that are not at the center of discipleship Brethren we all know that it takes self discipline to remain focused on the matters that have the greatest power to increase our love for God and fellowman invigorate marriages strengthen families and build the kingdom of God on earth Like a fruit tree with an abundance of branches and leaves our lives need regular pruning to ensure that we use our energy and time to accomplish our real purpose to bring forth good fruit 1You Are Not AloneSo how do we know what to select We each have the responsibility to determine this for ourselves However we are commanded to diligently study the scriptures heed the words of the prophets and make it a matter of faith filled serious dedicated prayer Brethren God is faithful Through the Holy Spirit He will speak to our minds and hearts concerning the path we should follow during each segment of our lives If our hearts are pure if we seek not our own glory but the glory of Almighty God if we seek to do His will if we desire to bless the lives of our family and fellowman we will not be left to walk alone As President Monson has often reminded us When we are on the Lord s errand we are entitled to the Lord s help 2Your Heavenly Father will go before your face He will be on your right hand and on your left and His Spirit shall be in your hearts and His angels round about you to bear you up 3The Power of DoingMy dear brethren divine blessings for priesthood service are activated by our diligent efforts our willingness to sacrifice and our desire to do what is right Let us be the ones to act and not be acted upon Preaching is fine but sermons that do not lead to action are like fires without heat or water that cannot quench thirst It is in the application of doctrine that the purifying flame of the gospel grows and the power of the priesthood ignites our souls Thomas Edison the man who bathed the world in glowing electric light said that the value of an idea lies in the using of it 4 In a similar way gospel doctrine becomes more precious when it is put to use We must not allow the doctrines of the priesthood to lie dormant in our hearts and unapplied in our lives If there is a marriage or family in need of rescue perhaps even our own let s not just wait and see Rather let us thank God for the plan of happiness that includes faith repentance forgiveness and new beginnings Applying priesthood doctrine will qualify us as husbands as fathers as sons who understand the why of the priesthood and its power to recapture and secure the beauty and holiness of eternal families General conference is always a good time for both hearing and doing Therefore let us be doers of the word and not hearers only 5 Brethren I invite you to consider the words spoken by the servants of God this weekend Then get on your knees Ask God our Heavenly Father to enlighten your mind and touch your heart Plead with God for guidance in your daily lives in your Church responsibilities and in your specific challenges at this time Follow the promptings of the Spirit do not delay If you do all this I promise that the Lord will not leave you to walk alone Continue in PatienceWe know that despite our best intentions things do not always go according to plan We make mistakes in life and in our priesthood service Occasionally we stumble and fall short When the Lord advises us to continue in patience until we are perfected 6 He is acknowledging that it takes time and perseverance Understanding the why of the gospel and the why of the priesthood will help us to see the divine purpose of all of this It will give us motivation and strength to do the right things even when they are hard Staying focused on the basic principles of gospel living will bless us with clarity wisdom and direction Shall we not go on in so great a cause 7 Yes brethren we will Guided by the Holy Spirit we will learn from our mistakes If we stumble we will rise If we falter we will go on We will never waver we will never give up As a mighty brotherhood of the everlasting priesthood of God we will stand together shoulder to shoulder focused on the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and gratefully serving our God and fellowman with dedication and love God Lives My dear brethren I testify to you this day that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ live They are real They are there You are not alone Your Father in Heaven cares about you and desires to bless and uphold you in righteousness Be assured that God speaks to mankind in our time He will speak to you The Prophet Joseph Smith saw what he said he saw The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is restored to earth by the power and authority of Almighty God My prayer is that as bearers of His priesthood we will ever stay attuned to the why of priesthood service and use the principles of the restored gospel to transform our lives and the lives of those whom we serve As we do so the infinite power of the Atonement will purify cleanse and refine our spirits and characters until we become the men we are meant to become Of this I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters not long ago I received a letter from a concerned mother who pleaded for a general conference talk on a topic that would specifically benefit her two children A rift had grown between them and they had stopped speaking to each other The mother was heartbroken In the letter she assured me that a general conference message on this topic would reconcile her children and all would be well This good sister s sincere and heartfelt plea was just one of several promptings I have received over these last months that I should say a few words today on a topic that is a growing concern not only for a worried mother but for many in the Church and indeed the world I am impressed by the faith of this loving mother that a general conference talk could help heal the relationship between her children I am sure that her confidence was not so much in the abilities of the speakers but in the virtue of the word of God which has a more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than anything else 1 Dear sister I pray that the Spirit will touch your children s hearts When Relationships Go BadStrained and broken relationships are as old as humankind itself Ancient Cain was the first who allowed the cancer of bitterness and malice to canker his heart He tilled the ground of his soul with envy and hatred and allowed these feelings to ripen until he did the unthinkable murdering his own brother and becoming in the process the father of Satan s lies 2Since those first days the spirit of envy and hatred has led to some of the most tragic stories in history It turned Saul against David the sons of Jacob against their brother Joseph Laman and Lemuel against Nephi and Amalickiah against Moroni I imagine that every person on earth has been affected in some way by the destructive spirit of contention resentment and revenge Perhaps there are even times when we recognize this spirit in ourselves When we feel hurt angry or envious it is quite easy to judge other people often assigning dark motives to their actions in order to justify our own feelings of resentment The DoctrineOf course we know this is wrong The doctrine is clear We all depend on the Savior none of us can be saved without Him Christ s Atonement is infinite and eternal Forgiveness for our sins comes with conditions We must repent and we must be willing to forgive others Jesus taught Forgive one another for he that forgiveth not stands condemned before the Lord for there remaineth in him the greater sin 3 and Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy 4Of course these words seem perfectly reasonable when applied to someone else We can so clearly and easily see the harmful results that come when others judge and hold grudges And we certainly don t like it when people judge us But when it comes to our own prejudices and grievances we too often justify our anger as righteous and our judgment as reliable and only appropriate Though we cannot look into another s heart we assume that we know a bad motive or even a bad person when we see one We make exceptions when it comes to our own bitterness because we feel that in our case we have all the information we need to hold someone else in contempt The Apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans said that those who pass judgment on others are inexcusable The moment we judge someone else he explained we condemn ourselves for none is without sin 5 Refusing to forgive is a grievous sin one the Savior warned against Jesus s own disciples had sought occasion against each other and forgave not one another in their hearts and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened 6Our Savior has spoken so clearly on this subject that there is little room for private interpretation I the Lord will forgive whom I will forgive but then He said of you it is required to forgive all men 7May I add a footnote here When the Lord requires that we forgive all men that includes forgiving ourselves Sometimes of all the people in the world the one who is the hardest to forgive as well as perhaps the one who is most in need of our forgiveness is the person looking back at us in the mirror The Bottom LineThis topic of judging others could actually be taught in a two word sermon When it comes to hating gossiping ignoring ridiculing holding grudges or wanting to cause harm please apply the following Stop it It s that simple We simply have to stop judging others and replace judgmental thoughts and feelings with a heart full of love for God and His children God is our Father We are His children We are all brothers and sisters I don t know exactly how to articulate this point of not judging others with sufficient eloquence passion and persuasion to make it stick I can quote scripture I can try to expound doctrine and I will even quote a bumper sticker I recently saw It was attached to the back of a car whose driver appeared to be a little rough around the edges but the words on the sticker taught an insightful lesson It read Don t judge me because I sin differently than you We must recognize that we are all imperfect that we are beggars before God Haven t we all at one time or another meekly approached the mercy seat and pleaded for grace Haven t we wished with all the energy of our souls for mercy to be forgiven for the mistakes we have made and the sins we have committed Because we all depend on the mercy of God how can we deny to others any measure of the grace we so desperately desire for ourselves My beloved brothers and sisters should we not forgive as we wish to be forgiven The Love of GodIs this difficult to do Yes of course Forgiving ourselves and others is not easy In fact for most of us it requires a major change in our attitude and way of thinking even a change of heart But there is good news This mighty change 8 of heart is exactly what the gospel of Jesus Christ is designed to bring into our lives How is it done Through the love of God When our hearts are filled with the love of God something good and pure happens to us We keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world 9The more we allow the love of God to govern our minds and emotions the more we allow our love for our Heavenly Father to swell within our hearts the easier it is to love others with the pure love of Christ As we open our hearts to the glowing dawn of the love of God the darkness and cold of animosity and envy will eventually fade As always Christ is our exemplar In His teachings as in His life He showed us the way He forgave the wicked the vulgar and those who sought to hurt and to do Him harm Jesus said it is easy to love those who love us even the wicked can do that But Jesus Christ taught a higher law His words echo through the centuries and are meant for us today They are meant for all who desire to be His disciples They are meant for you and me Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you 10When our hearts are filled with the love of God we become kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving each other even as God for Christ s sake forgave us 11The pure love of Christ can remove the scales of resentment and wrath from our eyes allowing us to see others the way our Heavenly Father sees us as flawed and imperfect mortals who have potential and worth far beyond our capacity to imagine Because God loves us so much we too must love and forgive each other The Way of the DiscipleMy dear brothers and sisters consider the following questions as a self test Do you harbor a grudge against someone else Do you gossip even when what you say may be true Do you exclude push away or punish others because of something they have done Do you secretly envy another Do you wish to cause harm to someone If you answered yes to any of these questions you may want to apply the two word sermon from earlier stop it In a world of accusations and unfriendliness it is easy to gather and cast stones But before we do so let us remember the words of the One who is our Master and model He that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone 12Brothers and sisters let us put down our stones Let us be kind Let us forgive Let us talk peacefully with each other Let the love of God fill our hearts Let us do good unto all men 13The Savior promised Give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over For with the same measure that you use it shall be measured to you again 14Shouldn t this promise be enough to always focus our efforts on acts of kindness forgiveness and charity instead of on any negative behavior Let us as disciples of Jesus Christ return good for evil 15 Let us not seek revenge or allow our wrath to overcome us For it is written Vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord Therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink Be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good 16Remember in the end it is the merciful who obtain mercy 17As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints wherever we may be let us be known as a people who have love one to another 18Love One AnotherBrothers and sisters there is enough heartache and sorrow in this life without our adding to it through our own stubbornness bitterness and resentment We are not perfect The people around us are not perfect 19 People do things that annoy disappoint and anger In this mortal life it will always be that way Nevertheless we must let go of our grievances Part of the purpose of mortality is to learn how to let go of such things That is the Lord s way Remember heaven is filled with those who have this in common They are forgiven And they forgive Lay your burden at the Savior s feet Let go of judgment Allow Christ s Atonement to change and heal your heart Love one another Forgive one another The merciful will obtain mercy Of this I testify in the name of the One who loved so well and so completely that He gave His life for us His friends in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Moses one of the greatest prophets the world has ever known was raised by Pharaoh s daughter and spent the first 40 years of his life in the royal halls of Egypt He knew firsthand the glory and grandeur of that ancient kingdom Years later on the top of a distant mountain far removed from the splendor and magnificence of mighty Egypt Moses stood in the presence of God and spoke to Him face to face as a man speaks with his friend 1 During the course of that visitation God showed Moses the workmanship of His hands granting him a glimpse of His work and glory When the vision ended Moses fell to the earth for the space of many hours When his strength finally returned he realized something that in all his years in Pharaoh s court had never occurred to him before I know he said that man is nothing 2We Are Less Than We SupposeThe more we learn about the universe the more we understand at least in a small part what Moses knew The universe is so large mysterious and glorious that it is incomprehensible to the human mind Worlds without number have I created God said to Moses 3 The wonders of the night sky are a beautiful testimony of that truth There are few things that have filled me with such breathless awe as flying in the black of night across oceans and continents and looking out my cockpit window upon the infinite glory of millions of stars Astronomers have attempted to count the number of stars in the universe One group of scientists estimates that the number of stars within range of our telescopes is 10 times greater than all the grains of sand on the world s beaches and deserts 4This conclusion has a striking similarity to the declaration of the ancient prophet Enoch Were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth yea millions of earths like this it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations 5Given the vastness of God s creations it s no wonder the great King Benjamin counseled his people to always retain in remembrance the greatness of God and your own nothingness 6We Are Greater Than We SupposeBut even though man is nothing it fills me with wonder and awe to think that the worth of souls is great in the sight of God 7And while we may look at the vast expanse of the universe and say What is man in comparison to the glory of creation God Himself said we are the reason He created the universe His work and glory the purpose for this magnificent universe is to save and exalt mankind 8 In other words the vast expanse of eternity the glories and mysteries of infinite space and time are all built for the benefit of ordinary mortals like you and me Our Heavenly Father created the universe that we might reach our potential as His sons and daughters This is a paradox of man compared to God man is nothing yet we are everything to God While against the backdrop of infinite creation we may appear to be nothing we have a spark of eternal fire burning within our breast We have the incomprehensible promise of exaltation worlds without end within our grasp And it is God s great desire to help us reach it The Folly of PrideThe great deceiver knows that one of his most effective tools in leading the children of God astray is to appeal to the extremes of the paradox of man To some he appeals to their prideful tendencies puffing them up and encouraging them to believe in the fantasy of their own self importance and invincibility He tells them they have transcended the ordinary and that because of ability birthright or social status they are set apart from the common measure of all that surrounds them He leads them to conclude that they are therefore not subject to anyone else s rules and not to be bothered by anyone else s problems Abraham Lincoln is said to have loved a poem that reads Oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud Like a swift flitting meteor a fast flying cloud A flash of the lightning a break of the wave Man passeth from life to his rest in the grave 9Disciples of Jesus Christ understand that compared to eternity our existence in this mortal sphere is only a small moment in space and time 10 They know that a person s true value has little to do with what the world holds in high esteem They know you could pile up the accumulated currency of the entire world and it could not buy a loaf of bread in the economy of heaven Those who will inherit the kingdom of God 11 are those who become as a child submissive meek humble patient full of love 12 For every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted 13 Such disciples understand also that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God 14We Are Not ForgottenAnother way Satan deceives is through discouragement He attempts to focus our sight on our own insignificance until we begin to doubt that we have much worth He tells us that we are too small for anyone to take notice that we are forgotten especially by God Let me share with you a personal experience that may be of some help to those who feel insignificant forgotten or alone Many years ago I attended pilot training in the United States Air Force I was far away from my home a young West German soldier born in Czechoslovakia who had grown up in East Germany and spoke English only with great difficulty I clearly remember my journey to our training base in Texas I was on a plane sitting next to a passenger who spoke with a heavy Southern accent I could scarcely understand a word he said I actually wondered if I had been taught the wrong language all along I was terrified by the thought that I had to compete for the coveted top spots in pilot training against students who were native English speakers When I arrived on the air base in the small town of Big Spring Texas I looked for and found the Latter day Saint branch which consisted of a handful of wonderful members who were meeting in rented rooms on the air base itself The members were in the process of building a small meetinghouse that would serve as a permanent place for the Church Back in those days members provided much of the labor on new buildings Day after day I attended my pilot training and studied as hard as I could and then spent most of my spare time working on the new meetinghouse There I learned that a two by four is not a dance step but a piece of wood I also learned the important survival skill of missing my thumb when pounding a nail I spent so much time working on the meetinghouse that the branch president who also happened to be one of our flight instructors expressed concern that I perhaps should spend more time studying My friends and fellow student pilots engaged themselves in free time activities as well although I think it s safe to say that some of those activities would not have been in alignment with today s For the Strength of Youth pamphlet For my part I enjoyed being an active part of this tiny west Texas branch practicing my newly acquired carpentry skills and improving my English as I fulfilled my callings to teach in the elders quorum and in Sunday School At the time Big Spring despite its name was a small insignificant and unknown place And I often felt exactly the same way about myself insignificant unknown and quite alone Even so I never once wondered if the Lord had forgotten me or if He would ever be able to find me there I knew that it didn t matter to Heavenly Father where I was where I ranked with others in my pilot training class or what my calling in the Church was What mattered to Him was that I was doing the best I could that my heart was inclined toward Him and that I was willing to help those around me I knew if I did the best I could all would be well And all was well 15The Last Shall Be FirstThe Lord doesn t care at all if we spend our days working in marble halls or stable stalls He knows where we are no matter how humble our circumstances He will use in His own way and for His holy purposes those who incline their hearts to Him God knows that some of the greatest souls who have ever lived are those who will never appear in the chronicles of history They are the blessed humble souls who emulate the Savior s example and spend the days of their lives doing good 16One such couple parents of a friend of mine exemplify this principle for me The husband worked at a steel mill in Utah At lunch he would pull out his scriptures or a Church magazine and read When the other workers saw this they ridiculed him and challenged his beliefs Whenever they did he spoke to them with kindness and confidence He did not allow their disrespect to make him angry or upset Years later one of the more vocal mockers became very ill Before he died he requested that this humble man speak at his funeral which he did This faithful member of the Church never had much in the way of social status or wealth but his influence extended deeply to all who knew him He died in an industrial accident while stopping to help another worker who was stranded in the snow Within a year his widow had to undergo brain surgery which has left her unable to walk But people love coming to spend time with her because she listens She remembers She cares Unable to write she memorizes her children s and grandchildren s telephone numbers She lovingly remembers birthdays and anniversaries Those who visit her come away feeling better about life and about themselves They feel her love They know she cares She never complains but spends her days blessing the lives of others One of her friends said this woman was one of the few people she had ever known who truly exemplifies the love and life of Jesus Christ This couple would have been the first to say they were not of much importance in this world But the Lord uses a scale very different from the world s to weigh the worth of a soul He knows this faithful couple He loves them Their actions are a living witness of their strong faith in Him You Matter to HimMy dear brothers and sisters it may be true that man is nothing in comparison to the greatness of the universe At times we may even feel insignificant invisible alone or forgotten But always remember you matter to Him If you ever doubt that consider these four divine principles First God loves the humble and meek for they are greatest in the kingdom of heaven 17Second the Lord entrusts the fulness of His gospel to be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world 18 He has chosen the weak things of the world to come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones 19 and to put to shame the things which are mighty 20Third no matter where you live no matter how humble your circumstances how meager your employment how limited your abilities how ordinary your appearance or how little your calling in the Church may appear to you you are not invisible to your Heavenly Father He loves you He knows your humble heart and your acts of love and kindness Together they form a lasting testimony of your fidelity and faith Fourth and finally please understand that what you see and experience now is not what forever will be You will not feel loneliness sorrow pain or discouragement forever We have the faithful promise of God that He will neither forget nor forsake those who incline their hearts to Him 21 Have hope and faith in that promise Learn to love your Heavenly Father and become His disciple in word and in deed Be assured that if you but hold on believe in Him and remain faithful in keeping the commandments one day you will experience for yourselves the promises revealed to the Apostle Paul Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 22Brothers and sisters the most powerful Being in the universe is the Father of your spirit He knows you He loves you with a perfect love God sees you not only as a mortal being on a small planet who lives for a brief season He sees you as His child He sees you as the being you are capable and designed to become He wants you to know that you matter to Him May we ever believe trust and align our lives so that we will understand our true eternal worth and potential May we be worthy of the precious blessings our Heavenly Father has in store for us is my prayer in the name of His Son even Jesus Christ amen 
My dear sisters what a joy it is to be with you today I always look forward to this annual general Relief Society meeting and the excellent messages given here Thank you sisters It is a precious honor for me to be assigned by President Thomas S Monson to speak today and to add a few thoughts addressing the sisters of the Church A while ago I was walking through a beautiful garden with my wife and daughter I marveled at the glory and beauty of God s creation And then I noticed among all the glorious blooms the tiniest flower I knew the name of this flower because since I was a child I have had a tender connection to it The flower is called forget me not I m not exactly sure why this tiny flower has meant so much to me over the years It does not attract immediate attention it is easy to overlook among larger and more vibrant flowers yet it is just as beautiful with its rich color that mirrors that of the bluest skies perhaps this is one reason why I like it so much And there is the haunting plea of its name There is a German legend that just as God had finished naming all the plants one was left unnamed A tiny voice spoke out Forget me not O Lord And God replied that this would be its name Tonight I would like to use this little flower as a metaphor The five petals of the little forget me not flower prompt me to consider five things we would be wise never to forget First forget not to be patient with yourself I want to tell you something that I hope you will take in the right way God is fully aware that you and I are not perfect Let me add God is also fully aware that the people you think are perfect are not And yet we spend so much time and energy comparing ourselves to others usually comparing our weaknesses to their strengths This drives us to create expectations for ourselves that are impossible to meet As a result we never celebrate our good efforts because they seem to be less than what someone else does Everyone has strengths and weaknesses It s wonderful that you have strengths And it is part of your mortal experience that you do have weaknesses God wants to help us to eventually turn all of our weaknesses into strengths 1 but He knows that this is a long term goal He wants us to become perfect 2 and if we stay on the path of discipleship one day we will It s OK that you re not quite there yet Keep working on it but stop punishing yourself Dear sisters many of you are endlessly compassionate and patient with the weaknesses of others Please remember also to be compassionate and patient with yourself In the meantime be thankful for all the small successes in your home your family relationships your education and livelihood your Church participation and personal improvement Like the forget me nots these successes may seem tiny to you and they may go unnoticed by others but God notices them and they are not small to Him If you consider success to be only the most perfect rose or dazzling orchid you may miss some of life s sweetest experiences For example insisting that you have a picture perfect family home evening each week even though doing so makes you and everyone around you miserable may not be the best choice Instead ask yourself What could we do as a family that would be enjoyable and spiritual and bring us closer together That family home evening though it may be modest in scope and execution may have far more positive long term results Our journey toward perfection is long but we can find wonder and delight in even the tiniest steps in that journey Second forget not the difference between a good sacrifice and a foolish sacrifice An acceptable sacrifice is when we give up something good for something of far greater worth Giving up a little sleep to help a child who is having a nightmare is a good sacrifice We all know this Staying up all night jeopardizing our own health to make the perfect accessory for a daughter s Sunday outfit may not be such a good sacrifice Dedicating some of our time to studying the scriptures or preparing to teach a lesson is a good sacrifice Spending many hours stitching the title of the lesson into homemade pot holders for each member of your class perhaps may not be Every person and situation is different and a good sacrifice in one instance might be a foolish sacrifice in another How can we tell the difference for our own situation We can ask ourselves Am I committing my time and energies to the things that matter most There are so many good things to do but we can t do all of them Our Heavenly Father is most pleased when we sacrifice something good for something far greater with an eternal perspective Sometimes that may even mean nurturing small but beautiful forget me not flowers instead of a large garden of exotic blooms Third forget not to be happy now In the beloved children s story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the mysterious candy maker Willy Wonka hides a golden ticket in five of his candy bars and announces that whoever finds one of the tickets wins a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate Written on each golden ticket is this message Greetings to you the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket Tremendous things are in store for you Many wonderful surprises await you Mystic and marvelous surprises will delight astonish and perplex you 3In this classic children s story people all over the world desperately yearn to find a golden ticket Some feel that their entire future happiness depends on whether or not a golden ticket falls into their hands In their anxiousness people begin to forget the simple joy they used to find in a candy bar The candy bar itself becomes an utter disappointment if it does not contain a golden ticket So many people today are waiting for their own golden ticket the ticket that they believe holds the key to the happiness they have always dreamed about For some the golden ticket may be a perfect marriage for others a magazine cover home or perhaps freedom from stress or worry There is nothing wrong with righteous yearnings we hope and seek after things that are virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy 4 The problem comes when we put our happiness on hold as we wait for some future event our golden ticket to appear One woman wanted more than anything else to marry a righteous priesthood holder in the temple and be a mother and a wife She had dreamed about this all her life and oh what a wonderful mother and loving wife she would be Her home would be filled with loving kindness Never a bitter word would be spoken The food would never burn And her children instead of hanging out with their friends would prefer to spend their evenings and weekends with Mom and Dad This was her golden ticket It was the one thing upon which she felt her whole existence depended It was the one thing in all the world for which she most desperately yearned But it never happened And as the years went on she became more and more withdrawn bitter and even angry She could not understand why God would not grant her this righteous desire She worked as an elementary school teacher and being around children all day long simply reminded her that her golden ticket had never appeared As the years passed she became more disappointed and withdrawn People didn t like being around her and avoided her whenever they could She even took her frustration out on the children at school She found herself losing her temper and she swung between fits of anger and desperate loneliness The tragedy of this story is that this dear woman in all her disappointment about her golden ticket failed to notice the blessings she did have She did not have children in her home but she was surrounded by them in her classroom She was not blessed with a family but the Lord had given her an opportunity few people have the chance to influence for good the lives of hundreds of children and families as a teacher The lesson here is that if we spend our days waiting for fabulous roses we could miss the beauty and wonder of the tiny forget me nots that are all around us This is not to say that we should abandon hope or temper our goals Never stop striving for the best that is within you Never stop hoping for all of the righteous desires of your heart But don t close your eyes and hearts to the simple and elegant beauties of each day s ordinary moments that make up a rich well lived life The happiest people I know are not those who find their golden ticket they are those who while in pursuit of worthy goals discover and treasure the beauty and sweetness of the everyday moments They are the ones who thread by daily thread weave a tapestry of gratitude and wonder throughout their lives These are they who are truly happy Fourth forget not the why of the gospel Sometimes in the routine of our lives we unintentionally overlook a vital aspect of the gospel of Jesus Christ much as one might overlook a beautiful delicate forget me not In our diligent efforts to fulfill all of the duties and obligations we take on as members of the Church we sometimes see the gospel as a long list of tasks that we must add to our already impossibly long to do list as a block of time that we must somehow fit into our busy schedules We focus on what the Lord wants us to do and how we might do it but we sometimes forget why My dear sisters the gospel of Jesus Christ is not an obligation it is a pathway marked by our loving Father in Heaven leading to happiness and peace in this life and glory and inexpressible fulfillment in the life to come The gospel is a light that penetrates mortality and illuminates the way before us While understanding the what and the how of the gospel is necessary the eternal fire and majesty of the gospel springs from the why When we understand why our Heavenly Father has given us this pattern for living when we remember why we committed to making it a foundational part of our lives the gospel ceases to become a burden and instead becomes a joy and a delight It becomes precious and sweet Let us not walk the path of discipleship with our eyes on the ground thinking only of the tasks and obligations before us Let us not walk unaware of the beauty of the glorious earthly and spiritual landscapes that surround us My dear sisters seek out the majesty the beauty and the exhilarating joy of the why of the gospel of Jesus Christ The what and how of obedience mark the way and keep us on the right path The why of obedience sanctifies our actions transforming the mundane into the majestic It magnifies our small acts of obedience into holy acts of consecration Fifth forget not that the Lord loves you As a child when I would look at the little forget me nots I sometimes felt a little like that flower small and insignificant I wondered if I would be forgotten by my family or by my Heavenly Father Years later I can look back on that young boy with tenderness and compassion And I do know now I was never forgotten And I know something else as an Apostle of our Master Jesus Christ I proclaim with all the certainty and conviction of my heart neither are you You are not forgotten Sisters wherever you are whatever your circumstances may be you are not forgotten No matter how dark your days may seem no matter how insignificant you may feel no matter how overshadowed you think you may be your Heavenly Father has not forgotten you In fact He loves you with an infinite love Just think of it You are known and remembered by the most majestic powerful and glorious Being in the universe You are loved by the King of infinite space and everlasting time He who created and knows the stars knows you and your name you are the daughters of His kingdom The Psalmist wrote When I consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained What is man that thou art mindful of him For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour 5God loves you because you are His child He loves you even though at times you may feel lonely or make mistakes The love of God and the power of the restored gospel are redemptive and saving If you will only allow His divine love into your life it can dress any wound heal any hurt and soften any sorrow My dear Relief Society sisters you are closer to heaven than you suppose You are destined for more than you can possibly imagine Continue to increase in faith and personal righteousness Accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as your way of life Cherish the gift of activity in this great and true Church Treasure the gift of service in the blessed organization of Relief Society Continue to strengthen homes and families Continue to seek out and help others who need your and the Lord s help Sisters there is something inspiring and sublime about the little forget me not flower I hope it will be a symbol of the little things that make your lives joyful and sweet Please never forget that you must be patient and compassionate with yourselves that some sacrifices are better than others that you need not wait for a golden ticket to be happy Please never forget that the why of the gospel of Jesus Christ will inspire and uplift you And never forget that your Heavenly Father knows loves and cherishes you Thank you for who you are Thank you for the countless acts of love and service you offer up to so many Thank you for all that you will yet do to bring the joy of the gospel of Jesus Christ to families to the Church to your communities and to the nations of the world Sisters we love you It is my prayer and blessing that you will never forget that you are truly precious daughters in God s kingdom in the sacred name of our beloved Savior Jesus Christ amen 
Sixty five years ago shortly after World War II I experienced firsthand the blessings of the welfare program of the Church Even though I was a young child I still remember the sweet taste of canned peaches with cooked wheat and the special smell of the donated clothing sent to the postwar German Saints by caring Church members from the United States I will never forget and I will always cherish these acts of love and kindness to those of us who were in great need This personal experience and the 75th anniversary of the inspired welfare plan give me reason to reflect again on the basic principles of caring for the poor and needy becoming self reliant and serving our fellowman At the Root of Our FaithSometimes we see welfare as simply another gospel topic one of the many branches on the gospel tree But I believe that in the Lord s plan our commitment to welfare principles should be at the very root of our faith and devotion to Him Since the beginning of time our Heavenly Father has spoken with great clarity on this subject from the gentle plea If thou lovest me thou wilt remember the poor and consecrate of thy properties for their support 1 to the direct command Remember in all things the poor and the needy the sick and the afflicted for he that doeth not these things the same is not my disciple 2 to the forceful warning If any man shall take of the abundance which I have made and impart not his portion according to the law of my gospel unto the poor and the needy he shall with the wicked lift up his eyes in hell being in torment 3The Temporal and Spiritual Are Bound TogetherThe two great commandments to love God and our neighbor are a joining of the temporal and the spiritual It is important to note that these two commandments are called great because every other commandment hangs upon them 4 In other words our personal family and Church priorities must begin here All other goals and actions should spring from the fountain of these two great commandments from our love for God and for our neighbor Like two sides of a coin the temporal and spiritual are inseparable The Giver of all life has proclaimed All things unto me are spiritual and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal 5 This means to me that spiritual life is first of all a life It is not merely something to be known and studied it is to be lived 6Unfortunately there are those who overlook the temporal because they consider it less important They treasure the spiritual while minimizing the temporal While it is important to have our thoughts inclined toward heaven we miss the essence of our religion if our hands are not also inclined toward our fellowman For example Enoch built a Zion society through the spiritual process of creating a people of one heart and one mind and the temporal work of ensuring that there were no poor among them 7As always we can look to our perfect example Jesus Christ for a pattern As President J Reuben Clark Jr taught When the Savior came upon the earth he had two great missions one was to work out the Messiahship the atonement for the fall and the fulfilment of the law the other was the work which he did among his brethren and sisters in the flesh by way of relieving their sufferings 8In a similar way our spiritual progress is inseparably bound together with the temporal service we give to others The one complements the other The one without the other is a counterfeit of God s plan of happiness The Lord s WayThere are many good people and organizations in the world that are trying to meet the pressing needs of the poor and needy everywhere We are grateful for this but the Lord s way of caring for the needy is different from the world s way The Lord has said It must needs be done in mine own way 9 He is not only interested in our immediate needs He is also concerned about our eternal progression For this reason the Lord s way has always included self reliance and service to our neighbor in addition to caring for the poor In 1941 the Gila River overflowed and flooded the Duncan Valley in Arizona A young stake president by the name of Spencer W Kimball met with his counselors assessed the damage and sent a telegram to Salt Lake City asking for a large sum of money Instead of sending money President Heber J Grant sent three men Henry D Moyle Marion G Romney and Harold B Lee They visited with President Kimball and taught him an important lesson This isn t a program of give me they said This is a program of self help Many years later President Kimball said It would have been an easy thing I think for the Brethren to have sent us the money and it wouldn t have been too hard to sit in my office and distribute it but what a lot of good came to us as we had hundreds of our own go to Duncan and build fences and haul the hay and level the ground and do all the things that needed doing That is self help 10By following the Lord s way the members of President Kimball s stake not only had their immediate needs met but they also developed self reliance alleviated suffering and grew in love and unity as they served each other We Are All EnlistedThis very hour there are many members of the Church who are suffering They are hungry stretched financially and struggling with all manner of physical emotional and spiritual distress They pray with all the energy of their souls for succor for relief Brethren please do not think that this is someone else s responsibility It is mine and it is yours We are all enlisted All means all every Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood holder rich and poor in every nation In the Lord s plan there is something everyone can contribute 11The lesson we learn generation after generation is that rich and poor are all under the same sacred obligation to help their neighbor It will take all of us working together to successfully apply the principles of welfare and self reliance Too often we notice the needs around us hoping that someone from far away will magically appear to meet those needs Perhaps we wait for experts with specialized knowledge to solve specific problems When we do this we deprive our neighbor of the service we could render and we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to serve While there is nothing wrong with experts let s face it there will never be enough of them to solve all the problems Instead the Lord has placed His priesthood and its organization at our doorsteps in every nation where the Church is established And right by its side He has placed the Relief Society As we priesthood holders know no welfare effort is successful if it fails to make use of the remarkable gifts and talents of our sisters The Lord s way is not to sit at the side of the stream and wait for the water to pass before we cross It is to come together roll up our sleeves go to work and build a bridge or a boat to cross the waters of our challenges You men of Zion you priesthood holders are the ones who can lead out and bring relief to the Saints by applying the inspired principles of the welfare program It is your mission to open your eyes use your priesthood and go to work in the Lord s way The Greatest Organization on EarthDuring the Great Depression Harold B Lee serving then as a stake president was asked by the Brethren to find an answer to the oppressive poverty sorrow and hunger that were so widespread across the world at that time He struggled to find a solution and took the matter to the Lord and asked What kind of an organization will we have to do this And it was as though the Lord had said to him Look son You don t need any other organization I have given you the greatest organization there is on the face of the earth Nothing is greater than the priesthood organization All in the world you need to do is to put the priesthood to work That s all 12That is the starting point in our time as well We already have the Lord s organization in place Our challenge is determining how to use it The place to begin is to familiarize ourselves with what the Lord has already revealed We should not assume that we know We need to approach the subject with the humility of a child Every generation must learn anew the doctrines that undergird the Lord s way of caring for the needy As many prophets have instructed us over the years the welfare principles of the Church are not simply good ideas they are revealed truths from God they are His way of helping the needy Brethren study the revealed principles and doctrines first Read the handbooks regarding Church welfare 13 take advantage of the Internet website providentliving org reread the June 2011 Liahona and Ensign article on the Church welfare plan Find out about the Lord s way of providing for His Saints Learn how the principles of care for the needy service to neighbor and self reliance complement each other The Lord s way of self reliance involves in a balanced way many facets of life including education health employment family finances and spiritual strength Familiarize yourself with the modern welfare program of the Church 14Once you have studied the doctrines and principles of the Churchwide welfare plan seek to apply what you have learned to the needs of those within your stewardship What this means is that in large measure you re going to have to figure it out for yourself Every family every congregation every area of the world is different There is no one size fits all answer in Church welfare It is a self help program where individuals are responsible for personal self reliance Our resources include personal prayer our own God given talents and abilities the assets available to us through our own families and extended family members various community resources and of course the caring support of priesthood quorums and the Relief Society This will lead us through the inspired pattern of self reliance You re going to have to chart a course that is consistent with the Lord s doctrine and matches the circumstances of your geographic area To implement divine welfare principles you need not look always to Salt Lake City Instead you need to look into the handbooks into your heart and into heaven Trust the Lord s inspiration and follow His way In the end you must do in your area what disciples of Christ have done in every dispensation counsel together use all resources available seek the inspiration of the Holy Ghost ask the Lord for His confirmation and then roll up your sleeves and go to work I give you a promise if you will follow this pattern you will receive specific guidance as to the who what when and where of providing in the Lord s way The Blessings of Providing in the Lord s WayThe prophetic promises and blessings of Church welfare of providing in the Lord s way are some of the most magnificent and sublime the Lord has pronounced upon His children He said If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday and the Lord shall guide thee continually 15Whether we are rich or poor regardless of where we live on this globe we all need each other for it is in sacrificing our time talents and resources that our spirits mature and become refined This work of providing in the Lord s way is not simply another item in the catalog of programs of the Church It cannot be neglected or set aside It is central to our doctrine it is the essence of our religion Brethren it is our great and special privilege as priesthood holders to put the priesthood to work We must not turn aside our hearts or our heads from becoming more self reliant caring better for the needy and rendering compassionate service The temporal is intertwined with the spiritual God has given us this mortal experience and the temporal challenges that attend it as a laboratory where we can grow into the beings Heavenly Father wants us to become May we understand the great duty and blessing that come from following and providing in the Lord s way is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen

There once was a man whose lifelong dream was to board a cruise ship and sail the Mediterranean Sea He dreamed of walking the streets of Rome Athens and Istanbul He saved every penny until he had enough for his passage Since money was tight he brought an extra suitcase filled with cans of beans boxes of crackers and bags of powdered lemonade and that is what he lived on every day He would have loved to take part in the many activities offered on the ship working out in the gym playing miniature golf and swimming in the pool He envied those who went to movies shows and cultural presentations And oh how he yearned for only a taste of the amazing food he saw on the ship every meal appeared to be a feast But the man wanted to spend so very little money that he didn t participate in any of these He was able to see the cities he had longed to visit but for the most part of the journey he stayed in his cabin and ate only his humble food On the last day of the cruise a crew member asked him which of the farewell parties he would be attending It was then that the man learned that not only the farewell party but almost everything on board the cruise ship the food the entertainment all the activities had been included in the price of his ticket Too late the man realized that he had been living far beneath his privileges The question this parable raises is Are we as priesthood holders living below our privileges when it comes to the sacred power gifts and blessings that are our opportunity and right as bearers of God s priesthood The Glory and Grandeur of the PriesthoodWe all know that the priesthood is much more than just a name or title The Prophet Joseph taught that the Priesthood is an everlasting principle and existed with God from eternity to eternity without beginning of days or end of years 1 It holds even the key of the knowledge of God 2 In fact through the priesthood the very power of godliness is manifest 3The blessings of the priesthood transcend our ability to comprehend Faithful Melchizedek Priesthood holders can become the elect of God 4 They are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies 5 and can ultimately receive all that the Father hath 6 This may be hard to comprehend but it is beautiful and I testify that it is true The fact that our Heavenly Father would entrust this power and responsibility to man is evidence of His great love for us and a foreshadowing of our potential as sons of God in the hereafter Nevertheless too often our actions suggest that we live far beneath this potential When asked about the priesthood many of us can recite a correct definition but in our daily lives there may be little evidence that our understanding goes beyond the level of a rehearsed script Brethren we are faced with a choice We can be satisfied with a diminished experience as priesthood bearers and settle for experiences far below our privileges Or we can partake of an abundant feast of spiritual opportunity and universal priesthood blessings What Can We Do to Live Up to Our Potential The words written in the scriptures and spoken in general conference are for us to liken them unto ourselves 7 not for reading or hearing only 8 Too often we attend meetings and nod our heads we might even smile knowingly and agree We jot down some action points and we may say to ourselves That is something I will do But somewhere between the hearing the writing of a reminder on our smartphone and the actual doing our do it switch gets rotated to the later position Brethren let s make sure to set our do it switch always to the now position As you read the scriptures and listen to the words of the prophets with all your heart and mind the Lord will tell you how to live up to your priesthood privileges Don t let a day go by without doing something to act on the promptings of the Spirit First Read the Owner s ManualIf you owned the world s most advanced and expensive computer would you use it merely as a desk ornament The computer may look impressive It may have all kinds of potential But it is only when you study the owner s manual learn how to use the software and turn on the power that you can access its full potential The holy priesthood of God also has an owner s manual Let us commit to reading the scriptures and handbooks with more purpose and more focus Let us begin by rereading sections 20 84 107 and 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants The more we study the purpose potential and practical use of the priesthood the more we will be amazed by its power and the Spirit will teach us how to access and use that power to bless our families our communities and the Church As a people we rightfully place high priority on secular learning and vocational development We want and we must excel in scholarship and craftsmanship I commend you for striving diligently to gain an education and become an expert in your field I invite you to also become experts in the doctrines of the gospel especially the doctrine of the priesthood We live in a time when the scriptures and the words of modern day prophets are more easily accessible than at any time in the history of the world However it is our privilege and duty and it is our responsibility to reach out and grasp their teachings The principles and doctrines of the priesthood are sublime and supernal The more we study the doctrine and potential and apply the practical purpose of the priesthood the more our souls will be expanded and our understanding enlarged and we will see what the Lord has in store for us Second Seek the Revelations of the SpiritA sure testimony of Jesus Christ and of His restored gospel takes more than knowledge it requires personal revelation confirmed through honest and dedicated application of gospel principles The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that the priesthood is a channel through which the Almighty commenced revealing His glory at the beginning of the creation of this earth and through which He has continued to reveal Himself to the children of men to the present time 9If we are not seeking to use this channel of revelation we are living beneath our priesthood privileges For example there are those who believe but don t know that they believe They have received various answers by the still small voice over an extended period of time but because this inspiration seems so small and insignificant they do not recognize it for what it really is As a result they allow doubts to keep them from fulfilling their potential as priesthood holders Revelation and testimony do not always come with overwhelming force For many a testimony comes slowly a piece at a time Sometimes it comes so gradually that it is hard to recall the exact moment we actually knew the gospel was true The Lord gives us line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little 10In some ways our testimony is like a snowball that grows larger with every turn We start out with a small amount of light even if it is only a desire to believe Gradually light cleaveth unto light 11 and he that receiveth light and continueth in God receiveth more light and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day 12 when in due time we receive of his fulness 13Think of what a glorious thing it is to reach beyond our earthly limitations to have the eyes of our understanding opened and receive light and knowledge from celestial sources It is our privilege and opportunity as bearers of the priesthood to seek personal revelation and to learn how to know the truth for ourselves through the sure witness of the Holy Spirit Let us earnestly seek the light of personal inspiration Let us plead with the Lord to endow our mind and soul with the spark of faith that will enable us to receive and recognize the divine ministering of the Holy Spirit for our specific life situations and for our challenges and priesthood duties Third Find Joy in Priesthood ServiceDuring my career as an airline pilot I had the opportunity to be a check and training captain Part of this job was to train and test experienced pilots to ensure that they had the necessary knowledge and skills to safely and efficiently operate those magnificent big jets I found that there were pilots who even after many years of flying professionally never lost the thrill of climbing into the atmosphere having slipped the surly bonds of Earth and danced the skies on laughter silvered wings 14 They loved the sound of rushing air the growling of the powerful engines the feeling of being one with the wind and one with the dark sky and the stars ahead 15 Their enthusiasm was contagious There were also a few who seemed to be merely going through the motions They had mastered the systems and the handling of the jets but somewhere along the way they had lost the joy of flying where never lark or even eagle flew 16 They had lost their sense of awe at a glowing sunrise at the beauties of God s creations as they crossed oceans and continents If they met the official requirements I certified them but at the same time I felt sorry for them You may want to ask yourself if you are merely going through the motions as a priesthood bearer doing what is expected but not experiencing the joy that should be yours Holding the priesthood gives us abundant opportunities to feel the joy that Ammon expressed Have we not great reason to rejoice We have been instruments in the Lord s hands of doing this great and marvelous work Therefore let us glory in the Lord yea we will rejoice 17Brethren our religion is a joyful one We are most blessed to bear the priesthood of God In the book of Psalms we read Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk O Lord in the light of thy countenance 18 We can experience this greater joy if we but look for it Too often we fail to experience the bliss that comes from daily practical priesthood service At times assignments can feel like burdens Brethren let us not pass through life immersed in the three Ws wearied worrying and whining We live beneath our privileges when we allow worldly anchors to keep us away from the abundant joy that comes from faithful and dedicated priesthood service especially within the walls of our own homes We live beneath our privileges when we fail to partake of the feast of happiness peace and joy that God grants so bountifully to faithful priesthood servants Young men if coming to church early to help prepare the sacrament feels more like a hardship than a blessing then I invite you to think about what this sacred ordinance might mean to a ward member who perhaps has had a challenging week Brethren if your home teaching efforts don t seem to be effective to you I invite you to see with the eye of faith what a visit from a servant of the Lord will do for a family that has many unseen problems When you grasp the divine potential of your priesthood service the Spirit of God will fill your hearts and minds it will shine in your eyes and faces As bearers of the priesthood let us never become hardened to the wonder and awe of what the Lord has entrusted to us ConclusionMy dear brethren may we diligently seek to learn the doctrine of the holy priesthood may we strengthen our testimonies line upon line by receiving the revelations of the Spirit and may we find true joy in daily priesthood service As we do these things we will begin to live up to our potential and privileges as priesthood holders and we will be able to do all things through Christ which strengtheneth us 19 Of this I bear testimony as an Apostle of the Lord and leave you my blessing in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
One of the most remarkable events in the history of the world happened on the road to Damascus You know well the story of Saul a young man who had made havock of the church entering into every house committing the Saints to prison 1 Saul was so hostile that many members of the early Church fled Jerusalem in the hope of escaping his anger Saul pursued them But as he came near Damascus suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me 2This transformative moment changed Saul forever Indeed it changed the world We know that manifestations such as this happen In fact we testify that a similar divine experience happened in 1820 to a boy named Joseph Smith It is our clear and certain testimony that the heavens are open again and that God speaks to His prophets and apostles God hears and answers the prayers of His children Nevertheless there are some who feel that unless they have an experience similar to Saul s or Joseph Smith s they cannot believe They stand at the waters of baptism but do not enter They wait at the threshold of testimony but cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the truth Instead of taking small steps of faith on the path of discipleship they want some dramatic event to compel them to believe They spend their days waiting on the road to Damascus Belief Comes One Step at a TimeOne dear sister had been a faithful member of the Church all her life But she carried a personal sorrow Years before her daughter had died after a short illness and the wounds from this tragedy still haunted her She agonized over the profound questions that accompany an event such as this She frankly admitted that her testimony wasn t what it used to be She felt that unless the heavens parted for her she would never be able to believe again So she found herself waiting There are many others who for different reasons find themselves waiting on the road to Damascus They delay becoming fully engaged as disciples They hope to receive the priesthood but hesitate to live worthy of that privilege They desire to enter the temple but delay the final act of faith to qualify They remain waiting for the Christ to be given to them like a magnificent Carl Bloch painting to remove once and for all their doubts and fears The truth is those who diligently seek to learn of Christ eventually will come to know Him They will personally receive a divine portrait of the Master although it most often comes in the form of a puzzle one piece at a time Each individual piece may not be easily recognizable by itself it may not be clear how it relates to the whole Each piece helps us to see the big picture a little more clearly Eventually after enough pieces have been put together we recognize the grand beauty of it all Then looking back on our experience we see that the Savior had indeed come to be with us not all at once but quietly gently almost unnoticed This can be our experience if we move forward with faith and do not wait too long on the road to Damascus Hearken and HeedI testify to you that our Father in Heaven loves His children He loves us He loves you When necessary the Lord will even carry you over obstacles as you seek His peace with a broken heart and a contrite spirit Often He speaks to us in ways that we can hear only with our heart To better hear His voice it would be wise to turn down the volume control of the worldly noise in our lives If we ignore or block out the promptings of the Spirit for whatever reason they become less noticeable until we cannot hear them at all Let us learn to hearken to the promptings of the Spirit and then be eager to heed them Our beloved prophet Thomas S Monson is our example in this regard The stories of his attention to the whisperings of the Spirit are numerous Elder Jeffrey R Holland relates one such example Once while President Monson was on assignment in Louisiana a stake president asked him if he would have time to visit a 10 year old girl named Christal who was in the final stages of cancer Christal s family had been praying that President Monson would come But their home was far away and the schedule was so tight that there wasn t time So instead President Monson asked that those who offered prayers during the stake conference include Christal in their prayers Surely the Lord and the family would understand During the Saturday session of the conference as President Monson stood to speak the Spirit whispered Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God 3 His notes became a blur He attempted to pursue the theme of the meeting as outlined but the name and image of the little girl would not leave his mind 4He listened to the Spirit and rearranged his schedule Early the next morning President Monson left the ninety and nine and traveled many miles to be at the bedside of the one Once there he gazed down upon a child too ill to rise too weak to speak Her illness had now rendered her sightless Deeply touched by the scene and the Spirit of the Lord Brother Monson took the child s frail hand in his own Christal he whispered I am here With great effort she whispered back Brother Monson I just knew you would come 5My dear brothers and sisters let us strive to be among those whom the Lord can rely on to hear His whisperings and respond as Saul did on his road to Damascus Lord what wilt thou have me to do 6ServeAnother reason we sometimes do not recognize the voice of the Lord in our lives is because the revelations of the Spirit may not come directly to us as the answer to our prayers Our Father in Heaven expects us to study it out first and then pray for guidance as we seek answers to questions and concerns in our personal lives We have our Heavenly Father s assurance that He will hear and answer our prayers The answer may come through the voice and wisdom of trusted friends and family the scriptures and the words of prophets It has been my experience that some of the most powerful promptings we receive are not only for our own benefit but also for the benefit of others If we are thinking only of ourselves we may miss some of the most powerful spiritual experiences and profound revelations of our lives President Spencer W Kimball taught this concept when he said God does notice us and he watches over us But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs Therefore it is vital that we serve each other 7 Brothers and sisters we each have a covenant responsibility to be sensitive to the needs of others and serve as the Savior did to reach out bless and uplift those around us Often the answer to our prayer does not come while we re on our knees but while we re on our feet serving the Lord and serving those around us Selfless acts of service and consecration refine our spirits remove the scales from our spiritual eyes and open the windows of heaven By becoming the answer to someone s prayer we often find the answer to our own ShareThere are times when the Lord reveals to us things that are intended only for us Nevertheless in many many cases He entrusts a testimony of the truth to those who will share it with others This has been the case with every prophet since the days of Adam Even more the Lord expects the members of His Church to open their mouths at all times declaring His gospel with the sound of rejoicing 8This is not always easy Some would rather pull a handcart across the prairie than bring up the subject of faith and religion to their friends and co workers They worry about how they might be perceived or how it might harm their relationship It doesn t need to be that way because we have a glad message to share and we have a message of joy Years ago our family lived and worked among people who in almost every case were not of our faith When they asked us how our weekend was we tried to skip the usual topics like sports events movies or the weather and tried to share some religious experiences we had as a family over the weekend for instance what a youth speaker had said about the standards from For the Strength of Youth or how we were touched by the words of a young man who was leaving on his mission or how the gospel and the Church helped us as a family to overcome a specific challenge we had We tried not to be preachy or overbearing My wife Harriet was always the best at finding something inspirational uplifting or humorous to share This often would lead to more in depth discussions Interestingly enough whenever we talked with friends about coping with life s challenges we often heard the comment It s easy for you you have your church With so many social media resources and a multitude of more or less useful gadgets at our disposal sharing the good news of the gospel is easier and the effects more far reaching than ever before In fact I am almost afraid that some listening have already sent text messages like He s been speaking for 10 minutes and still no aviation analogy My dear young friends perhaps the Lord s encouragement to open your mouths 9 might today include use your hands to blog and text message the gospel to all the world But please remember all at the right time and at the right place Brothers and sisters with the blessings of modern technology we can express gratitude and joy about God s great plan for His children in a way that can be heard not only around our workplace but around the world Sometimes a single phrase of testimony can set events in motion that affect someone s life for eternity The most effective way to preach the gospel is through example If we live according to our beliefs people will notice If the countenance of Jesus Christ shines in our lives 10 if we are joyful and at peace with the world people will want to know why One of the greatest sermons ever pronounced on missionary work is this simple thought attributed to Saint Francis of Assisi Preach the gospel at all times and if necessary use words 11 Opportunities to do so are all around us Do not miss them by waiting too long on the road to Damascus Our Road to DamascusI testify that the Lord speaks to His prophets and apostles in our day He also speaks to all who come to Him with a sincere heart and real intent 12Do not doubt Remember Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed 13 God loves you He hears your prayers He speaks to His children and offers comfort peace and understanding to those who seek Him and honor Him by walking in His way I bear my sacred witness that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is on course We have a living prophet This Church is led by Him whose name we bear even the Savior Jesus Christ Brothers and sisters dear friends let us not wait too long on our road to Damascus Instead let us courageously move forward in faith hope and charity and we will be blessed with the light we are all seeking upon the path of true discipleship For this I pray and leave you my blessing in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers thank you for assembling all around the world for this priesthood session of general conference Your presence shows your commitment to stand wherever you are with your brothers who bear the holy priesthood and serve and honor your Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ Often we mark the span of our lives by events that leave imprints on our minds and hearts There are many such events in my life one of which happened in 1989 when I heard a timeless sermon by President Ezra Taft Benson Beware of Pride In the introduction it was noted that this topic had been weighing heavily on President Benson s soul for some time 1I have felt a similar burden during the past months The promptings of the Holy Spirit have urged me to add my voice as another witness to President Benson s message delivered 21 years ago Every mortal has at least a casual if not intimate relationship with the sin of pride No one has avoided it few overcome it When I told my wife that this would be the topic of my talk she smiled and said It is so good that you talk about things you know so much about Other Meanings of PrideI also remember one interesting side effect of President Benson s influential talk For a while it almost became taboo among Church members to say that they were proud of their children or their country or that they took pride in their work The very word pride seemed to become an outcast in our vocabulary In the scriptures we find plenty of examples of good and righteous people who rejoice in righteousness and at the same time glory in the goodness of God Our Heavenly Father Himself introduced His Beloved Son with the words in whom I am well pleased 2Alma gloried in the thought that he might be an instrument in the hands of God 3 The Apostle Paul gloried in the faithfulness of members of the Church 4 The great missionary Ammon gloried in the success he and his brothers had experienced as missionaries 5I believe there is a difference between being proud of certain things and being prideful I am proud of many things I am proud of my wife I am proud of our children and grandchildren I am proud of the youth of the Church and I rejoice in their goodness I am proud of you my dear and faithful brethren I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with you as a bearer of the holy priesthood of God Pride Is the Sin of Self ElevationSo what is the difference between this kind of feeling and the pride that President Benson called the universal sin 6 Pride is sinful as President Benson so memorably taught because it breeds hatred or hostility and places us in opposition to God and our fellowmen At its core pride is a sin of comparison for though it usually begins with Look how wonderful I am and what great things I have done it always seems to end with Therefore I am better than you When our hearts are filled with pride we commit a grave sin for we violate the two great commandments 7 Instead of worshipping God and loving our neighbor we reveal the real object of our worship and love the image we see in the mirror Pride is the great sin of self elevation It is for so many a personal Rameumptom a holy stand that justifies envy greed and vanity 8 In a sense pride is the original sin for before the foundations of this earth pride felled Lucifer a son of the morning who was in authority in the presence of God 9 If pride can corrupt one as capable and promising as this should we not examine our own souls as well Pride Has Many FacesPride is a deadly cancer It is a gateway sin that leads to a host of other human weaknesses In fact it could be said that every other sin is in essence a manifestation of pride This sin has many faces It leads some to revel in their own perceived self worth accomplishments talents wealth or position They count these blessings as evidence of being chosen superior or more righteous than others This is the sin of Thank God I am more special than you At its core is the desire to be admired or envied It is the sin of self glorification For others pride turns to envy they look bitterly at those who have better positions more talents or greater possessions than they do They seek to hurt diminish and tear down others in a misguided and unworthy attempt at self elevation When those they envy stumble or suffer they secretly cheer The Laboratory of SportsPerhaps there is no better laboratory to observe the sin of pride than the world of sports I have always loved participating in and attending sporting events But I confess there are times when the lack of civility in sports is embarrassing How is it that normally kind and compassionate human beings can be so intolerant and filled with hatred toward an opposing team and its fans I have watched sports fans vilify and demonize their rivals They look for any flaw and magnify it They justify their hatred with broad generalizations and apply them to everyone associated with the other team When ill fortune afflicts their rival they rejoice Brethren unfortunately we see today too often the same kind of attitude and behavior spill over into the public discourse of politics ethnicity and religion My dear brethren of the priesthood my beloved fellow disciples of the gentle Christ should we not hold ourselves to a higher standard As priesthood bearers we must realize that all of God s children wear the same jersey Our team is the brotherhood of man This mortal life is our playing field Our goal is to learn to love God and to extend that same love toward our fellowman We are here to live according to His law and establish the kingdom of God We are here to build uplift treat fairly and encourage all of Heavenly Father s children We Must Not InhaleWhen I was called as a General Authority I was blessed to be tutored by many of the senior Brethren in the Church One day I had the opportunity to drive President James E Faust to a stake conference During the hours we spent in the car President Faust took the time to teach me some important principles about my assignment He explained also how gracious the members of the Church are especially to General Authorities He said They will treat you very kindly They will say nice things about you He laughed a little and then said Dieter be thankful for this But don t you ever inhale it That is a good lesson for us all brethren in any calling or life situation We can be grateful for our health wealth possessions or positions but when we begin to inhale it when we become obsessed with our status when we focus on our own importance power or reputation when we dwell upon our public image and believe our own press clippings that s when the trouble begins that s when pride begins to corrupt There are plenty of warnings about pride in the scriptures Only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom 10The Apostle Peter warned that God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble 11 Mormon explained None is acceptable before God save the meek and lowly in heart 12 And by design the Lord chooses the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty 13 The Lord does this to show that His hand is in His work lest we trust in the arm of flesh 14We are servants of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ We are not given the priesthood so that we can take our bows and bask in praise We are here to roll up our sleeves and go to work We are enlisted in no ordinary task We are called to prepare the world for the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ We seek not our own honor but give praise and glory to God We know that the contribution we can make by ourselves is small nevertheless as we exercise the power of the priesthood in righteousness God can cause a great and marvelous work to come forth through our efforts We must learn as Moses did that man is nothing 15 by himself but that with God all things are possible 16Jesus Christ Is the Perfect Example of HumilityIn this as in all things Jesus Christ is our perfect example Whereas Lucifer tried to change the Father s plan of salvation and obtain honor for himself the Savior said Father thy will be done and the glory be thine forever 17 Despite His magnificent abilities and accomplishments the Savior was always meek and humble Brethren we hold the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God 18 It is the power God has granted to men on earth to act for Him In order to exercise His power we must strive to be like the Savior This means that in all things we seek to do the will of the Father just as the Savior did 19 It means that we give all glory to the Father just as the Savior did 20 It means that we lose ourselves in the service of others just as the Savior did Pride is a switch that turns off priesthood power 21 Humility is a switch that turns it on Be Humble and Full of LoveSo how do we conquer this sin of pride that is so prevalent and so damaging How do we become more humble It is almost impossible to be lifted up in pride when our hearts are filled with charity No one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love 22 When we see the world around us through the lens of the pure love of Christ we begin to understand humility Some suppose that humility is about beating ourselves up Humility does not mean convincing ourselves that we are worthless meaningless or of little value Nor does it mean denying or withholding the talents God has given us We don t discover humility by thinking less of ourselves we discover humility by thinking less about ourselves It comes as we go about our work with an attitude of serving God and our fellowman Humility directs our attention and love toward others and to Heavenly Father s purposes Pride does the opposite Pride draws its energy and strength from the deep wells of selfishness The moment we stop obsessing with ourselves and lose ourselves in service our pride diminishes and begins to die My dear brethren there are so many people in need whom we could be thinking about instead of ourselves And please don t ever forget your own family your own wife There are so many ways we could be serving We have no time to become absorbed in ourselves I once owned a pen that I loved to use during my career as an airline captain By simply turning the shaft I could choose one of four colors The pen did not complain when I wanted to use red ink instead of blue It did not say to me I would rather not write after 10 00 p m in heavy fog or at high altitudes The pen did not say Use me only for important documents not for the daily mundane tasks With greatest reliability it performed every task I needed no matter how important or insignificant It was always ready to serve In a similar way we are tools in the hands of God When our heart is in the right place we do not complain that our assigned task is unworthy of our abilities We gladly serve wherever we are asked When we do this the Lord can use us in ways beyond our understanding to accomplish His work Let me conclude with words from President Ezra Taft Benson s inspired message of 21 years ago Pride is the great stumbling block to Zion We must cleanse the inner vessel by conquering pride 23 We must yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit put off the prideful natural man become a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord and become as a child submissive meek humble 24 God will have a humble people Blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble 25 Let us choose to be humble We can do it I know we can 26My beloved brethren let us follow the example of our Savior and reach out to serve rather than seeking the praise and honor of men It is my prayer that we will recognize and root out unrighteous pride in our hearts and that we will replace it with righteousness godliness faith love patience and meekness 27 In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
It s remarkable how much we can learn about life by studying nature For example scientists can look at the rings of trees and make educated guesses about climate and growing conditions hundreds and even thousands of years ago One of the things we learn from studying the growth of trees is that during seasons when conditions are ideal trees grow at a normal rate However during seasons when growing conditions are not ideal trees slow down their growth and devote their energy to the basic elements necessary for survival At this point some of you may be thinking That s all very fine and good but what does it have to do with flying an airplane Well let me tell you Have you ever been in an airplane and experienced turbulence The most common cause of turbulence is a sudden change in air movement causing the aircraft to pitch yaw and roll While planes are built to withstand far greater turbulence than anything you would encounter on a regular flight it still may be disconcerting to passengers What do you suppose pilots do when they encounter turbulence A student pilot may think that increasing speed is a good strategy because it will get them through the turbulence faster But that may be the wrong thing to do Professional pilots understand that there is an optimum turbulence penetration speed that will minimize the negative effects of turbulence And most of the time that would mean to reduce your speed The same principle applies also to speed bumps on a road Therefore it is good advice to slow down a little steady the course and focus on the essentials when experiencing adverse conditions The Pace of Modern LifeThis is a simple but critical lesson to learn It may seem logical when put in terms of trees or turbulence but it s surprising how easy it is to ignore this lesson when it comes to applying these principles in our own daily lives When stress levels rise when distress appears when tragedy strikes too often we attempt to keep up the same frantic pace or even accelerate thinking somehow that the more rushed our pace the better off we will be One of the characteristics of modern life seems to be that we are moving at an ever increasing rate regardless of turbulence or obstacles Let s be honest it s rather easy to be busy We all can think up a list of tasks that will overwhelm our schedules Some might even think that their self worth depends on the length of their to do list They flood the open spaces in their time with lists of meetings and minutia even during times of stress and fatigue Because they unnecessarily complicate their lives they often feel increased frustration diminished joy and too little sense of meaning in their lives It is said that any virtue when taken to an extreme can become a vice Overscheduling our days would certainly qualify for this There comes a point where milestones can become millstones and ambitions albatrosses around our necks What Is the Solution The wise understand and apply the lessons of tree rings and air turbulence They resist the temptation to get caught up in the frantic rush of everyday life They follow the advice There is more to life than increasing its speed 1 In short they focus on the things that matter most Elder Dallin H Oaks in a recent general conference taught We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families 2The search for the best things inevitably leads to the foundational principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ the simple and beautiful truths revealed to us by a caring eternal and all knowing Father in Heaven These core doctrines and principles though simple enough for a child to understand provide the answers to the most complex questions of life There is a beauty and clarity that comes from simplicity that we sometimes do not appreciate in our thirst for intricate solutions For example it wasn t long after astronauts and cosmonauts orbited the earth that they realized ballpoint pens would not work in space And so some very smart people went to work solving the problem It took thousands of hours and millions of dollars but in the end they developed a pen that could write anywhere in any temperature and on nearly any surface But how did the astronauts and cosmonauts get along until the problem was solved They simply used a pencil Leonardo da Vinci is quoted as saying that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication 3 When we look at the foundational principles of the plan of happiness the plan of salvation we can recognize and appreciate in its plainness and simplicity the elegance and beauty of our Heavenly Father s wisdom Then turning our ways to His ways is the beginning of our wisdom The Power of BasicsThe story is told that the legendary football coach Vince Lombardi had a ritual he performed on the first day of training He would hold up a football show it to the athletes who had been playing the sport for many years and say Gentlemen this is a football He talked about its size and shape how it can be kicked carried or passed He took the team out onto the empty field and said This is a football field He walked them around describing the dimensions the shape the rules and how the game is played 4This coach knew that even these experienced players and indeed the team could become great only by mastering the fundamentals They could spend their time practicing intricate trick plays but until they mastered the fundamentals of the game they would never become a championship team I think most of us intuitively understand how important the fundamentals are It is just that we sometimes get distracted by so many things that seem more enticing Printed material wide ranging media sources electronic tools and gadgets all helpful if used properly can become hurtful diversions or heartless chambers of isolation Yet amidst the multitude of voices and choices the humble Man of Galilee stands with hands outstretched waiting His is a simple message Come follow me 5 And He does not speak with a powerful megaphone but with a still small voice 6 It is so easy for the basic gospel message to get lost amidst the deluge of information that hits us from all sides The holy scriptures and the spoken word of the living prophets give emphasis to the fundamental principles and doctrines of the gospel The reason we return to these foundational principles to the pure doctrines is because they are the gateway to truths of profound meaning They are the door to experiences of sublime importance that would otherwise be beyond our capacity to comprehend These simple basic principles are the key to living in harmony with God and man They are the keys to opening the windows of heaven They lead us to the peace joy and understanding that Heavenly Father has promised to His children who hear and obey Him My dear brothers and sisters we would do well to slow down a little proceed at the optimum speed for our circumstances focus on the significant lift up our eyes and truly see the things that matter most Let us be mindful of the foundational precepts our Heavenly Father has given to His children that will establish the basis of a rich and fruitful mortal life with promises of eternal happiness They will teach us to do all these things in wisdom and order for it is not requisite that we should run faster than we have strength But it is expedient that we should be diligent and thereby win the prize 7Brothers and sisters diligently doing the things that matter most will lead us to the Savior of the world That is why we talk of Christ we rejoice in Christ we preach of Christ we prophesy of Christ that we may know to what source we may look for a remission of our sins 8 In the complexity confusion and rush of modern living this is the more excellent way 9So What Are the Basics As we turn to our Heavenly Father and seek His wisdom regarding the things that matter most we learn over and over again the importance of four key relationships with our God with our families with our fellowman and with ourselves As we evaluate our own lives with a willing mind we will see where we have drifted from the more excellent way The eyes of our understanding will be opened and we will recognize what needs to be done to purify our heart and refocus our life First our relationship with God is most sacred and vital We are His spirit children He is our Father He desires our happiness As we seek Him as we learn of His Son Jesus Christ as we open our hearts to the influence of the Holy Spirit our lives become more stable and secure We experience greater peace joy and fulfillment as we give our best to live according to God s eternal plan and keep His commandments We improve our relationship with our Heavenly Father by learning of Him by communing with Him by repenting of our sins and by actively following Jesus Christ for no man cometh unto the Father but by Christ 10 To strengthen our relationship with God we need some meaningful time alone with Him Quietly focusing on daily personal prayer and scripture study always aiming to be worthy of a current temple recommend these will be some wise investments of our time and efforts to draw closer to our Heavenly Father Let us heed the invitation in Psalms Be still and know that I am God 11Our second key relationship is with our families Since no other success can compensate for failure 12 here we must place high priority on our families We build deep and loving family relationships by doing simple things together like family dinner and family home evening and by just having fun together In family relationships love is really spelled t i m e time Taking time for each other is the key for harmony at home We talk with rather than about each other We learn from each other and we appreciate our differences as well as our commonalities We establish a divine bond with each other as we approach God together through family prayer gospel study and Sunday worship The third key relationship we have is with our fellowman We build this relationship one person at a time by being sensitive to the needs of others serving them and giving of our time and talents I was deeply impressed by one sister who was burdened with the challenges of age and illness but decided that although she couldn t do much she could listen And so each week she watched for people who looked troubled or discouraged and she spent time with them listening What a blessing she was in the lives of so many people The fourth key relationship is with ourselves It may seem odd to think of having a relationship with ourselves but we do Some people can t get along with themselves They criticize and belittle themselves all day long until they begin to hate themselves May I suggest that you reduce the rush and take a little extra time to get to know yourself better Walk in nature watch a sunrise enjoy God s creations ponder the truths of the restored gospel and find out what they mean for you personally Learn to see yourself as Heavenly Father sees you as His precious daughter or son with divine potential Rejoice in the Pure GospelBrothers and sisters let us be wise Let us turn to the pure doctrinal waters of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Let us joyfully partake of them in their simplicity and plainness The heavens are open again The gospel of Jesus Christ is on earth once more and its simple truths are a plentiful source of joy Brothers and sisters indeed we have great reason to rejoice If life and its rushed pace and many stresses have made it difficult for you to feel like rejoicing then perhaps now is a good time to refocus on what matters most Strength comes not from frantic activity but from being settled on a firm foundation of truth and light It comes from placing our attention and efforts on the basics of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ It comes from paying attention to the divine things that matter most Let us simplify our lives a little Let us make the changes necessary to refocus our lives on the sublime beauty of the simple humble path of Christian discipleship the path that leads always toward a life of meaning gladness and peace For this I pray as I leave you my blessing in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen

My dear young sisters all around the world I am grateful and honored to be with you today President Thomas S Monson and all the leaders of the Church love you we pray for you and we rejoice in your faithfulness Over the years I have been exposed to many beautiful languages each of them is fascinating and remarkable each has its particular charm But as different as these languages can be they often have things in common For example in most languages there exists a phrase as magical and full of promise as perhaps any in the world That phrase is Once upon a time Aren t those wonderful words to begin a story Once upon a time promises something a story of adventure and romance a story of princesses and princes It may include tales of courage hope and everlasting love In many of these stories nice overcomes mean and good overcomes evil But perhaps most of all I love it when we turn to the last page and our eyes reach the final lines and we see the enchanting words And they lived happily ever after Isn t that what we all desire to be the heroes and heroines of our own stories to triumph over adversity to experience life in all its beauty and in the end to live happily ever after Today I want to draw your attention to something very significant very extraordinary On the first page of your Young Women Personal Progress book you will find these words You are a beloved daughter of Heavenly Father prepared to come to the earth at this particular time for a sacred and glorious purpose 1Sisters those words are true They are not made up in a fairy tale Isn t it remarkable to know that our eternal Heavenly Father knows you hears you watches over you and loves you with an infinite love In fact His love for you is so great that He has granted you this earthly life as a precious gift of once upon a time complete with your own true story of adventure trial and opportunities for greatness nobility courage and love And most glorious of all He offers you a gift beyond price and comprehension Heavenly Father offers to you the greatest gift of all eternal life and the opportunity and infinite blessing of your own happily ever after But such a blessing does not come without a price It is not given simply because you desire it It comes only through understanding who you are and what you must become in order to be worthy of such a gift Trial Is Part of the JourneyFor a moment think back about your favorite fairy tale In that story the main character may be a princess or a peasant she might be a mermaid or a milkmaid a ruler or a servant You will find one thing all have in common they must overcome adversity Cinderella has to endure her wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters She is compelled to suffer long hours of servitude and ridicule In Beauty and the Beast Belle becomes a captive to a frightful looking beast in order to save her father She sacrifices her home and family all she holds dear to spend several months in the beast s castle In the tale Rumpelstiltskin a poor miller promises the king that his daughter can spin straw into gold The king immediately sends for her and locks her in a room with a mound of straw and a spinning wheel Later in the story she faces the danger of losing her firstborn child unless she can guess the name of the magical creature who helped her in this impossible task In each of these stories Cinderella Belle and the miller s daughter have to experience sadness and trial before they can reach their happily ever after Think about it Has there ever been a person who did not have to go through his or her own dark valley of temptation trial and sorrow Sandwiched between their once upon a time and happily ever after they all had to experience great adversity Why must all experience sadness and tragedy Why could we not simply live in bliss and peace each day filled with wonder joy and love The scriptures tell us there must be opposition in all things for without it we could not discern the sweet from the bitter 2 Would the marathon runner feel the triumph of finishing the race had she not felt the pain of the hours of pushing against her limits Would the pianist feel the joy of mastering an intricate sonata without the painstaking hours of practice In stories as in life adversity teaches us things we cannot learn otherwise Adversity helps to develop a depth of character that comes in no other way Our loving Heavenly Father has set us in a world filled with challenges and trials so that we through opposition can learn wisdom become stronger and experience joy Let me share with you a personal experience I had as a teenager while our family was attending church in Frankfurt Germany One Sunday the missionaries brought a new family to our meetings whom I hadn t seen before It was a mother with two beautiful daughters I thought that these missionaries were doing a very very good job I particularly took notice of the one daughter with gorgeous dark hair and large brown eyes Her name was Harriet and I think I fell in love with her from the first moment I saw her Unfortunately this beautiful young woman didn t seem to feel the same about me She had many young men who wanted to make her acquaintance and I began to wonder if she would ever see me as anything but a friend But I didn t let that deter me I figured out ways to be where she was When I passed the sacrament I made sure I was in the right position so that I would be the one to pass the sacrament to her When we had special activities at church I rode my bike to Harriet s house and rang the doorbell Harriet s mother usually answered In fact she opened the kitchen window of their apartment on the fourth floor and asked what I wanted I would ask if Harriet would like a ride to church on my bicycle Harriet s mother would say No she will be coming later but I will be happy to ride with you to church This wasn t exactly what I had in mind but how could I decline And so we rode to church I must admit I had a very impressive road bike Harriet s mother sat on the top tube bar just in front of me and I tried to be the most elegant bicycle driver over roads of rough cobblestone Time passed While beautiful Harriet was seeing many other young men it seemed that I could not make any headway with her Was I disappointed Yes Was I defeated Absolutely not Actually looking back I recognize that it doesn t hurt at all to be on good terms with the mother of the girl of your dreams Years later after I had finished my training as a fighter pilot in the air force I experienced a modern miracle in Harriet s response to my continued courting One day she said Dieter you have matured much over these past years I moved quickly after that and within a few months I was married to the woman I had loved ever since I first saw her The process hadn t been easy there were moments of suffering and despair but finally my happiness was full and it still is even more so My dear young sisters you need to know that you will experience your own adversity None is exempt You will suffer be tempted and make mistakes You will learn for yourself what every heroine has learned through overcoming challenges come growth and strength It is your reaction to adversity not the adversity itself that determines how your life s story will develop There are those among you who although young have already suffered a full measure of grief and sorrow My heart is filled with compassion and love for you How dear you are to the Church How beloved you are of your Heavenly Father Though it may seem that you are alone angels attend you Though you may feel that no one can understand the depth of your despair our Savior Jesus Christ understands He suffered more than we can possibly imagine and He did it for us He did it for you You are not alone If you ever feel your burden is too great to bear lift your heart to your Heavenly Father and He will uphold and bless you He says to you as He said to Joseph Smith Your adversity and your afflictions shall be but a small moment and then if you endure it well God shall exalt you on high 3Enduring adversity is not the only thing you must do to experience a happy life Let me repeat how you react to adversity and temptation is a critical factor in whether or not you arrive at your own happily ever after Stay True to What You Know Is RightSisters young sisters beloved young sisters stay true to what you know is right Everywhere you look today you will find promises of happiness Ads in magazines promise total bliss if you will only buy a certain outfit shampoo or makeup Certain media productions glamorize those who embrace evil or who give in to base instincts Often these same people are portrayed as models of success and accomplishment In a world where evil is portrayed as good and good as evil sometimes it is difficult to know the truth In some ways it is almost like Little Red Riding Hood s dilemma when you are not quite sure what you are seeing is it a beloved grandmother or is it a dangerous wolf I spent many years in the cockpit of an airplane My task was to get a big jet safely from any part of the world to our desired destination I knew with certainty that if I wanted to travel from New York to Rome I needed to fly east If some were to tell me that I should fly south I knew there was no truth in their words I would not trust them because I knew for myself No amount of persuasion no amount of flattery bribery or threats could convince me that flying south would get me to my destination because I knew We all search for happiness and we all try to find our own happily ever after The truth is God knows how to get there And He has created a map for you He knows the way He is your beloved Heavenly Father who seeks your good your happiness He desires with all the love of a perfect and pure Father that you reach your supernal destination The map is available to all It gives explicit directions of what to do and where to go to everyone who is striving to come unto Christ and stand as a witness of God at all times and in all things and in all places 4 All you have to do is trust your Heavenly Father Trust Him enough to follow His plan Nevertheless not all will follow the map They may look at it They may think it is reasonable perhaps even true But they do not follow the divine directions Many believe that any road will take them to a happily ever after Some may even become angry when others who know the way try to help and tell them They suppose that such advice is outdated irrelevant out of touch with modern life Sisters they suppose wrong The Gospel Is the Way to Happily Ever AfterI understand that at times some may wonder why they attend Church meetings or why it is so important to read the scriptures regularly or pray to our Heavenly Father daily Here is my answer You do these things because they are part of God s path for you And that path will take you to your happily ever after destination Happily ever after is not something found only in fairy tales You can have it It is available for you But you must follow your Heavenly Father s map Sisters please embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ Learn to love your Heavenly Father with all your heart might and mind Fill your souls with virtue and love goodness Always strive to bring out the best in yourself and others Learn to accept and act upon the Young Women values Live the standards in For the Strength of Youth These standards guide and direct you to your happily ever after Living these standards will prepare you to make sacred covenants in the temple and establish your own legacy of goodness in your individual circumstances Stand in holy places and be not moved 5 regardless of temptations or difficulties I promise you that future generations will be grateful for you and praise your name for your courage and faithfulness during this crucial time of your life My dear young sisters you who stand for truth and righteousness you who seek goodness you who have entered the waters of baptism and walk in the ways of the Lord our Father in Heaven has promised that you will mount up with wings as eagles you shall run and not be weary and you shall walk and not faint 6 You shall not be deceived 7 God will bless and prosper you 8 The gates of hell shall not prevail against you and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you and cause the heavens to shake for your good and his name s glory 9Sisters we love you We pray for you Be strong and of good courage You are truly royal spirit daughters of Almighty God You are princesses destined to become queens Your own wondrous story has already begun Your once upon a time is now As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I leave you my blessing and give you a promise that as you accept and live the values and principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ you will be prepared to strengthen home and family make and keep sacred covenants receive the ordinances of the temple and enjoy the blessings of exaltation 10 And the day will come when you turn the final pages of your own glorious story there you will read and experience the fulfillment of those blessed and wonderful words And they lived happily ever after Of this I testify in the holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
In the 1960s a professor at Stanford University began a modest experiment testing the willpower of four year old children He placed before them a large marshmallow and then told them they could eat it right away or if they waited for 15 minutes they could have two marshmallows He then left the children alone and watched what happened behind a two way mirror Some of the children ate the marshmallow immediately some could wait only a few minutes before giving in to temptation Only 30 percent were able to wait It was a mildly interesting experiment and the professor moved on to other areas of research for in his own words there are only so many things you can do with kids trying not to eat marshmallows But as time went on he kept track of the children and began to notice an interesting correlation the children who could not wait struggled later in life and had more behavioral problems while those who waited tended to be more positive and better motivated have higher grades and incomes and have healthier relationships What started as a simple experiment with children and marshmallows became a landmark study suggesting that the ability to wait to be patient was a key character trait that might predict later success in life 1Waiting Can Be HardWaiting can be hard Children know it and so do adults We live in a world offering fast food instant messaging on demand movies and immediate answers to the most trivial or profound questions We don t like to wait Some even feel their blood pressure rise when their line at the grocery store moves slower than those around them Patience the ability to put our desires on hold for a time is a precious and rare virtue We want what we want and we want it now Therefore the very idea of patience may seem unpleasant and at times bitter Nevertheless without patience we cannot please God we cannot become perfect Indeed patience is a purifying process that refines understanding deepens happiness focuses action and offers hope for peace As parents we know how unwise it would be to indulge our children s every desire But children are not the only ones who spoil when showered with immediate gratification Our Heavenly Father knows what good parents come to understand over time if children are ever going to mature and reach their potential they must learn to wait Patience Isn t Merely WaitingWhen I was 10 years old my family became refugees in a new land I had always been a good student in school that is until we arrived in West Germany There my educational experience was a significantly different one The geography we studied in my school was new to me The history we studied was also very different Before I had been learning Russian as a second language now it was English This was hard for me Indeed there were moments when I truly believed my tongue simply was not made to speak English Because so much of the curriculum was new and strange to me I fell behind For the first time in my life I began to wonder if I was simply not smart enough for school Fortunately I had a teacher who taught me to be patient He taught me that steady and consistent work patient persistence would help me to learn Over time difficult subjects became clearer even English Slowly I began to see that if I applied myself consistently I could learn It didn t come quickly but with patience it did come From that experience I learned that patience was far more than simply waiting for something to happen patience required actively working toward worthwhile goals and not getting discouraged when results didn t appear instantly or without effort There is an important concept here patience is not passive resignation nor is it failing to act because of our fears Patience means active waiting and enduring It means staying with something and doing all that we can working hoping and exercising faith bearing hardship with fortitude even when the desires of our hearts are delayed Patience is not simply enduring it is enduring well Impatience on the other hand is a symptom of selfishness It is a trait of the self absorbed It arises from the all too prevalent condition called center of the universe syndrome which leads people to believe that the world revolves around them and that all others are just supporting cast in the grand theater of mortality in which only they have the starring role How different this is my dear brethren from the standard the Lord has set for us as priesthood holders Patience a Principle of the PriesthoodAs priesthood bearers and representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ we must serve others in a manner consistent with His example There is a reason that almost every lesson on priesthood leadership at some point arrives at the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants In a few verses the Lord provides a master course in priesthood leadership No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by long suffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned 2The character traits and practices described in these verses are the foundation of godly patience and are inseparably connected to effective priesthood and patriarchal service These attributes will give you strength and wisdom in magnifying your callings in preaching the gospel in fellowshipping quorum members and in giving the most important priesthood service which is indeed the loving service within the walls of your own homes Let us always remember that one of the reasons God has entrusted the priesthood to us is to help prepare us for eternal blessings by refining our natures through the patience which priesthood service requires As the Lord is patient with us let us be patient with those we serve Understand that they like us are imperfect They like us make mistakes They like us want others to give them the benefit of the doubt Never give up on anyone And that includes not giving up on yourself I believe that every one of us at one time or another can identify with the servant in Christ s parable who owed money to the king and who pled with the king saying Lord have patience with me 3The Lord s Way and TimeThe children of Israel waited 40 years in the wilderness before they could enter the promised land Jacob waited 7 long years for Rachel The Jews waited 70 years in Babylon before they could return to rebuild the temple The Nephites waited for a sign of Christ s birth even knowing that if the sign did not come they would perish Joseph Smith s trials in Liberty Jail caused even the prophet of God to wonder How long 4In each case Heavenly Father had a purpose in requiring that His children wait Every one of us is called to wait in our own way We wait for answers to prayers We wait for things which at the time may appear so right and so good to us that we can t possibly imagine why Heavenly Father would delay the answer I remember when I was preparing to be trained as a fighter pilot We spent a great deal of our preliminary military training in physical exercise I m still not exactly sure why endless running was considered such an essential preparatory part of becoming a pilot Nevertheless we ran and we ran and we ran some more As I was running I began to notice something that frankly troubled me Time and again I was being passed by men who smoked drank and did all manner of things that were contrary to the gospel and in particular to the Word of Wisdom I remember thinking Wait a minute Aren t I supposed to be able to run and not be weary But I was weary and I was overtaken by people who were definitely not following the Word of Wisdom I confess it troubled me at the time I asked myself was the promise true or was it not The answer didn t come immediately But eventually I learned that God s promises are not always fulfilled as quickly as or in the way we might hope they come according to His timing and in His ways Years later I could see clear evidence of the temporal blessings that come to those who obey the Word of Wisdom in addition to the spiritual blessings that come immediately from obedience to any of God s laws Looking back I know for sure that the promises of the Lord if perhaps not always swift are always certain Patience Requires FaithBrigham Young taught that when something came up which he could not comprehend fully he would pray to the Lord Give me patience to wait until I can understand it for myself 5 And then Brigham would continue to pray until he could comprehend it We must learn that in the Lord s plan our understanding comes line upon line precept upon precept 6 In short knowledge and understanding come at the price of patience Often the deep valleys of our present will be understood only by looking back on them from the mountains of our future experience Often we can t see the Lord s hand in our lives until long after trials have passed Often the most difficult times of our lives are essential building blocks that form the foundation of our character and pave the way to future opportunity understanding and happiness Patience a Fruit of the SpiritPatience is a godly attribute that can heal souls unlock treasures of knowledge and understanding and transform ordinary men and women into saints and angels Patience is truly a fruit of the Spirit 7Patience means staying with something until the end It means delaying immediate gratification for future blessings It means reining in anger and holding back the unkind word It means resisting evil even when it appears to be making others rich Patience means accepting that which cannot be changed and facing it with courage grace and faith It means being willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon us even as a child doth submit to his father 8 Ultimately patience means being firm and steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord 9 every hour of every day even when it is hard to do so In the words of John the Revelator Here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and faith in Jesus 10Patience is a process of perfection The Savior Himself said that in your patience you possess your souls 11 Or to use another translation of the Greek text in your patience you win mastery of your souls 12 Patience means to abide in faith knowing that sometimes it is in the waiting rather than in the receiving that we grow the most This was true in the time of the Savior It is true in our time as well for we are commanded in these latter days to continue in patience until ye are perfected 13The Lord Blesses Us for Our PatienceTo paraphrase the Psalmist of old if we wait patiently for the Lord He will incline unto us He will hear our cries He will bring us out of a horrible pit and set our feet upon a solid rock He will put a new song in our mouths and we will praise our God Many around us will see it and they will trust in the Lord 14My dear brethren the work of patience boils down to this keep the commandments trust in God our Heavenly Father serve Him with meekness and Christlike love exercise faith and hope in the Savior and never give up The lessons we learn from patience will cultivate our character lift our lives and heighten our happiness They will help us to become worthy priesthood bearers and faithful disciples of our Master Jesus Christ It is my prayer that patience will be a defining characteristic of we who hold the priesthood of Almighty God that we will courageously trust the Lord s promises and His timing that we will act toward others with the patience and compassion we seek for ourselves and that we will continue in patience until we are perfected In the holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
A story is told that during the bombing of a city in World War II a large statue of Jesus Christ was severely damaged When the townspeople found the statue among the rubble they mourned because it had been a beloved symbol of their faith and of God s presence in their lives Experts were able to repair most of the statue but its hands had been damaged so severely that they could not be restored Some suggested that they hire a sculptor to make new hands but others wanted to leave it as it was a permanent reminder of the tragedy of war Ultimately the statue remained without hands However the people of the city added on the base of the statue of Jesus Christ a sign with these words You are my hands We Are the Hands of ChristThere is a profound lesson in this story When I think of the Savior I often picture Him with hands outstretched reaching out to comfort heal bless and love And He always talked with never down to people He loved the humble and the meek and walked among them ministering to them and offering hope and salvation That is what He did during His mortal life it is what He would be doing if He were living among us today and it is what we should be doing as His disciples and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints On this beautiful Easter morning our thoughts and hearts are drawn to Him the Hope of Israel and the Light of the World As we emulate His perfect example our hands can become His hands our eyes His eyes our heart His heart Our Hands Can EmbraceI am deeply impressed by the way our Church members extend themselves to others As we hear of your selfless sacrifice and overwhelming compassion our hearts swell with gratitude and happiness You are a shining light to the world and you are known for your goodness and compassion all around the globe Unfortunately from time to time we also hear of Church members who become discouraged and subsequently quit coming to and participating in our Church meetings because they think they don t fit in When I was a young boy during the aftermath of World War II Germany was broken and in ruins Many people were hungry sick and dying I remember well the humanitarian shipments of food and clothing that came from the Church in Salt Lake City To this day I can still remember the smell of the clothing and I can still taste the sweetness of the canned peaches There were some who joined the Church because of the goods they received at that time Some members looked down on these new converts They even called them an offensive name B chsen Mormonen or Canned Food Mormons They resented these new members because they believed that once their temporal needs had been met they would fall away While some did leave many stayed they came to church tasted the sweetness of the gospel and felt the tender embrace of caring brothers and sisters They discovered home And now three and four generations later many families trace their Church membership back to these converts I hope that we welcome and love all of God s children including those who might dress look speak or just do things differently It is not good to make others feel as though they are deficient Let us lift those around us Let us extend a welcoming hand Let us bestow upon our brothers and sisters in the Church a special measure of humanity compassion and charity so that they feel at long last they have finally found home When we are tempted to judge let us think of the Savior who loveth the world even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him And he saith Come unto me all ye ends of the earth for all men are privileged the one like unto the other and none are forbidden 1As I read the scriptures it appears that those who receive the Savior s strongest reproach are often those who hold themselves in high esteem because of their wealth influence or perceived righteousness On one occasion the Savior taught a parable of two men who went into the temple to pray One man a respected Pharisee prayed God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess The other man a hated publican stood afar off and would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner And Jesus said I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other 2In truth we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God 3 We are all in need of mercy In that last day when we are called to the judgment bar of God do we not hope that our many imperfections will be forgiven Do we not yearn to feel the Savior s embrace It seems only right and proper that we extend to others that which we so earnestly desire for ourselves I am not suggesting that we accept sin or overlook evil in our personal life or in the world Nevertheless in our zeal we sometimes confuse sin with sinner and we condemn too quickly and with too little compassion We know from modern revelation that the worth of souls is great in the sight of God 4 We cannot gauge the worth of another soul any more than we can measure the span of the universe Every person we meet is a VIP to our Heavenly Father Once we understand that we can begin to understand how we should treat our fellowmen One woman who had been through years of trial and sorrow said through her tears I have come to realize that I am like an old 20 dollar bill crumpled torn dirty abused and scarred But I am still a 20 dollar bill I am worth something Even though I may not look like much and even though I have been battered and used I am still worth the full 20 dollars Our Hands Can ComfortWith this in mind let our hearts and hands be stretched out in compassion toward others for everyone is walking his or her own difficult path As disciples of Jesus Christ our Master we are called to support and heal rather than condemn We are commanded to mourn with those that mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort 5It is unworthy of us as Christians to think that those who suffer deserve their suffering Easter Sunday is a good day to remember that our Savior willingly took upon Himself the pain and sickness and suffering of us all even those of us who appear to deserve our suffering 6In the book of Proverbs we read that a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity 7 Let us love at all times And let us especially be there for our brothers and sisters during times of adversity Our Hands Can ServeAn old Jewish legend tells of two brothers Abram and Zimri who owned a field and worked it together They agreed to divide both the labor and the harvest equally One night as the harvest came to a close Zimri could not sleep for it didn t seem right that Abram who had a wife and seven sons to feed should receive only half of the harvest while he with only himself to support had so much So Zimri dressed and quietly went into the field where he took a third of his harvest and put it in his brother s pile He then returned to his bed satisfied that he had done the right thing Meanwhile Abram could not sleep either He thought of his poor brother Zimri who was all alone and had no sons to help him with the work It did not seem right that Zimri who worked so hard by himself should get only half of the harvest Surely this was not pleasing to God And so Abram quietly went to the fields where he took a third of his harvest and placed it in the pile of his beloved brother The next morning the brothers went to the field and were both astonished that the piles still looked to be the same size That night both brothers slipped out of their houses to repeat their efforts of the previous night But this time they discovered each other and when they did they wept and embraced Neither could speak for their hearts were overcome with love and gratitude 8This is the spirit of compassion that we love others as ourselves 9 seek their happiness and do unto them as we hope they would do unto us 10True Love Requires ActionTrue love requires action We can speak of love all day long we can write notes or poems that proclaim it sing songs that praise it and preach sermons that encourage it but until we manifest that love in action our words are nothing but sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal 11Christ did not just speak about love He showed it each day of His life He did not remove Himself from the crowd Being amidst the people Jesus reached out to the one He rescued the lost He didn t just teach a class about reaching out in love and then delegate the actual work to others He not only taught but also showed us how to succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 12Christ knows how to minister to others perfectly When the Savior stretches out His hands those He touches are uplifted and become greater stronger and better people as a result If we are His hands should we not do the same We Can Love as He DoesThe Savior revealed the perfect priorities for our lives our homes our wards our communities and our nations when He spoke of love as the great commandment upon which hang all the law and the prophets 13 We can spend our days obsessing about the finest details of life the law and long lists of things to do but should we neglect the great commandments we are missing the point and we are clouds without water drifting in the winds and trees without fruit 14Without this love for God the Father and our fellowmen we are only the form of His Church without the substance What good is our teaching without love What good is missionary temple or welfare work without love Love is what inspired our Heavenly Father to create our spirits it is what led our Savior to the Garden of Gethsemane to make Himself a ransom for our sins Love is the grand motive of the plan of salvation it is the source of happiness the ever renewing spring of healing the precious fountain of hope As we extend our hands and hearts toward others in Christlike love something wonderful happens to us Our own spirits become healed more refined and stronger We become happier more peaceful and more receptive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit With all my heart and soul I give thanks to our Heavenly Father for His love for us for the gift of His Son for the life and example of Jesus the Christ and for His sinless and selfless sacrifice I rejoice in the fact that Christ is not dead but risen from the grave He lives and has returned to the earth to restore His authority and gospel to man He has given us the perfect example of the kind of men and women we should be On this Easter Sunday and every day as we contemplate with reverence and awe how our Savior embraces us comforts us and heals us let us commit to become His hands that others through us may feel His loving embrace In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is continually growing and becoming better known throughout the world Although there will always be those who stereotype the Church and its members in a negative way most people think of us as honest helpful and hardworking Some have images of clean cut missionaries loving families and friendly neighbors who don t smoke or drink We might also be known as a people who attend church every Sunday for three hours in a place where everyone is a brother or a sister where the children sing songs about streams that talk trees that produce popcorn and children who want to become sunbeams Brothers and sisters of all the things we want to be known for are there attributes above all others that should define us as members of His Church even as disciples of Jesus Christ Since our last general conference six months ago I have pondered this and similar questions Today I would like to share with you some thoughts and impressions that have come as a result of that inquiry The first question is How Do We Become True Disciples of Jesus Christ The Savior Himself provided the answer with this profound declaration If ye love me keep my commandments 1 This is the essence of what it means to be a true disciple those who receive Christ Jesus walk with Him 2But this may present a problem for some because there are so many shoulds and should nots that merely keeping track of them can be a challenge Sometimes well meaning amplifications of divine principles many coming from uninspired sources complicate matters further diluting the purity of divine truth with man made addenda One person s good idea something that may work for him or her takes root and becomes an expectation And gradually eternal principles can get lost within the labyrinth of good ideas This was one of the Savior s criticisms of the religious experts of His day whom He chastised for attending to the hundreds of minor details of the law while neglecting the weightier matters 3So how do we stay aligned with these weightier matters Is there a constant compass that can help us prioritize our lives thoughts and actions Once again the Savior revealed the way When asked to name the greatest commandment He did not hesitate Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind He said This is the first and great commandment 4 Coupled with the second great commandment to love our neighbor as ourselves5 we have a compass that provides direction not only for our lives but also for the Lord s Church on both sides of the veil Because love is the great commandment it ought to be at the center of all and everything we do in our own family in our Church callings and in our livelihood Love is the healing balm that repairs rifts in personal and family relationships It is the bond that unites families communities and nations Love is the power that initiates friendship tolerance civility and respect It is the source that overcomes divisiveness and hate Love is the fire that warms our lives with unparalleled joy and divine hope Love should be our walk and our talk When we truly understand what it means to love as Jesus Christ loves us the confusion clears and our priorities align Our walk as disciples of Christ becomes more joyful Our lives take on new meaning Our relationship with our Heavenly Father becomes more profound Obedience becomes a joy rather than a burden Why Should We Love God God the Eternal Father did not give that first great commandment because He needs us to love Him His power and glory are not diminished should we disregard deny or even defile His name His influence and dominion extend through time and space independent of our acceptance approval or admiration No God does not need us to love Him But oh how we need to love God For what we love determines what we seek What we seek determines what we think and do What we think and do determines who we are and who we will become We are created in the image of our heavenly parents we are God s spirit children Therefore we have a vast capacity for love it is part of our spiritual heritage What and how we love not only defines us as individuals it also defines us as a church Love is the defining characteristic of a disciple of Christ Since the beginning of time love has been the source of both the highest bliss and the heaviest burdens At the heart of misery from the days of Adam until today you will find the love of wrong things And at the heart of joy you will find the love of good things And the greatest of all good things is God Our Father in Heaven has given us His children much more than any mortal mind can comprehend Under His direction the Great Jehovah created this wondrous world we live in God the Father watches over us fills our hearts with breathtaking joy brightens our darkest hours with blessed peace distills upon our minds precious truths shepherds us through times of distress rejoices when we rejoice and answers our righteous petitions He offers to His children the promise of a glorious and infinite existence and has provided a way for us to progress in knowledge and glory until we receive a fulness of joy He has promised us all that He has If all that is not enough reason to love our Heavenly Father perhaps we can learn from the words of the Apostle John who said We love him because he first loved us 6Why Does Heavenly Father Love Us Think of the purest most all consuming love you can imagine Now multiply that love by an infinite amount that is the measure of God s love for you 7God does not look on the outward appearance 8 I believe that He doesn t care one bit if we live in a castle or a cottage if we are handsome or homely if we are famous or forgotten Though we are incomplete God loves us completely Though we are imperfect He loves us perfectly Though we may feel lost and without compass God s love encompasses us completely He loves us because He is filled with an infinite measure of holy pure and indescribable love We are important to God not because of our r sum but because we are His children He loves every one of us even those who are flawed rejected awkward sorrowful or broken God s love is so great that He loves even the proud the selfish the arrogant and the wicked What this means is that regardless of our current state there is hope for us No matter our distress no matter our sorrow no matter our mistakes our infinitely compassionate Heavenly Father desires that we draw near to Him so that He can draw near to us 9How Can We Increase Our Love of God Since God is love 10 the closer we approach Him the more profoundly we experience love 11 But because a veil separates this mortality from our heavenly home we must seek in the Spirit that which is imperceptible to mortal eyes Heaven may seem distant at times but the scriptures offer hope Ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart 12However seeking God with all our hearts implies much more than simply offering a prayer or pronouncing a few words inviting God into our lives For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments 13 We can make a great production of saying that we know God We can proclaim publicly that we love Him Nevertheless if we don t obey Him all is in vain for he that saith I know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him 14We increase our love for our Heavenly Father and demonstrate that love by aligning our thoughts and actions with God s word His pure love directs and encourages us to become more pure and holy It inspires us to walk in righteousness not out of fear or obligation but out of an earnest desire to become even more like Him because we love Him By doing so we can become born again and cleansed by blood even the blood of the Only Begotten that we might be sanctified from all sin and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world and eternal life in the world to come even immortal glory 15My dear brothers and sisters don t get discouraged if you stumble at times Don t feel downcast or despair if you don t feel worthy to be a disciple of Christ at all times The first step to walking in righteousness is simply to try We must try to believe Try to learn of God read the scriptures study the words of His latter day prophets choose to listen to the Father and do the things He asks of us Try and keep on trying until that which seems difficult becomes possible and that which seems only possible becomes habit and a real part of you How Can We Hear the Father s Voice As you reach out to your Heavenly Father as you pray to Him in the name of Christ He will answer you He speaks to us everywhere As you read God s word recorded in the scriptures listen for His voice During this general conference and later as you study the words spoken here listen for His voice As you visit the temple and attend Church meetings listen for His voice Listen for the voice of the Father in the bounties and beauties of nature in the gentle whisperings of the Spirit In your daily interactions with others in the words of a hymn in the laughter of a child listen for His voice If you listen for the voice of the Father He will lead you on a course that will allow you to experience the pure love of Christ As we draw near to Heavenly Father we become more holy And as we become more holy we will overcome disbelief and our souls will be filled with His blessed light As we align our lives with this supernal light it leads us out of darkness and toward greater light This greater light leads to the unspeakable ministerings of the Holy Spirit and the veil between heaven and earth can become thin Why Is Love the Great Commandment Heavenly Father s love for His children is the core message of the plan of happiness which plan is made active through the Atonement of Jesus Christ the greatest expression of love the world has ever known 16How clearly the Savior spoke when He said that every other commandment hangs upon the principle of love 17 If we do not neglect the great laws if we truly learn to love our Heavenly Father and our fellowman with all our heart soul and mind all else will fall into place The divine love of God turns ordinary acts into extraordinary service Divine love is the motive that transports simple words into sacred scripture Divine love is the factor that transforms reluctant compliance with God s commandments into blessed dedication and consecration Love is the guiding light that illuminates the disciple s path and fills our daily walk with life meaning and wonder Love is the measure of our faith the inspiration for our obedience and the true altitude of our discipleship Love is the way of the disciple I testify that God is in His heaven He lives He knows and loves you He is mindful of you He hears your prayers and knows the desires of your heart He is filled with infinite love for you Let me conclude as I began my dear brothers and sisters what attribute should define us as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Let us be known as a people who love God with all our heart soul and mind and who love our neighbor as ourselves When we understand and practice these two great commandments in our families in our wards and branches in our nations and in our daily lives we will begin to understand what it means to be a true disciple of Jesus the Christ Of this I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen

Today is the day the Christian world traditionally calls Palm Sunday You will remember that it was on that Sunday nearly 2 000 years ago that Jesus Christ entered the city of Jerusalem during the final week of His mortal life 1 In fulfillment of Zechariah s ancient prophecy 2 He rode in on a donkey and as He did so a great multitude came out to greet the Master and carpeted the path before Him with palm leaves flowering branches and even their own garments As He approached they cried Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord 3 and Hosanna to the Son of David 4Perhaps the disciples thought this was a turning point the moment when the Jewish world would finally recognize Jesus as the long awaited Messiah But the Savior understood that many of the shouts of praise and acclamation would be temporary He knew that soon He would ascend to the Mount of Olives and there alone in Gethsemane take upon Himself the sins of the world The Gospel of Jesus ChristIt is fitting that during the week from Palm Sunday to Easter morning we turn our thoughts to Jesus Christ the source of light life and love The multitudes in Jerusalem may have seen Him as a great king who would give them freedom from political oppression But in reality He gave much more than that He gave us His gospel a pearl beyond price the grand key of knowledge that once understood and applied unlocks a life of happiness peace and fulfillment The gospel is the good news of Christ It is the revelation that the Son of God came to earth lived a perfect life atoned for our sins and conquered death It is the path of salvation the way of hope and joy and the assurance that God has a plan of redemption and happiness for His children The gospel is the way of discipleship As we walk in that way we can experience confidence and joy even during times of peril sorrow and uncertainty The Way of the WorldWe live in a time when many worry about their livelihood They are concerned about the future and doubt their ability to resolve the challenges that confront them Many have experienced personal misfortune and sadness They hunger for meaning and purpose in life Because there is such great interest in these issues the world is not bashful in offering numerous new answers to every problem we face People run from one new idea to the next hoping to find something that will answer the burning questions of their souls They attend seminars and buy books CDs and other products They get caught up in the excitement of looking for something new But inevitably the flame of each new theory fades only to be replaced by another new and improved solution that promises to do what the others before could not It s not that these worldly options don t contain elements of truth many of them do Nevertheless they all fall short of the lasting change we seek in our lives After the excitement wears off the hollowness remains as we look for the next new idea to unlock the secrets of happiness In contrast the gospel of Jesus Christ has the answers to all of our problems The gospel is not a secret It is not complicated or hidden It can unlock the door to true happiness It is not someone s theory or proposition It does not come from man at all It springs from the pure and everlasting waters of the Creator of the universe who knows truths we cannot even begin to comprehend And with that knowledge He has given us the gospel a divine gift the ultimate formula for happiness and success How Do We Become Disciples of Jesus Christ When we hear the transcendent truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ hope and faith begin to blossom inside of us 5 The more we fill our hearts and minds with the message of the risen Christ the greater our desire is to follow Him and live His teachings This in turn causes our faith to grow and allows the light of Christ to illuminate our hearts As it does we recognize the imperfections in our lives and we desire to be cleansed of the depressing burdens of sin We yearn for freedom from guilt and this inspires us to repent Faith and repentance lead to the purifying waters of baptism where we covenant to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and walk in His footsteps To uphold us in the desire to lead a purified and holy life we are endowed with the baptism of fire the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost a heavenly Comforter who accompanies and guides us as we walk in the path of righteousness The more we are filled with the Spirit of God the more we extend ourselves to others We become peacemakers in our homes and families we help our fellowmen everywhere and we reach out in merciful acts of kindness forgiveness grace and long suffering patience These are the first steps along the true way of life and fulfillment This is the peaceable way of the follower of Jesus Christ The Path of PatienceNevertheless it is not a quick fix or an overnight cure A friend of mine recently wrote to me confiding that he was having a difficult time keeping his testimony strong and vibrant He asked for counsel I wrote back to him and lovingly suggested a few specific things he could do that would align his life more closely with the teachings of the restored gospel To my surprise I heard back from him only a week later The essence of his letter was this I tried what you suggested It didn t work What else have you got Brothers and sisters we have to stay with it We don t acquire eternal life in a sprint this is a race of endurance We have to apply and reapply the divine gospel principles Day after day we need to make them part of our normal life Too often we approach the gospel like a farmer who places a seed in the ground in the morning and expects corn on the cob by the afternoon When Alma compared the word of God to a seed he explained that the seed grows into a fruit bearing tree gradually as a result of our faith and our diligence and patience and long suffering 6 It s true that some blessings come right away soon after we plant the seed in our hearts it begins to swell and sprout and grow and by this we know that the seed is good From the very moment we set foot upon the pathway of discipleship seen and unseen blessings from God begin to attend us But we cannot receive the fulness of those blessings if we neglect the tree and take no thought for its nourishment 7Knowing that the seed is good is not enough We must nourish it with great care that it may get root 8 Only then can we partake of the fruit that is sweet above all that is sweet and pure above all that is pure and feast upon this fruit even until we are filled that we hunger not neither shall we thirst 9Discipleship is a journey We need the refining lessons of the journey to craft our character and purify our hearts By patiently walking in the path of discipleship we demonstrate to ourselves the measure of our faith and our willingness to accept God s will rather than ours It is not enough merely to speak of Jesus Christ or proclaim that we are His disciples It is not enough to surround ourselves with symbols of our religion Discipleship is not a spectator sport We cannot expect to experience the blessings of faith by standing inactive on the sidelines any more than we can experience the benefits of health by sitting on a sofa watching sporting events on television and giving advice to the athletes And yet for some spectator discipleship is a preferred if not a primary way of worshipping Ours is not a secondhand religion We cannot receive the blessings of the gospel merely by observing the good that others do We need to get off the sidelines and practice what we preach The Way Is Open to AllThe first step on the path of discipleship begins luckily enough in the exact place where we stand We do not have to prequalify to take that first step It doesn t matter if we are rich or poor There is no requirement to be educated eloquent or intellectual We do not have to be perfect or well spoken or even well mannered You and I can walk in the path of discipleship today Let us be humble let us pray to our Father in Heaven with all our heart and express our desire to draw close to Him and learn of Him Have faith Seek and you will find Knock and the door will be opened 10 Serve the Lord by serving others Become an active participant in your ward or branch Strengthen your family by committing to live the principles of the gospel Be of one heart and of one mind in your marriage and in your family Now is the time to adjust your lives to be able to have a temple recommend and use it Now is the time to have meaningful family home evenings to read the word of God and to speak to our Heavenly Father in earnest prayer Now is the time to fill our hearts with gratitude for the Restoration of His Church for living prophets the Book of Mormon and the priesthood power that blesses our lives Now is the time to embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ become His disciples and walk in His way There are some who believe that because they have made mistakes they can no longer fully partake of the blessings of the gospel How little they understand the purposes of the Lord One of the great blessings of living the gospel is that it refines us and helps us learn from our mistakes We all have sinned and come short of the glory of God 11 yet the Atonement of Jesus Christ has the power to make us whole when we repent Our beloved friend Elder Joseph B Wirthlin taught us this principle with clarity when he said Oh it is wonderful to know that our Heavenly Father loves us even with all our flaws His love is such that even should we give up on ourselves He never will We might see ourselves in terms of yesterday and today Our Heavenly Father sees us in terms of forever The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of transformation It takes us as men and women of the earth and refines us into men and women for the eternities 12To those who have left the path of discipleship for whatever reason I invite you to start where you are and come to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Walk again in the way of the Lord I testify that the Lord will bless your life endow you with knowledge and joy beyond comprehension and distill upon you the supernal gifts of the Spirit It is always the right time to walk in His way It is never too late To those who feel inadequate because they have not been members of the Church all their lives to those who feel that they can never make up for the time they have lost I testify that the Lord needs your specific abilities talents and skills The Church needs you we need you It is always the right time to walk in His way It is never too late The Blessings of DiscipleshipLet us remember on this Palm Sunday during this Easter season and always that the restored gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has the power to fill any emptiness heal any wound and bridge any vale of sorrow It is the way of hope faith and trust in the Lord The gospel of Jesus Christ is taught in its fulness in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints This Church is led by a living prophet authorized by the Lord Jesus Christ to provide direction and guidance to help us face the challenges of our day as serious as they may be I bear my solemn witness that Jesus the Christ lives He is the Savior and Redeemer of the world He is the promised Messiah He lived a perfect life and atoned for our sins He will ever be at our side He will fight our battles He is our hope He is our salvation He is the way Of this I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brethren I have known for a few months the message I want to give to you today During that time I have searched for a story that would illustrate what I want to say I looked for a story about farming I looked for a story about animals In honor of Elder Scott I looked for a story about nuclear engineering and in honor of President Monson one about raising pigeons In the end one story kept coming back to me a story that has been imprinted on my memory for many many years It isn t about farming animals nuclear engineering or pigeons It is as you might have guessed about aviation I call it The Story of the Lightbulb The Story of the Lightbulb or Losing Sight of What Matters MostOn a dark December night 36 years ago a Lockheed 1011 jumbo jet crashed into the Florida Everglades killing over 100 people This terrible accident was one of the deadliest crashes in the history of the United States A curious thing about this accident is that all vital parts and systems of the airplane were functioning perfectly the plane could have easily landed safely at its destination in Miami only 20 miles 32km away During the final approach however the crew noticed that one green light had failed to illuminate a light that indicates whether or not the nose landing gear has extended successfully The pilots discontinued the approach set the aircraft into a circling holding pattern over the pitch black Everglades and turned their attention toward investigating the problem They became so preoccupied with their search that they failed to realize the plane was gradually descending closer and closer toward the dark swamp below By the time someone noticed what was happening it was too late to avoid the disaster After the accident investigators tried to determine the cause The landing gear had indeed lowered properly The plane was in perfect mechanical condition Everything was working properly all except one thing a single burned out lightbulb That tiny bulb worth about 20 cents started the chain of events that ultimately led to the tragic death of over 100 people Of course the malfunctioning lightbulb didn t cause the accident it happened because the crew placed its focus on something that seemed to matter at the moment while losing sight of what mattered most Set Your Heart on Things That Matter MostThe tendency to focus on the insignificant at the expense of the profound happens not only to pilots but to everyone We are all at risk The driver who focuses on the road has a far greater chance of arriving at his destination accident free than the driver who focuses on sending text messages on his phone We know what matters most in life the Light of Christ teaches this to everyone We as faithful Latter day Saints have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to teach us the things of eternal value I imagine that any priesthood holder listening to my voice today if asked to prepare a talk on the subject what matters most could and would do an excellent job Our weakness is in failing to align our actions with our conscience Pause for a moment and check where your own heart and thoughts are Are you focused on the things that matter most How you spend your quiet time may provide a valuable clue Where do your thoughts go when the pressure of deadlines is gone Are your thoughts and heart focused on those short lived fleeting things that matter only in the moment or on things that matter most What grudges do you bear What excuses do you cling to that keep you from being the kind of husband father son and priesthood holder you know you should be What are the things that distract you from your duties or hinder you from magnifying your calling more diligently Sometimes the things that distract us are not bad in and of themselves often they even make us feel good It is possible to take even good things to excess One example can be seen in a father or grandfather who spends hours upon hours searching for his ancestors or creating a blog while neglecting or avoiding quality or meaningful time with his own children and grandchildren Another example could be a gardener who spends his days pulling weeds from the soil while ignoring the spiritual weeds that threaten to choke his soul Even some programs of the Church can become a distraction if we take them to extremes and allow them to dominate our time and our attention at the expense of things that matter most We need balance in life When we truly love our Heavenly Father and His children we demonstrate that love through our actions We forgive one another and seek to do good for our old self is crucified with Christ 1 We visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and we keep ourselves unspotted from the vices of the world 2My dear brethren of the priesthood we live in the latter days The gospel of Jesus Christ is restored to the earth The keys of the priesthood of God are given again to man We live in an era of anticipation and preparation entrusted by God to prepare ourselves our families our world for the approaching dawn the day when the Son of God will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God 3 and usher in His millennial reign We have been entrusted with the holy priesthood and charged with the responsibility power and right to act as agents of our Heavenly King These are the things that matter most These are the things of eternal value that deserve our attention We cannot and we must not allow ourselves to get distracted from our sacred duty We cannot and we must not lose focus on the things that matter most NehemiahNehemiah of the Old Testament is a great example of staying focused and committed to an important task Nehemiah was an Israelite who lived in exile in Babylon and served as cupbearer to the king One day the king asked Nehemiah why he seemed so sad Nehemiah replied Why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my fathers graves lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire 4When the king heard this his heart was softened and he gave Nehemiah the authority to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city However not everyone was happy with this plan In fact several rulers who lived near Jerusalem grieved exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel 5 These men took great indignation and mocked the Jews 6Fearless Nehemiah did not allow the opposition to distract him Instead he organized his resources and manpower and moved forward rebuilding the city for the people had a mind to work 7But as the walls of the city began to rise opposition intensified Nehemiah s enemies threatened conspired and ridiculed Their threats were very real and they grew so intimidating that Nehemiah confessed They all made us afraid 8 In spite of the danger and the ever present threat of invasion the work progressed It was a time of stress for every builder had his sword girded by his side and so builded 9As the work continued Nehemiah s enemies became more desperate Four times they entreated him to leave the safety of the city and meet with them under the pretense of resolving the conflict but Nehemiah knew that their intent was to do him harm Each time they approached him he responded with the same answer I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down 10What a remarkable response With that clear and unchanging purpose of heart and mind with that great resolve the walls of Jerusalem rose until they were rebuilt in an astonishing 52 days 11Nehemiah refused to allow distractions to prevent him from doing what the Lord wanted him to do We Will Not Come DownI am encouraged and inspired by the many faithful priesthood holders today who are of similar heart and mind Like Nehemiah you love the Lord and seek to magnify the priesthood you bear The Lord loves you and is mindful of the purity of your hearts and the steadfastness of your resolve He blesses you for your fidelity guides your path and uses your gifts and talents in building His kingdom on this earth Nevertheless not all are like Nehemiah There is room for improvement I wonder my dear brethren of the priesthood what could be accomplished if we all like the people of Nehemiah had a mind to work I wonder what could be accomplished if we put away childish things 12 and gave ourselves heart and soul to becoming worthy priesthood bearers and true representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ Think for a moment what could be accomplished in our personal lives in our professional lives in our families in our wards and branches Think of how the kingdom of God would progress throughout the earth Imagine how the world itself could be transformed for good if every man who bears the priesthood of God were to gird up his loins and live up to his true potential converted in the depth of his soul a true and faithful priesthood man committed to building the kingdom of God It is easy to become distracted to become focused on one burned out lightbulb or the impolite acts of unkind people whatever their motive may be But think of the power we would have as individuals and as a body of the priesthood if in response to every temptation to lose focus or lower our standards the standards of God we responded I am doing a great work and cannot come down We live in times of great challenges and great opportunities The Lord is seeking men like Nehemiah faithful brethren who fulfill the oath and covenant of the priesthood He seeks to enlist unfaltering souls who diligently go about the work of building the kingdom of God those who when faced with opposition and temptation say in their hearts I am doing a great work and cannot come down When faced with trial and suffering they respond I am doing a great work and cannot come down When faced with ridicule and reproach they proclaim I am doing a great work and cannot come down Our Heavenly Father seeks those who refuse to allow the trivial to hinder them in their pursuit of the eternal He seeks those who will not allow the attraction of ease or the traps of the adversary to distract them from the work He has given them to perform He seeks those whose actions conform to their words those who say with conviction I am doing a great work and cannot come down I bear solemn testimony that God lives and is mindful of each one of us He will stretch forth His hand and uphold those who rise up and bear the priesthood with honor for in these latter days He has a great work for us to do This gospel does not come from man The doctrine of the Church is not someone s best guess as to the meaning of ancient scripture It is the truth of heaven revealed by God Himself I testify that Joseph Smith saw what he said he saw He truly looked into the heavens and communed with God the Father and the Son and with angels I bear witness that Heavenly Father speaks to those who seek Him in spirit and in truth I have witnessed with my own eyes and joyfully testify that in our day God speaks through His prophet seer and revelator even Thomas S Monson My dear brethren like Nehemiah we have a great work to do We stand overlooking the horizon of our age It is my fervent prayer that in spite of temptations we will never lower our standards that in spite of distractions wherever they may come from we will not lose focus on what matters most that we will stand resolute and together shoulder to shoulder as we valiantly bear the banner of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray that we may be worthy of the holy priesthood of Almighty God and to a man lift our heads and with unwavering voice proclaim to the world We are doing a great work and we will not come down In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters and friends what a glorious day for us to witness the announcement of five new temples by our beloved prophet What a beautiful day for all of us Toward the end of World War II my father was drafted into the German army and sent to the western front leaving my mother alone to care for our family Though I was only three years old I can still remember this time of fear and hunger We lived in Czechoslovakia and with every passing day the war came nearer and the danger grew greater Finally during the cold winter of 1944 my mother decided to flee to Germany where her parents were living She bundled us up and somehow managed to get us on one of the last refugee trains heading west Traveling during that time was dangerous Everywhere we went the sound of explosions the stressed faces and ever present hunger reminded us that we were in a war zone Along the way the train stopped occasionally to get supplies One night during one of these stops my mother hurried out of the train to search for some food for her four children When she returned to her great horror the train and her children were gone She was weighed down with worry desperate prayers filled her heart She frantically searched the large and dark train station urgently crisscrossing the numerous tracks while hoping against hope that the train had not already departed Perhaps I will never know all that went through my mother s heart and mind on that black night as she searched through a grim railroad station for her lost children That she was terrified I have no doubt I am certain it crossed her mind that if she did not find this train she might never see her children again I know with certainty her faith overcame her fear and her hope overcame her despair She was not a woman who would sit and bemoan tragedy She moved She put her faith and hope into action And so she ran from track to track and from train to train until she finally found our train It had been moved to a remote area of the station There at last she found her children again I have often thought about that night and what my mother must have endured If I could go back in time and sit by her side I would ask her how she managed to go on in the face of her fears I would ask about faith and hope and how she overcame despair While that is impossible perhaps today I could sit by your side and by the side of any who might feel discouraged worried or lonely Today I would like to speak with you about the infinite power of hope The Importance of HopeHope is one leg of a three legged stool together with faith and charity These three stabilize our lives regardless of the rough or uneven surfaces we might encounter at the time The scriptures are clear and certain about the importance of hope The Apostle Paul taught that the scriptures were written to the end that we might have hope 1Hope has the power to fill our lives with happiness 2 Its absence when this desire of our heart is delayed can make the heart sick 3Hope is a gift of the Spirit 4 It is a hope that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the power of His Resurrection we shall be raised unto life eternal and this because of our faith in the Savior 5 This kind of hope is both a principle of promise as well as a commandment 6 and as with all commandments we have the responsibility to make it an active part of our lives and overcome the temptation to lose hope Hope in our Heavenly Father s merciful plan of happiness leads to peace 7 mercy 8 rejoicing 9 and gladness 10 The hope of salvation is like a protective helmet 11 it is the foundation of our faith12 and an anchor to our souls 13Moroni in his solitude even after having witnessed the complete destruction of his people believed in hope In the twilight of the Nephite nation Moroni wrote that without hope we cannot receive an inheritance in the kingdom of God 14But Why Then Is There Despair The scriptures say that there must be an opposition in all things 15 So it is with faith hope and charity Doubt despair and failure to care for our fellowmen lead us into temptation which can cause us to forfeit choice and precious blessings The adversary uses despair to bind hearts and minds in suffocating darkness Despair drains from us all that is vibrant and joyful and leaves behind the empty remnants of what life was meant to be Despair kills ambition advances sickness pollutes the soul and deadens the heart Despair can seem like a staircase that leads only and forever downward Hope on the other hand is like the beam of sunlight rising up and above the horizon of our present circumstances It pierces the darkness with a brilliant dawn It encourages and inspires us to place our trust in the loving care of an eternal Heavenly Father who has prepared a way for those who seek for eternal truth in a world of relativism confusion and of fear What Then Is Hope The complexities of language offer several variations and intensities of the word hope For example a toddler may hope for a toy phone an adolescent may hope for a phone call from a special friend and an adult may simply hope that the phone will stop ringing altogether I wish to speak today of the hope that transcends the trivial and centers on the Hope of Israel 16 the great hope of mankind even our Redeemer Jesus Christ Hope is not knowledge 17 but rather the abiding trust that the Lord will fulfill His promise to us It is confidence that if we live according to God s laws and the words of His prophets now we will receive desired blessings in the future 18 It is believing and expecting that our prayers will be answered It is manifest in confidence optimism enthusiasm and patient perseverance In the language of the gospel this hope is sure unwavering and active The prophets of old speak of a firm hope 19 and a lively hope 20 It is a hope glorifying God through good works With hope comes joy and happiness 21 With hope we can have patience and bear our afflictions 22Things We Hope For Things We Hope InThe things we hope for are often future events If only we could look beyond the horizon of mortality into what awaits us beyond this life Is it possible to imagine a more glorious future than the one prepared for us by our Heavenly Father Because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ we need not fear for we will live forever never to taste of death again 23 Because of His infinite Atonement we can be cleansed of sin and stand pure and holy before the judgment bar 24 The Savior is the Author of our Salvation 25And what kind of existence can we hope for Those who come unto Christ repent of their sins and live in faith will reside forever in peace Think of the worth of this eternal gift Surrounded by those we love we will know the meaning of ultimate joy as we progress in knowledge and in happiness No matter how bleak the chapter of our lives may look today because of the life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ we may hope and be assured that the ending of the book of our lives will exceed our grandest expectations Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 26The things we hope in sustain us during our daily walk They uphold us through trials temptations and sorrow Everyone has experienced discouragement and difficulty Indeed there are times when the darkness may seem unbearable It is in these times that the divine principles of the restored gospel we hope in can uphold us and carry us until once again we walk in the light We hope in Jesus the Christ in the goodness of God in the manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the knowledge that prayers are heard and answered Because God has been faithful and kept His promises in the past we can hope with confidence that God will keep His promises to us in the present and in the future In times of distress we can hold tightly to the hope that things will work together for our good 27 as we follow the counsel of God s prophets This type of hope in God His goodness and His power refreshes us with courage during difficult challenges and gives strength to those who feel threatened by enclosing walls of fear doubt and despair Hope Leads to Good WorksWe learn to cultivate hope the same way we learn to walk one step at a time As we study the scriptures speak with our Heavenly Father daily commit to keep the commandments of God like the Word of Wisdom and to pay a full tithing we attain hope 28 We grow in our ability to abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost 29 as we more perfectly live the gospel There may be times when we must make a courageous decision to hope even when everything around us contradicts this hope Like Father Abraham we will against hope believe in hope 30 Or as one writer expressed in the depth of winter we find within us an invincible summer 31Faith hope and charity complement each other and as one increases the others grow as well Hope comes of faith 32 for without faith there is no hope 33 In like manner faith comes of hope for faith is the substance of things hoped for 34Hope is critical to both faith and charity When disobedience disappointment and procrastination erode faith hope is there to uphold our faith When frustration and impatience challenge charity hope braces our resolve and urges us to care for our fellowmen even without expectation of reward The brighter our hope the greater our faith The stronger our hope the purer our charity The things we hope for lead us to faith while the things we hope in lead us to charity The three qualities faith hope and charity35 working together grounded on the truth and light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ lead us to abound in good works 36Hope from Personal ExperienceEach time a hope is fulfilled it creates confidence and leads to greater hope I can think of many instances in my life where I learned firsthand the power of hope I well remember the days in my childhood encompassed by the horrors and despair of a world war the lack of educational opportunities life threatening health issues during youth and the challenging and discouraging economic experiences as a refugee The example of our mother even in the worst of times to move forward and put faith and hope into action not just worrying or wishful thinking sustained our family and me and gave confidence that present circumstances would give way to future blessings I know from these experiences that it is the gospel of Jesus Christ and our membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints that strengthen faith offer a bright hope and lead us to charity Hope sustains us through despair Hope teaches that there is reason to rejoice even when all seems dark around us With Jeremiah I proclaim Blessed is the man whose hope the Lord is 37With Joel I testify The Lord is the hope of his people and the strength of the children of Israel 38With Nephi I declare Press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men Wherefore if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end behold thus saith the Father Ye shall have eternal life 39This is the quality of hope we must cherish and develop Such a mature hope comes in and through our Savior Jesus Christ for every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as the Savior is pure 40The Lord has given us a reassuring message of hope Fear not little flock 41 God will wait with open arms to receive 42 those who give away their sins and continue in faith hope and charity And to all who suffer to all who feel discouraged worried or lonely I say with love and deep concern for you never give in Never surrender Never allow despair to overcome your spirit Embrace and rely upon the Hope of Israel for the love of the Son of God pierces all darkness softens all sorrow and gladdens every heart Of this I testify and leave you my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Beloved brethren I am honored to be with you at this worldwide priesthood gathering With you I am so grateful to be in the presence of our beloved prophet President Thomas S Monson and President Eyring Brethren we thank you for your faithfulness and moral strength It is indeed a privilege and a joy to be part of this great brotherhood Lift Where You StandSome years ago in our meetinghouse in Darmstadt Germany a group of brethren was asked to move a grand piano from the chapel to the adjoining cultural hall where it was needed for a musical event None were professional movers and the task of getting that gravity friendly instrument through the chapel and into the cultural hall seemed nearly impossible Everybody knew that this task required not only physical strength but also careful coordination There were plenty of ideas but not one could keep the piano balanced correctly They repositioned the brethren by strength height and age over and over again nothing worked As they stood around the piano uncertain of what to do next a good friend of mine Brother Hanno Luschin spoke up He said Brethren stand close together and lift where you stand It seemed too simple Nevertheless each lifted where he stood and the piano rose from the ground and moved into the cultural hall as if on its own power That was the answer to the challenge They merely needed to stand close together and lift where they stood I have often thought of Brother Luschin s simple idea and have been impressed by its profound truth Tonight I would like to expand on that simple concept lift where you stand Some Want to Lead Others Want to HideAlthough it may seem simple lifting where we stand is a principle of power Most of the priesthood bearers I know understand and live by this principle They are eager to roll up their sleeves and go to work whatever that work might be They faithfully perform their priesthood duties They magnify their callings They serve the Lord by serving others They stand close together and lift where they stand However there are those who sometimes struggle with this concept And when they do they seem to fall into one of two camps either they seek to lead or they seek to hide They covet a crown or a cave Those Who Seek to LeadThose who seek to lead may feel they are capable of doing more than what they are currently asked to do Some might think If only I were a bishop I could make a difference They believe that their abilities far surpass their calling Perhaps if they were in an important position of leadership they would work hard at making a difference But they wonder What possible influence can I have as merely a home teacher or a counselor in the quorum presidency Those Who Seek to HideThose who seek to hide may feel that they are too busy to serve in the Church When the chapel needs to be cleaned when the Mendez family needs help moving when the bishop calls them to teach a class they always seem to have a ready excuse Twenty years ago President Ezra Taft Benson shared reports from bishops and stake presidents that some members are turning down calls to serve claiming they are too busy or they haven t got time Others accept such callings but refuse to magnify those callings President Benson went on to say The Lord expects each of us to have a calling in His Church so that others may be blessed by our talents and influence 1Oddly enough often the root cause of both of these tendencies seeking to lead or seeking to hide may be the same selfishness A Better WayThere is a better way taught to us by the Savior Himself Whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant 2When we seek to serve others we are motivated not by selfishness but by charity This is the way Jesus Christ lived His life and the way a holder of the priesthood must live his The Savior did not care for the honors of men Satan offered Him all the kingdoms and glory of the world and Jesus rejected the offer immediately and completely 3 Throughout His life the Savior must have often felt tired and pressed upon with scarcely a moment to Himself yet He always made time for the sick the sorrowful and the overlooked In spite of this shining example we too easily and too often get caught up in seeking the honors of men rather than serving the Lord with all our might mind and strength Brethren when we stand before the Lord to be judged will He look upon the positions we have held in the world or even in the Church Do you suppose that titles we have had other than husband father or priesthood holder will mean much to Him Do you think He will care how packed our schedule was or how many important meetings we attended Do you suppose that our success in filling our days with appointments will serve as an excuse for failure to spend time with our wife and family The Lord judges so very differently from the way we do He is pleased with the noble servant not with the self serving noble Those who are humble in this life will wear crowns of glory in the next Jesus taught this doctrine Himself when He told the story of the rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and ate sumptuously every day while the beggar Lazarus yearned merely to taste of the crumbs from the rich man s table In the next life Lazarus appeared in glory next to Abraham while the rich man was cast into hell where he lifted up his eyes in torment 4The Example of John Rowe MoyleThis year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of John Rowe Moyle John was a convert to the Church who left his home in England and traveled to the Salt Lake Valley as part of a handcart company He built a home for his family in a small town a valley away from Salt Lake City John was an accomplished stonecutter and because of this skill was asked to work on the Salt Lake Temple Every Monday John left home at two o clock in the morning and walked six hours in order to be at his post on time On Friday he would leave his work at five o clock in the evening and walk almost until midnight before arriving home He did this year after year One day while he was doing his chores at home a cow kicked him in the leg causing a compound fracture With limited medical resources the only option was to amputate the broken leg So John s family and friends strapped him onto a door and with a bucksaw cut off his leg a few inches from the knee In spite of the crude surgery the leg started to heal Once John could sit up in bed he began carving a wooden leg with an ingenious joint that served as an ankle to an artificial foot Walking on this device was extremely painful but John did not give up building up his endurance until he could make the 22 mile 35 km journey to the Salt Lake Temple each week where he continued his work His hands carved the words Holiness to the Lord that stand today as a golden marker to all who visit the Salt Lake Temple 5John did not do this for the praise of man Neither did he shirk his duty even though he had every reason to do so He knew what the Lord expected him to do Years later John s grandson Henry D Moyle was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and eventually served in the First Presidency of the Church President Moyle s service in these callings was honorable but his grandfather John s service though somewhat less public is just as pleasing to the Lord John s character his legacy of sacrifice serves as a banner of faithfulness and an ensign of duty to his family and to the Church John Rowe Moyle understood the meaning of lift where you stand The Example of Helaman s 2 000 WarriorsIndividual recognition is rarely an indication of the value of our service We do not know the names for example of any of the 2 000 sons of Helaman As individuals they are unnamed As a group however their name will always be remembered for honesty courage and the willingness to serve They accomplished together what none of them could have accomplished alone That is a lesson for us brethren of the priesthood When we stand close together and lift where we stand when we care more for the glory of the kingdom of God than for our own prestige or pleasure we can accomplish so much more Every Calling Is an Opportunity to Serve and GrowNo calling is beneath us Every calling provides an opportunity to serve and to grow The Lord organized the Church in a way that offers each member an opportunity for service which in turn leads to personal spiritual growth Whatever your calling I urge you to see it as an opportunity not only to strengthen and bless others but also to become what Heavenly Father wants you to become When traveling to the stakes of Zion for the purpose of reorganizing a stake presidency I have sometimes been surprised when during an interview a brother would tell me that he had received an impression that he would be in the next presidency When I first heard this I wasn t sure how to react It took some time before the Holy Spirit gave me understanding I believe that the Lord has a certain calling for every man Sometimes He grants spiritual promptings telling us that we are worthy to receive certain callings This is a spiritual blessing a tender mercy from God But sometimes we do not hear the rest of what the Lord is telling us Although you are worthy to serve in this position He may say this is not my calling for you It is my desire instead that you lift where you stand God knows what is best for us An Assignment Only You Can PerformEvery priesthood holder stands at a unique place and has an important task that only he can perform We all have heard stories of how President Monson visits and blesses the elderly and the sick always attending to their needs and bringing them cheer comfort and love President Monson has a natural way about him that makes people feel better about themselves Wouldn t it be wonderful if President Monson could visit and watch over every family in the Church It would But of course he can t and he shouldn t The Lord has not asked him to do that The Lord has asked us as home teachers to love and watch over our assigned families The Lord has not asked President Monson to organize and conduct our family home evening He wants us as fathers to do this You may feel that there are others who are more capable or more experienced who could fulfill your callings and assignments better than you can but the Lord gave you your responsibilities for a reason There may be people and hearts only you can reach and touch Perhaps no one else could do it in quite the same way Our Heavenly Father asks that we represent Him in the noble work of reaching out and blessing the lives of His children He asks us to stand firm with the power of the priesthood in our hearts and souls and give the calling we have at this moment our best efforts Brethren as strong as you are you cannot and you should not lift a piano by yourself Likewise none of us can or should move the Lord s work alone But if we all stand close together in the place the Lord has appointed and lift where we stand nothing can keep this divine work from moving upward and forward Brethren may we cease to aspire and cease to retire May we always remember this profound lesson that we are banner bearers of the Lord Jesus Christ upheld by the Holy Spirit of God faithful and true to the end each one devoted to give our all to the cause of Zion and bound by covenant to stand close together and lift where we stand For this I pray and I leave you my blessing and my love in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear sisters I am grateful for this my first opportunity to speak to the women of the Church gathered together in all parts of the world We are especially honored today with the presence of President Monson and President Eyring The choir has touched our hearts We have been inspired by the messages of Sister Thompson Sister Allred and Sister Beck Since learning that I would be with you today I have thought about the many women who have shaped my life my wonderful wife Harriet my mother my mother in law my sister my daughter my daughter in law and many friends All my life I have been surrounded by women who inspired taught and encouraged me I am who I am today in large part because of these singular women Each time I meet with the sisters of the Church I sense that I am in the midst of similar remarkable souls I am grateful to be here grateful for your talents compassion and service Most of all I am grateful for who you are treasured daughters of our Heavenly Father with infinite worth I m sure it comes as no surprise but the differences between men and women can often be quite striking physically and mentally as well as emotionally One of the best ways I can think of to illustrate this is in the way my wife and I cook a meal When Harriet prepares a meal it s a masterpiece Her cuisine is as wide ranging as the world and she frequently prepares dishes from countries we have visited The presentation of the food is awe inspiring In fact it often looks so beautiful that it seems a crime to eat it It s as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the sense of taste But sure enough no matter how perfect everything is looks and tastes Harriet will apologize for something she thinks is imperfect I m afraid I used a touch too much ginger she will say or Next time I think it would be better if I used a little more curry and one additional bay leaf Let me contrast that with the way I cook For the purpose of this talk I asked Harriet to tell me what I cook best Her answer fried eggs Sunny side up But that isn t all I have a specialty dish called Knusperchen The name may sound like a delicacy you might find at an exclusive restaurant Let me share with you how to make it You cut French bread into small slices and toast them twice That is the recipe So between fried eggs even when they are greasy and Knusperchen even when they are burned when I cook I feel pretty heroic Perhaps this contrast between my wife and me is a slight exaggeration but it illustrates something that may extend beyond preparing meals To me it appears that our splendid sisters sometimes undervalue their abilities they focus on what is lacking or imperfect rather than what has been accomplished and who they really are Perhaps you recognize this trait in someone you know really well The good news is that this also points to an admirable quality the innate desire to please the Lord to the best of your ability Unfortunately it can also lead to frustration exhaustion and unhappiness To All Who Are WearyToday I would like to speak to those who have ever felt inadequate discouraged or weary in short I would like to speak to all of us I also pray that the Holy Ghost will amplify my words and bestow upon them additional meaning insight and inspiration We know that sometimes it can be difficult to keep our heads above water In fact in our world of change challenges and checklists sometimes it can seem nearly impossible to avoid feeling overwhelmed by emotions of suffering and sorrow I am not suggesting that we can simply flip a switch and stop the negative feelings that distress us This isn t a pep talk or an attempt to encourage those sinking in quicksand to imagine instead they are relaxing on a beach I recognize that in all of our lives there are real concerns I know there are hearts here today that harbor deep sorrows Others wrestle with fears that trouble the soul For some loneliness is their secret trial These things are not insignificant However I would like to speak about two principles that may help you find a path to peace hope and joy even during times of trial and distress I want to speak about God s happiness and how each one of us can taste of it in spite of the burdens that beset us God s HappinessLet me first pose a question What do you suppose is the greatest kind of happiness possible For me the answer to this question is God s happiness This leads to another question What is our Heavenly Father s happiness This may be impossible to answer because His ways are not our ways For as the heavens are higher than the earth so are God s ways higher than our ways and His thoughts higher than our thoughts 1Though we cannot understand the meaning of all things we do know that God loveth his children 2 because He has said Behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 3Heavenly Father is able to accomplish these two great goals the immortality and eternal life of man because He is a God of creation and compassion Creating and being compassionate are two objectives that contribute to our Heavenly Father s perfect happiness Creating and being compassionate are two activities that we as His spirit children can and should emulate The Work of CreationThe desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul No matter our talents education backgrounds or abilities we each have an inherent wish to create something that did not exist before Everyone can create You don t need money position or influence in order to create something of substance or beauty Creation brings deep satisfaction and fulfillment We develop ourselves and others when we take unorganized matter into our hands and mold it into something of beauty and I am not talking about the process of cleaning the rooms of your teenage children You might say I m not the creative type When I sing I m always half a tone above or below the note I cannot draw a line without a ruler And the only practical use for my homemade bread is as a paperweight or as a doorstop If that is how you feel think again and remember that you are spirit daughters of the most creative Being in the universe Isn t it remarkable to think that your very spirits are fashioned by an endlessly creative and eternally compassionate God Think about it your spirit body is a masterpiece created with a beauty function and capacity beyond imagination But to what end were we created We were created with the express purpose and potential of experiencing a fulness of joy 4 Our birthright and the purpose of our great voyage on this earth is to seek and experience eternal happiness One of the ways we find this is by creating things If you are a mother you participate with God in His work of creation not only by providing physical bodies for your children but also by teaching and nurturing them If you are not a mother now the creative talents you develop will prepare you for that day in this life or the next You may think you don t have talents but that is a false assumption for we all have talents and gifts every one of us 5 The bounds of creativity extend far beyond the limits of a canvas or a sheet of paper and do not require a brush a pen or the keys of a piano Creation means bringing into existence something that did not exist before colorful gardens harmonious homes family memories flowing laughter What you create doesn t have to be perfect So what if the eggs are greasy or the toast is burned Don t let fear of failure discourage you Don t let the voice of critics paralyze you whether that voice comes from the outside or the inside If you still feel incapable of creating start small Try to see how many smiles you can create write a letter of appreciation learn a new skill identify a space and beautify it Nearly a century and a half ago President Brigham Young spoke to the Saints of his day There is a great work for the Saints to do he said Progress and improve upon and make beautiful everything around you Cultivate the earth and cultivate your minds Build cities adorn your habitations make gardens orchards and vineyards and render the earth so pleasant that when you look upon your labors you may do so with pleasure and that angels may delight to come and visit your beautiful locations In the mean time continually seek to adorn your minds with all the graces of the Spirit of Christ 6The more you trust and rely upon the Spirit the greater your capacity to create That is your opportunity in this life and your destiny in the life to come Sisters trust and rely on the Spirit As you take the normal opportunities of your daily life and create something of beauty and helpfulness you improve not only the world around you but also the world within you Being CompassionateBeing compassionate is another great work of our Heavenly Father and a fundamental characteristic of who we are as a people We are commanded to succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 7 Disciples of Christ throughout all ages of the world have been distinguished by their compassion Those who follow the Savior mourn with those that mourn and comfort those that stand in need of comfort 8When we reach out to bless the lives of others our lives are blessed as well Service and sacrifice open the windows of heaven allowing choice blessings to descend upon us Surely our beloved Heavenly Father smiles upon those who care for the least of His children As we lift others we rise a little higher ourselves President Spencer W Kimball taught The more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways the more substance there is to our souls 9President Gordon B Hinckley believed in the healing power of service After the death of his wife he provided a great example to the Church in the way he immersed himself in work and in serving others It is told that President Hinckley remarked to one woman who had recently lost her husband Work will cure your grief Serve others These are profound words As we lose ourselves in the service of others we discover our own lives and our own happiness President Lorenzo Snow expressed a similar thought When you find yourselves a little gloomy look around you and find somebody that is in a worse plight than yourself go to him and find out what the trouble is then try to remove it with the wisdom which the Lord bestows upon you and the first thing you know your gloom is gone you feel light the Spirit of the Lord is upon you and everything seems illuminated 10In today s world of pop psychology junk TV and feel good self help manuals this advice may seem counterintuitive We are sometimes told that the answer to our ills is to look inward to indulge ourselves to spend first and pay later and to satisfy our own desires even at the expense of those around us While there are times when it is prudent to look first to our own needs in the long run it doesn t lead to lasting happiness An Instrument in the Hands of the LordI believe that the women of the Church regardless of age or family status understand and apply best the words of James Barrie the author of Peter Pan Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves 11 Often I have witnessed quiet acts of kindness and compassion by noble women who extended themselves in unselfish charity My heart swells when I hear stories of the sisters of the Church and how they rush to the aid of those in need There are those in the Church both men and women who wonder how they can contribute to the kingdom Sometimes women who are single divorced or widowed wonder if there is a place for them Every sister in the Church is of critical importance not only to our Heavenly Father but also to the building of the kingdom of God as well There is a great work to do One year ago in this meeting President Monson taught that you are surrounded by opportunities for service Often small acts of service are all that is required to lift and bless another 12 Look around you There at sacrament meeting is a young mother with several children offer to sit with her and help There in your neighborhood is a young man who seems discouraged tell him you enjoy being in his presence that you feel his goodness True words of encouragement require only a loving and caring heart but may have an eternal impact on the life of those around you You wonderful sisters render compassionate service to others for reasons that supersede desires for personal benefits In this you emulate the Savior who though a king did not seek position nor was He concerned about whether others noticed Him He did not bother to compete with others His thoughts were always tuned to help others He taught healed conversed and listened to others He knew that greatness had little to do with outward signs of prosperity or position He taught and lived by this doctrine He that is greatest among you shall be your servant 13In the end the number of prayers we say may contribute to our happiness but the number of prayers we answer may be of even greater importance Let us open our eyes and see the heavy hearts notice the loneliness and despair let us feel the silent prayers of others around us and let us be an instrument in the hands of the Lord to answer those prayers ConclusionMy dear sisters I have a simple faith I believe that as you are faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God as you draw closer to Him in faith hope and charity things will work together for your good 14 I believe that as you immerse yourselves in the work of our Father as you create beauty and as you are compassionate to others God will encircle you in the arms of His love 15 Discouragement inadequacy and weariness will give way to a life of meaning grace and fulfillment As spirit daughters of our Heavenly Father happiness is your heritage You are choice daughters of our Heavenly Father and through the things you create and by your compassionate service you are a great power for good You will make the world a better place Lift up your chin walk tall God loves you We love and admire you Of this I testify and leave you my blessing as an Apostle of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen

My dear brethren I feel your strength and goodness as we assemble as the priesthood of God I love you I admire you Thank you for your faith your prayers and your willingness to serve the Lord It is now two months since President Thomas S Monson called me to serve as Second Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church I am sure this came as a surprise to many and it caught me off guard as well In fact I would say I may have been the second most surprised person on earth the first being my wife On the day the Quorum of the Twelve met in the temple to sustain President Monson and ordain and set him apart as prophet seer and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I felt overjoyed to have the opportunity to raise my hand in support of my beloved friend and leader After President Monson was sustained he announced his counselors President Eyring was no surprise He is a man of stature and character a wonderful choice as First Counselor How I love and admire him Then President Monson announced his Second Counselor It was a name that sounded strangely familiar It was my name I looked around the room not sure I had heard correctly But the smiles from my brethren and the look of compassion from President Monson assured me that once again my life was about to change We all miss President Hinckley He continues to bless our lives President Monson is the prophet of God for our days I honor him and pledge my heart might mind and strength to this great work In 1979 a large passenger jet with 257 people on board left New Zealand for a sightseeing flight to Antarctica and back Unknown to the pilots however someone had modified the flight coordinates by a mere two degrees This error placed the aircraft 28 miles 45 km to the east of where the pilots assumed they were As they approached Antarctica the pilots descended to a lower altitude to give the passengers a better look at the landscape Although both were experienced pilots neither had made this particular flight before and they had no way of knowing that the incorrect coordinates had placed them directly in the path of Mount Erebus an active volcano that rises from the frozen landscape to a height of more than 12 000 feet 3 700 m As the pilots flew onward the white of the snow and ice covering the volcano blended with the white of the clouds above making it appear as though they were flying over flat ground By the time the instruments sounded the warning that the ground was rising fast toward them it was too late The airplane crashed into the side of the volcano killing everyone on board It was a terrible tragedy brought on by a minor error a matter of only a few degrees 1Through years of serving the Lord and in countless interviews I have learned that the difference between happiness and misery in individuals in marriages and families often comes down to an error of only a few degrees Saul the King of IsraelThe story of Saul the king of Israel illustrates this point Saul s life began with great promise but it had an unfortunate and tragic end In the beginning Saul was a choice young man and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he 2 Saul was personally chosen by God to be king 3 He had every advantage he was physically imposing 4 and he came from an influential family 5Of course Saul had weaknesses but the Lord promised to bless uphold and prosper him The scriptures tell us that God promised to always be with him 6 give him another heart 7 and turn him into another man 8When he had the Lord s help Saul was a magnificent king He united Israel and defeated the Ammonites who had invaded their land 9 Soon a much greater problem faced him the Philistines who had a terrible army with chariots and horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude 10 The Israelites were so terrified of the Philistines that they hid themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks 11The young king needed help The prophet Samuel sent word for him to wait and that he the prophet would come and offer sacrifice and seek counsel from the Lord Saul waited seven days and still the prophet Samuel had not arrived Finally Saul felt he could wait no longer He gathered the people together and did something he had no priesthood authority to do he offered the sacrifice himself When Samuel arrived he was brokenhearted Thou hast done foolishly he said If only the new king had endured a little longer and not deviated from the course of the Lord if only he had followed the revealed order of the priesthood the Lord would have established his kingdom forever But now Samuel said thy kingdom shall not continue 12On that day the prophet Samuel recognized a critical weakness in Saul s character When pressured by outside influences Saul did not have the self discipline to stay on course trust the Lord and His prophet and follow the pattern God had established Small Errors Can Have a Large Impact on Our LivesThe difference of a few degrees as with the Antarctica flight or Saul s failure to hold fast to the counsel of the prophet just a little longer may seem minor But even small errors over time can make a dramatic difference in our lives Let me share with you how I taught the same principle to young pilots Suppose you were to take off from an airport at the equator intending to circumnavigate the globe but your course was off by just one degree By the time you returned to the same longitude how far off course would you be A few miles A hundred miles The answer might surprise you An error of only one degree would put you almost 500 miles 800 km off course or one hour of flight for a jet No one wants his life to end in tragedy But all too often like the pilots and passengers of the sightseeing flight we set out on what we hope will be an exciting journey only to realize too late that an error of a few degrees has set us on a course for spiritual disaster Is There a Lesson for Our Lives in These Examples Small errors and minor drifts away from the doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ can bring sorrowful consequences into our lives It is therefore of critical importance that we become self disciplined enough to make early and decisive corrections to get back on the right track and not wait or hope that errors will somehow correct themselves The longer we delay corrective action the larger the needed changes become and the longer it takes to get back on the correct course even to the point where a disaster might be looming You men of the priesthood have been entrusted with a great responsibility Just think of it our Heavenly Father trusts you young deacons teachers and priests with the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel 13 You men of the Melchizedek Priesthood have received an oath and a covenant in which you have been promised all the Father has if you magnify your priesthood 14The Lord reminds us that unto whom much is given much is required 15 Those who bear the priesthood of God have a great responsibility to be examples of goodness to the world We live up to these expectations when we quickly recognize the dangers and influences that tempt us to drift from the Lord s way and when we courageously follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost to make decisive corrections that will bring us back on course This conference is being translated into 92 languages and broadcast to 96 countries by the miracle of modern technology Many of you brethren attend general conference by means of the Internet New technologies such as this make it possible for the gospel message to be spread throughout the world The Church Web sites are good examples of how you can use this technology as a wonderful resource of inspiration help and learning They can be a blessing for you priesthood holders your families and the Church But be cautious These same technologies can allow evil influences to cross the threshold of your homes These dangerous traps are only a mouse click away Pornography violence intolerance and ungodliness destroy families marriages and individual lives These dangers are distributed through many media including magazines books television movies and music as well as the Internet The Lord will help you to recognize and avoid those evils It is the early recognition of danger and a clear course correction that will keep you in the light of the gospel Minor decisions can lead to major consequences Entering a strange and risky chat room on the Internet could lead you into the center of a raging storm Putting a computer in a private room that the rest of the family cannot access could be the starting point for a deceitful and dangerous journey But the Lord requires not only outward acts but also your inner thoughts and feelings to be close to the spirit of the law 16 God require s the heart and a willing mind 17We the priesthood of God have the responsibility and the power of self direction It is not meet that I should command in all things saith the Lord Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of their own free will and bring to pass much righteousness for the power is in them wherein they are agents unto themselves 18Our Heavenly Father knew before we came to this mortal existence that negative forces would tempt us to drift from our course for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God 19 That is why He prepared a way for us to make corrections Through the merciful process of true repentance and the Atonement of Jesus Christ our sins can be forgiven and we will not perish but have everlasting life 20Our willingness to repent shows our gratitude for God s gift and for the Savior s love and sacrifice on our behalf Commandments and priesthood covenants provide a test of faith obedience and love for God and Jesus Christ but even more importantly they offer an opportunity to experience love from God and to receive a full measure of joy both in this life and in the life to come These commandments and covenants of God are like navigational instructions from celestial heights and will lead us safely to our eternal destination It is one of beauty and glory beyond understanding It is worth the effort It is worth making decisive corrections now and then staying on course Remember the heavens will not be filled with those who never made mistakes but with those who recognized that they were off course and who corrected their ways to get back in the light of gospel truth The more we treasure the words of the prophets and apply them the better we will recognize when we are drifting off course even if only by a matter of a few degrees What If We Have Drifted Far off Course Now brethren there are those who have neglected to make appropriate course corrections and now believe that they are too far from the Lord s way to ever make it back To them we proclaim the good news that is the gospel of redemption and salvation No matter how terribly off course you are no matter how far you have strayed the way back is certain and clear Come learn of the Father offer up a sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit Have faith and believe in the cleansing power of the infinite Atonement of Jesus the Christ If we confess and repent of our sins God is faithful and just to forgive and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 21 Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be made as white as snow 22It may not be an easy path and it requires self discipline and determination but its end is glorious beyond description You are not doomed to a tragic end Many are eager to assist you your family bishops and stake presidents your quorum leaders and home teachers Of course your greatest friend is the all powerful Creator of the universe It is His priesthood you bear He understands your sorrow He knows your grief He and our Father in Heaven will bless comfort and strengthen you They will walk beside you and carry you as you strive to right your course My dear brethren you are truly choice and precious sons of Heavenly Father He has entrusted you with the sacred power of the priesthood Please do not drift off course not even a few degrees Hearken unto the Lord your God and He will do for you what He promised to do for Saul He will give you a new heart make of you a new man and always be with you I testify of our Heavenly Father who knows and loves you I bear witness of Jesus Christ our Savior who is the head of this Church President Thomas S Monson is the prophet of God today I express my love and gratitude for you my dear friends and brethren of the priesthood In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
How blessed we are by the beautiful music of the Tabernacle Choir My dear brothers and sisters and friends I rejoice to stand with you today to have the great privilege of calling myself a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and to be counted as one among you I recall my initial reaction when I received this sacred call from the Lord to serve as the newest member of the First Presidency of this Church I felt joyfully overwhelmed Since then I have learned new dimensions of the words humility gratitude and faith I can assure you that no one was more surprised by my call than my children and grandchildren In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints we do not seek nor do we decline callings that come from God through inspired priesthood channels I pray that God will grant me strength and an understanding heart to magnify this sacred calling according to His will and purpose We all miss President Gordon B Hinckley His impact on this great work will continue to bless us I feel so privileged to work closely with President Monson I have known him for many years He is a man of amazing gifts and talents He is the prophet of God His faith and loving heart extend to every nation tongue and people I am grateful to serve with President Eyring whom I love and respect as a great leader and teacher in the kingdom of God When the Quorum of the Twelve met in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple to sustain President Monson as the 16th President of the Church I marveled at the extraordinary abilities wisdom and spirituality of those who surrounded me It made me recognize more clearly my own inadequacies I love these fine men of great faith I am grateful for the opportunity to raise my hand to sustain and pledge my support to them I do love and sustain Elder Christofferson the newest member of the Twelve When the Lord called Frederick G Williams to be a counselor to the Prophet Joseph Smith He commanded him to be faithful stand in the office which I have appointed unto you succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 1 I believe this counsel applies to all who accept callings to serve in the kingdom of God and certainly to me in this season of my life A Prophet of God and Our PresidentI would like to say a few words about President Thomas S Monson Some years ago President Monson came to a regional conference in Hamburg Germany and it was my honor to accompany him President Monson has a remarkable memory and we talked about many of the Saints in Germany I was amazed that he remembered so many so well President Monson asked about Brother Michael Panitsch a former stake president and then a patriarch who had been one of the stalwart pioneers of the Church in Germany I told him that Brother Panitsch was seriously ill that he was bedridden and unable to attend our meetings President Monson asked if we could pay him a visit I knew that shortly before his trip to Hamburg President Monson had undergone foot surgery and that he could not walk without pain I explained that Brother Panitsch lived on the fifth floor of a building with no elevators We would have to climb the stairs to see him But President Monson insisted And so we went I remember how difficult it was for President Monson to climb those stairs He could take only a few at a time before needing to stop and rest He never uttered a word of complaint and he would not turn back Because the building had high ceilings the stairs seemed to go on forever but President Monson cheerfully persevered until we arrived at the apartment of Brother Panitsch on the fifth floor Once there we had a wonderful visit President Monson thanked him for his life of dedicated service and cheered him with a smile Before we left he gave him a wonderful priesthood blessing No one but Brother Panitsch the immediate family and myself ever saw that act of courage and compassion President Monson could have chosen to rest between our long and frequent meetings He could have asked to see some of the beautiful sights of Hamburg I have often thought of how remarkable it was that of all the sights in that city the one he wanted to see more than any other was a feeble and ailing member of the Church who had faithfully and humbly served the Lord President Monson came to Hamburg to teach and bless the people of a country and that is what he did But at the same time he focused on the one name by name His vision is so broad and far reaching to grasp the complexities of a worldwide Church yet he is also so compassionate to focus on the one When the Apostle Peter spoke of Jesus who had been his friend and teacher he offered this simple description He went about doing good 2I feel the same can be said of the man we sustain today as the prophet of God The Faith of Our FathersI marvel at the different backgrounds of members of the Church You come from all walks of life all cultures languages political circumstances and religious traditions This multiplicity of life experiences has caused me to reflect on the message of one of our hymns Faith of Our Fathers In the refrain these words are repeated Faith of our fathers holy faith we will be true to thee till death 3The faith of our fathers I love that phrase For many members of the Church these words bring to mind valiant pioneers who abandoned the comfort of their homes and traveled by wagon and on foot until they reached the valley of the Great Salt Lake I love and honor the faith and courage of those early pioneers of the Church My own ancestors were living an ocean away at the time None were among those who lived in Nauvoo or Winter Quarters and none made the journey across the plains But as a member of the Church I claim with gratitude and pride this pioneer legacy as my own With the same joy I claim the legacies of today s modern day Church pioneers who live in every nation and whose own stories of perseverance faith and sacrifice add glorious new verses to the great chorus of the latter day anthem of the kingdom of God When my own family contemplates the phrase faith of our fathers often it is the Lutheran faith that comes to mind For generations our ancestors belonged to that denomination In fact my son recently discovered that one of our family lines connects back to Martin Luther himself We honor and respect sincere souls from all religions no matter where or when they lived who have loved God even without having the fulness of the gospel We lift our voices in gratitude for their selflessness and courage We embrace them as brothers and sisters children of our Heavenly Father We believe that it is a fundamental human right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience and allow all men the same privilege let them worship how where or what they may 4There Are Many Faiths and Traditions of Our FathersAs the restored Church of Jesus Christ blossoms throughout the globe now with more than 13 million members the faith of our fathers has an expanded meaning For some it could refer to their family s heritage in one of the hundreds of Christian faiths for others it could refer to Middle Eastern Asian or African faiths and traditions I have spent most of my life in areas of the world where members of our Church are a small minority During that time I have learned that often when people learn of the restored gospel they are impressed by it many even want to join the Church But they are reluctant to disappoint their ancestors they feel they should be true to the faith of their fathers I remember when I was a young man one Sunday I noticed a new family in our meetinghouse a young mother with two daughters It wasn t long before the three were baptized and became members of the Church I know the story of their conversion intimately because the oldest daughter s name was Harriet and later she would become my wife Harriet s mother Carmen had recently lost her husband and during a period of introspection she became interested in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints After studying the doctrines Carmen and her daughters knew the Church was true and made plans for baptism When Carmen told her mother about this decision however her mother was devastated How can you be so unfaithful to the faith of your fathers she asked Carmen s mother was not the only one who objected Carmen s strong willed sister Lisa was every bit as troubled by the news Perhaps troubled is too soft a word She was very angry Lisa said that she would find those young missionaries and tell them just how wrong they were She marched to the chapel and found the missionaries and you guessed it Lisa was baptized too Many years later Carmen s mother also received a testimony that the gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored to the earth One day she said to her daughters and grandchildren I want to be in the same heaven as you While in her mid 70s she too entered the waters of baptism and became a member of the Church The Faith of Our FatherWhat then is the faith of our fathers Is it the religion of our parents grandparents and great grandparents But what of the faith of the ancient ones before them What of Abraham Isaac and Jacob Are they not our fathers Are we not of the house of Israel What of Noah and Enoch and our first parents Adam and Eve What of the Savior and those disciples who followed Him The faith of our Father in Heaven has been consistent since the beginning of time even from before the foundation of this world John the Revelator described a great war in heaven 5 The issue was moral agency as it is today All who have ever lived on this earth were among those who fought against Satan and stood with the Son and the Father Therefore do we not owe our allegiance to God our Heavenly Father As members of the Church of Jesus Christ we believe in God the Eternal Father and in His Son Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost 6 And we believe that through the Atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel 7 We believe in the great plan of happiness the plan of redemption the plan of salvation whereby God s children may experience mortality and return to the presence of the Father a merciful plan established from before the foundation of this earth This is the plan and the faith of our Father I testify that the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the faith of our Heavenly Father It is His truth revealed to His servants the prophets from the days of Father Adam until our own time The Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith to restore the faith of our Father on this earth never to be taken away again God desires that all of His children receive it irrespective of their background culture or tradition True religion should not originate from what pleases men or the traditions of ancestors but rather from what pleases God our Eternal Father Continuing revelation is a fundamental feature of this faith Joseph Smith s first prayer is a powerful testimony of this Revelation is a constant compass that keeps us always true to the will and the faith of our Heavenly Father Our Heavenly Father loves His children He hears the prayers of the humble and sincere of every nation tongue and people He grants light to those who seek and honor Him and are willing to obey His commandments We joyously proclaim that the faith of our Father is on the earth today We invite everyone on this beautiful planet to taste of His doctrine and see if it is not sweet and good and precious We ask those of sincere heart to learn of this doctrine and ask their Father in Heaven if it is not true And by doing so all can discover embrace and walk in the true faith of their Father which faith will make them whole 8That is our message to the world I bear solemn witness of the reality of God the Father His Son Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost and living prophets who hold the keys which have come in unbroken succession from Joseph Smith to Thomas S Monson today In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I still rejoice in the wonderful spirit we felt as we sang together this morning Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation No longer as strangers on earth need we roam Good tidings are sounding to us and each nation These words by Brother William W Phelps are quite a contrast to the world s tendency to focus on bad news It is true we live in a time foretold in the scriptures as a day of wars rumors of wars and earthquakes in divers places Mormon 8 30 when the whole earth shall be in commotion and men s hearts shall fail them D C 45 26 But how does this affect us as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Are we living with apprehension fear and worry Or have we amidst all of our challenges not reason to rejoice We all go through different life experiences Some are filled with joy and others with sorrow and uncertainty I remember a time when things didn t look good for our family when I was a child It was in the winter of 1944 one of the coldest during World War II The war front was approaching our town and my mother had to take us four children leave all our possessions behind and join the millions of fleeing refugees in a desperate search for a place to survive Our father was still in the military but he and Mother had agreed that if they were ever separated during the war they would try to reunite at the hometown of my grandparents They felt this place offered the greatest hope for shelter and safety With bombing raids during the night and air attacks during the day it took us many days to reach my grandparents My memories of those days are of darkness and coldness My father returned to us unharmed but our future looked extremely bleak We were living in the rubble of postwar Germany with a devastating feeling of hopelessness and darkness about our future In the middle of this despair my family learned about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and the healing message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ This message made all the difference it lifted us above our daily misery Life was still thorny and the circumstances still horrible but the gospel brought light hope and joy into our lives The plain and simple truths of the gospel warmed our hearts and enlightened our minds They helped us look at ourselves and the world around us with different eyes and from an elevated viewpoint My dear brothers and sisters aren t the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and our membership in His Church great reasons to rejoice Wherever you live on this earth and whatever your life s situation may be I testify to you that the gospel of Jesus Christ has the divine power to lift you to great heights from what appears at times to be an unbearable burden or weakness The Lord knows your circumstances and your challenges He said to Paul and to all of us My grace is sufficient for thee And like Paul we can answer My strength is made perfect in weakness Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me 2 Corinthians 12 9 As members of the Church of Jesus Christ we may claim the blessings promised in the covenants and the ordinances we received when we accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ What Is the Gospel of Jesus Christ The gospel of Jesus Christ is good news glad tidings and much more It is the message of salvation as repeatedly announced by Jesus Christ and His apostles and prophets It is my firm belief that all truth and light originating with God is embraced in the gospel of Jesus Christ God our loving Father in Heaven has said that it is His work and glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 God the Father is the author of the gospel it is a key part of God s plan of salvation or plan of redemption It is called the gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the Atonement of Jesus Christ that makes redemption and salvation possible Through the Atonement all men women and children are unconditionally redeemed from physical death and all will be redeemed from their own sins on the condition of accepting and obeying the gospel of Jesus Christ see D C 20 17 25 76 40 42 50 53 Moses 6 62 Christ s gospel is the only true gospel and there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men only in and through the name of Christ Mosiah 3 17 see also Acts 4 12 The core elements of the gospel message are found in all the holy scriptures but are most clearly given to us in the Book of Mormon and in the revelations to the Prophet Joseph Smith Here Jesus Himself plainly declares His doctrine and His gospel with which God s children must comply to have eternal life D C 14 7 see also 3 Nephi 11 31 39 27 13 21 D C 33 11 12 The gospel is clear and plain It answers the most complex questions in life yet even a young child can comprehend and apply it As Nephi said My soul delighteth in plainness for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding for he speaketh unto men according to their language unto their understanding 2 Nephi 31 3 The Prophet Joseph Smith followed the same pattern of clarity and plainness when he explained to the world in a very concise way the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel Articles of Faith 1 4 which we must accept to receive the eternal blessings of the gospel First faith in the Lord Jesus Christ believing in the Redeemer the Son of God with unshaken faith in him relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save and then pressing forward with a steadfastness in Christ feasting upon the word of Christ 2 Nephi 31 19 20 Second repentance which includes a change of mind offering up a sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit giving up sin and becoming meek and humble as a little child 3 Nephi 9 20 22 Third baptism by immersion for the remission of sins and as a covenant to keep the commandments of God and take upon us the name of Christ Fourth laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost also known as baptism by fire which sanctifies us and makes us new creatures born of God Mosiah 27 26 see also 1 Peter 1 23 The gift of the Holy Ghost given to us by our Heavenly Father and administered by one having authority includes the merciful promise If ye will enter in by the way and receive the Holy Ghost it will show unto you all things what ye should do 2 Nephi 32 5 Through the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost every member of the Church can receive the words of Christ directly 2 Nephi 32 3 at any time or place This personal divine guidance helps us to remain valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ and endure to the end of our days Isn t this wonderful Have we not reason to rejoice What Does It Mean to Endure to the End The scriptures teach us that once we have received the ordinances of baptism and confirmation our task then is to endure to the end 2 Nephi 31 20 When I was a young boy endure to the end meant to me mainly that I had to try harder to stay awake until the end of our Church meetings Later as a teenager I progressed only slightly in my understanding of this scriptural phrase I linked it with youthful empathy to the efforts of our dear elderly members to hang in there until the end of their lives Enduring to the end or remaining faithful to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout our life is a fundamental requirement for salvation in the kingdom of God This belief distinguishes Latter day Saints from many other Christian denominations that teach that salvation is given to all who simply believe and confess that Jesus is the Christ The Lord clearly declared If you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God D C 14 7 Therefore enduring to the end is not just a matter of passively tolerating life s difficult circumstances or hanging in there Ours is an active religion helping God s children along the strait and narrow path to develop their full potential during this life and return to Him one day Viewed from this perspective enduring to the end is exalting and glorious not grim and gloomy This is a joyful religion one of hope strength and deliverance Adam fell that men might be and men are that they might have joy 2 Nephi 2 25 Enduring to the end is a process filling every minute of our life every hour every day from sunrise to sunrise It is accomplished through personal discipline following the commandments of God The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is a way of life It is not for Sunday only It is not something we can do only as a habit or a tradition if we expect to harvest all of its promised blessings Be not deceived God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap Galatians 6 7 Enduring to the end implies patient continuance in well doing Romans 2 7 striving to keep the commandments see 2 Nephi 31 10 and doing the works of righteousness see D C 59 23 It requires sacrifice and hard work To endure to the end we need to trust our Father in Heaven and make wise choices including paying our tithes and offerings honoring our temple covenants and serving the Lord and one another willingly and faithfully in our Church callings and responsibilities It means strength of character selflessness and humility it means integrity and honesty to the Lord and our fellowmen It means making our homes strong places of defense and a refuge against worldly evils it means loving and honoring our spouses and children By doing our best to endure to the end a beautiful refinement will come into our lives We will learn to do good to them that hate us and pray for them which despitefully use us Matthew 5 44 The blessings that come to us from enduring to the end in this life are real and very significant and for the life to come they are beyond our comprehension Jesus Christ Wants You to SucceedMy dear brothers and sisters there will be days and nights when you feel overwhelmed when your hearts are heavy and your heads hang down Then please remember Jesus Christ the Redeemer is the Head of this Church It is His gospel He wants you to succeed He gave His life for just this purpose He is the Son of the living God He has promised Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Matthew 11 28 For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee 3 Nephi 22 10 I have mercy on thee saith the Lord thy Redeemer 3 Nephi 22 8 My dear friends the Savior heals the broken heart and binds up your wounds see Psalm 147 3 Whatever your challenges may be wherever you live on this earth your faithful membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and the divine powers of the gospel of Jesus Christ will bless you to endure joyfully to the end Of this I bear witness with all my heart and mind in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
During my training to become an airline captain I had to learn how to navigate an airplane over long distances Flights over huge oceans crossing extensive deserts and connecting continents need careful planning to ensure a safe arrival at the planned destination Some of these nonstop flights can last up to 14 hours and cover almost 9 000 miles There is an important decision point during such long flights commonly known as the point of safe return Up to this point the aircraft has enough fuel to turn around and return safely to the airport of departure Having passed the point of safe return the captain has lost this option and has to continue on That is why this point is often referred to as the point of no return Are There Points of No Return in Our Lives Satan the father of all lies 2 Nephi 2 18 the father of contention 3 Nephi 11 29 the author of all sin Helaman 6 30 and the enemy unto God Moroni 7 12 uses the forces of evil to convince us that this concept applies whenever we have sinned The scriptures call him the accuser because he wants us to feel that we are beyond forgiveness see Revelation 12 10 Satan wants us to think that when we have sinned we have gone past a point of no return that it is too late to change our course In our beautiful but also troubled world it is a sad reality that this attitude is the source of great sorrow grief and distress to families marriages and individual lives Satan tries to counterfeit the work of God and by doing this he may deceive many To make us lose hope feel miserable like himself and believe that we are beyond forgiveness Satan might even misuse words from the scriptures that emphasize the justice of God in order to imply that there is no mercy What Is the Lord s Plan for Our Safe Return Protection against the influence of the devil comes through the gospel of Jesus Christ It is the good news that Jesus Christ has made a perfect Atonement for mankind It is the message of love hope and mercy that there is a reconciliation of man with God Sin is the willful transgression of divine law The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the gift of God to His children to correct and overcome the consequences of sin God loves all of His children and He will never cease to love and to hope for us The plan of our Heavenly Father is clear and His promises are great For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be saved John 3 17 Christ came to save us If we have taken a wrong course the Atonement of Jesus Christ can give us the assurance that sin is not a point of no return A safe return is possible if we will follow God s plan for our salvation We have received this plan from the highest authority in the universe even God our Heavenly Father This plan was prepared from before the foundation of the earth It is a great plan of happiness a plan of mercy a plan of redemption a plan of salvation This plan enables us to experience a physical existence including mortality a time of probation and to return to the presence of God and live in eternal happiness and glory It is explained in the doctrines of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Following this plan has beautiful eternal consequences for us individually for our families for generations to come and even for generations who went before The plan includes divine reconciliation and forgiveness How Is Divine Forgiveness Possible We acknowledge that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God Romans 3 23 but we also declare with firmness that repentance and forgiveness can be as real as sin The Atonement of Jesus Christ causes each person to be accountable for his or her individual sins We will overcome the consequences of individual sin by claiming the blessings and benefits of the Atonement President David O McKay said Every principle and ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ is significant and important but there is none more essential to the salvation of the human family than the divine and eternally operative principle of repentance Gospel Ideals 1953 13 For salvation cometh to none except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ Mosiah 3 12 It is not repentance per se that saves man It is the blood of Jesus Christ that saves us It is not by our sincere and honest change of behavior alone that we are saved but by grace that we are saved after all we can do 2 Nephi 25 23 True repentance however is the condition required so that God s forgiveness can come into our lives True repentance makes a brilliant day out of the darkest night Spencer W Kimball The Miracle of Forgiveness 1969 362 What Does True Repentance Consist Of We need a strong faith in Christ to be able to repent Our faith has to include a correct idea of God s character perfections and attributes Lectures on Faith 1985 38 If we believe that God knows all things is loving and is merciful we will be able to put our trust in Him for our salvation without wavering Faith in Christ will change our thoughts beliefs and behaviors that are not in harmony with God s will True repentance brings us back to doing what is right To truly repent we must recognize our sins and feel remorse or godly sorrow and confess those sins to God If our sins are serious we must also confess them to our authorized priesthood leader We need to ask God for forgiveness and do all we can to correct whatever harm our actions may have caused Repentance means a change of mind and heart we stop doing things that are wrong and we start doing things that are right It brings us a fresh attitude toward God oneself and life in general What Are the Fruits of Forgiveness True repentance blesses our lives with the effects of the Atonement we feel God s forgiveness and His peace and our guilt and sorrow are lifted away we enjoy the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance and we are better prepared to live with our Heavenly Father President Spencer W Kimball taught The essence of the miracle of forgiveness is that it brings peace to the previously anxious restless frustrated perhaps tormented soul God will wipe away the tears of anguish and remorse and fear and guilt The Miracle of Forgiveness 363 368 Jesus promised Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid John 14 27 The prophet Alma who was reclaimed from sin to happiness by God s forgiveness declared Wickedness never was happiness Alma 41 10 He had witnessed the bitter pains of sin but he also spoke with excitement about the happiness that accompanies true repentance and forgiveness Yea I say unto you there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy Alma 36 21 Alma concluded with powerful and wise counsel to all who seek forgiveness And now I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more and only let your sins trouble you with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance Alma 42 29 How Can We Know That God Has Forgiven Us President Harold B Lee said When you have done all within your power to overcome your mistakes and have determined in your heart that you will never repeat them again then peace of conscience can come to you by which you will know that your sins have been forgiven in Law of Chastity Vital Girls Told Church News Sept 2 1972 7 Once we have truly repented Christ will take away the burden of guilt for our sins We can know for ourselves that we have been forgiven and made clean The Holy Ghost will verify this to us He is the Sanctifier No other testimony of forgiveness can be greater The Lord said He that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven D C 1 32 emphasis added And He said Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Matthew 11 28 Be faithful and diligent and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love D C 6 20 And He declared Behold he who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and I the Lord remember them no more D C 58 42 Satan will try to make us believe that our sins are not forgiven because we can remember them Satan is a liar he tries to blur our vision and lead us away from the path of repentance and forgiveness God did not promise that we would not remember our sins Remembering will help us avoid making the same mistakes again But if we stay true and faithful the memory of our sins will be softened over time This will be part of the needed healing and sanctification process Alma testified that after he cried out to Jesus for mercy he could still remember his sins but the memory of his sins no longer distressed and tortured him because he knew he had been forgiven see Alma 36 17 19 It is our responsibility to avoid anything that would bring back old sinful memories When we continue to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit 3 Nephi 12 19 we may trust that God will remember our sins no more How Does Extending Forgiveness Help Us to Receive God s Forgiveness Jesus taught us eternal truth when He taught us to pray Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors For if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not neither will your Father forgive your trespasses 3 Nephi 13 11 14 15 Therefore extending forgiveness is a precondition to receiving forgiveness For our own good we need the moral courage to forgive and to ask for forgiveness Never is the soul nobler and more courageous than when we forgive This includes forgiving ourselves Each of us is under a divinely spoken obligation to reach out with pardon and mercy and to forgive one another There is a great need for this Christlike attribute in our families in our marriages in our wards and stakes in our communities and in our nations We will receive the joy of forgiveness in our own lives when we are willing to extend that joy freely to others Lip service is not enough We need to purge our hearts and minds of feelings and thoughts of bitterness and let the light and the love of Christ enter in As a result the Spirit of the Lord will fill our souls with the joy accompanying divine peace of conscience see Mosiah 4 2 3 My dear brothers and sisters my dear young friends when the captain of a long range jet passes the point of safe return and the headwinds are too strong or the cruising altitudes too low he might be forced to divert to an airport other than his planned destination This is not so in our journey through life back to our heavenly home Wherever you find yourselves on this journey through life whatever trials you may face there is always a point of safe return there is always hope You are the captain of your life and God has prepared a plan to bring you safely back to Him to your divine destination The gift of the Atonement of Jesus Christ provides us at all times and at all places with the blessings of repentance and forgiveness Because of this gift the opportunity to make a safe return from the disastrous course of sin is available to all of us For this I give thanks to our Heavenly Father and of this I bear testimony with all my heart and soul in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In the Book of Mormon we read of young Nephi who was commanded by the Lord to build a ship He was quick to obey this commandment but his brothers were skeptical When my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship he wrote they began to murmur against me saying Our brother is a fool for he thinketh that he can build a ship yea and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters 1 Nephi 17 17 But Nephi was not discouraged He had no experience building ships but he had a strong personal testimony that the Lord would prepare a way to accomplish the thing which he commandeth 1 Nephi 3 7 With this powerful testimony and motivation in his heart Nephi built a ship in which they crossed the great waters despite the strong opposition expressed by his faithless brothers Let me share with you a personal experience from my own youth about the power of righteous motives After the turmoil of the Second World War my family ended up in Russian occupied East Germany When I attended fourth grade I had to learn Russian as my first foreign language in school I found this quite difficult because of the Cyrillic alphabet but as time went on I seemed to do all right When I turned 11 we had to leave East Germany overnight because of the political orientation of my father Now I was going to school in West Germany which was American occupied at that time There in school all children were required to learn English and not Russian To learn Russian had been difficult but English was impossible for me I thought my mouth was not made for speaking English My teachers struggled My parents suffered And I knew English was definitely not my language But then something changed in my young life Almost daily I rode my bicycle to the airport and watched airplanes take off and land I read studied and learned everything I could find about aviation It was my greatest desire to become a pilot I could already picture myself in the cockpit of an airliner or in a military fighter plane I felt deep in my heart this was my thing Then I learned that to become a pilot I needed to speak English Overnight to the total surprise of everybody it appeared as if my mouth had changed I was able to learn English It still took a lot of work persistence and patience but I was able to learn English Why Because of a righteous and strong motive Our motives and thoughts ultimately influence our actions The testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the most powerful motivating force in our lives Jesus repeatedly emphasized the power of good thoughts and proper motives Look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not D C 6 36 The testimony of Jesus Christ and the restored gospel will help us in our lives to learn of God s specific plan for us and then to act accordingly It gives us assurance of the reality truth and goodness of God of the teachings and Atonement of Jesus Christ and of the divine calling of latter day prophets Our testimony motivates us to live righteously and righteous living will cause our testimony to grow stronger What Is a Testimony One definition of testimony is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter originating from the Latin word testimonium and the word testis meaning witness Testimony http www reference com browse wiki Testimony Merriam Webster s Collegiate Dictionary 11th ed 2003 testimony 1291 For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints the term testimony is a warm and familiar word in our religious expressions It is tender and sweet It has always a certain sacredness about it When we talk about testimony we refer to feelings of our heart and mind rather than an accumulation of logical sterile facts It is a gift of the Spirit a witness from the Holy Ghost that certain concepts are true A testimony is the sure knowledge or assurance from the Holy Ghost of the truth and divinity of the Lord s work in these latter days A testimony is the abiding living and moving conviction of the truths revealed in the gospel of Jesus Christ Marion G Romney How to Gain a Testimony New Era May 1976 8 emphasis added When we bear testimony we declare the absolute truth of the gospel message In a time when many perceive truth as relative a declaration of absolute truth is not very popular nor does it seem politically correct or opportune Testimonies of things how they really are Jacob 4 13 are bold true and vital because they have eternal consequences for mankind Satan wouldn t mind if we declared the message of our faith and gospel doctrine as negotiable according to circumstances Our firm conviction of gospel truth is an anchor in our lives it is steady and reliable as the North Star A testimony is very personal and may be a little different for each of us because everyone is a unique person However a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ will always include these clear and simple truths God lives He is our loving Father in Heaven and we are His children Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and the Savior of the world Joseph Smith is the prophet of God through whom the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in the latter days The Book of Mormon is the word of God President Gordon B Hinckley his counselors and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are the prophets seers and revelators in our day As we acquire a deeper knowledge of these truths and of the plan of salvation by the power and the gift of the Holy Ghost we can come to know the truth of all things Moroni 10 5 How Do We Get a Testimony We all know that it is easier to talk about a testimony than to acquire one The process to receive one is based on the law of the harvest For whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap Galatians 6 7 No good thing comes without effort and sacrifice If we have to work hard to obtain a testimony it will make us and our testimony even stronger And if we share our testimony it will grow A testimony is a most precious possession because it is not acquired by logic or reason alone it cannot be purchased with earthly possessions and it cannot be given as a present or inherited from our ancestors We cannot depend on the testimonies of other people We need to know for ourselves President Gordon B Hinckley said Every Latter day Saint has the responsibility to know for himself or herself with a certainty beyond doubt that Jesus is the resurrected living Son of the living God Fear Not to Do Good Ensign May 1983 80 The source of this sure knowledge and firm conviction is divine revelation for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy Revelation 19 10 We receive this testimony when the Holy Spirit speaks to the spirit within us We will receive a calm and unwavering certainty that will be the source of our testimony and conviction irrespective of our culture race language or socioeconomic background These promptings of the Spirit rather than human logic alone will be the true foundation upon which our testimony will be built The core of this testimony will always be the faith in and the knowledge of Jesus Christ and His divine mission who in the scriptures says of Himself I am the way the truth and the life John 14 6 So how do we receive a personal testimony rooted in the witness of the Holy Ghost The pattern is outlined in the scriptures First Desire to believe The Book of Mormon encourages us If you will awake and arouse your faculties even to an experiment upon my words and exercise a particle of faith even if you can no more than desire to believe Alma 32 27 Some may say I cannot believe I am not a religious person Just consider God promises us divine help even if we have only a desire to believe but it has to be a true and not a pretended desire Second Search the scriptures Have questions study them out search in the scriptures for answers Again the Book of Mormon has good advice for us If you give place that a seed may be planted in your heart through diligent study of the word of God the good seed will begin to swell within your breasts if you will not resist with unbelief This good seed will enlarge your soul and enlighten your understanding Alma 32 28 Third Do the will of God keep the commandments It is not enough to enter into a scholarly debate if we want to know for ourselves that the kingdom of God has been restored upon the earth Casual study is also not enough We have to get in on the action ourselves and that means learning and then doing God s will We need to come to Christ and follow His teachings The Savior taught My doctrine is not mine but his that sent me If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself John 7 16 17 emphasis added And He said If ye love me keep my commandments John 14 15 Fourth Ponder fast and pray To receive knowledge from the Holy Ghost we must ask Heavenly Father for it We must trust that God loves us and that He will help us to recognize the promptings of the Holy Ghost The Book of Mormon reminds us When you read these things remember how merciful the Lord has been unto the children of men from the creation of Adam even down until the time that you shall receive these things and ponder it in your hearts Ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ if these things are true and if you ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost Moroni 10 3 4 And the prophet Alma said I testify unto you that I do know that these things are true And how do you suppose that I know of their surety Behold I have fasted and prayed that I might know these things of myself And the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit and this is the spirit of revelation Alma 5 45 46 My dear brothers and sisters Alma received his witness by fasting and prayer more than 2 000 years ago and we may have the same sacred experience today What Is a Testimony Good For A testimony provides proper perspective motivation and a solid foundation on which to build a life of purpose and personal growth It is a constant source of confidence a true and faithful companion during good times and bad A testimony provides us with a reason for hope and gladness It helps us cultivate a spirit of optimism and happiness and enables us to rejoice in the beauties of nature A testimony motivates us to choose the right at all times and in all circumstances It motivates us to draw nearer to God allowing Him to draw nearer to us see James 4 8 Our personal testimony is a protective shield and like an iron rod it is guiding us safely through darkness and confusion Nephi s testimony gave him the courage to stand up and be counted as one who obeys the Lord He did not murmur doubt or fear no matter what the circumstances When times got tough he said I will go and do what the Lord has commanded for I know that the Lord shall prepare a way to accomplish it 1 Nephi 3 7 Just as the Lord knew Nephi God knows us and loves us This is our time these are our days We are where the action is Our firm personal testimony will motivate us to change ourselves and then bless the world Of this I testify and leave you my blessing as an Apostle of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brethren it is wonderful and humbling to be with you in this worldwide assembly of priesthood holders I love and admire you I feel honored to be counted as one of you I salute you who have the authority to act in the name of God and to perform ordinances which are a vital source of eternal strength and energy for the well being of mankind I will speak today to you wonderful young men who are preparing to make a difference in the world you who have entered the ranks of the Aaronic Priesthood and you who have already received the sacred oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood The priesthood you bear is a wonderful force for good You live in a time of great challenges and opportunities As spirit sons of heavenly parents you are free to make the right choices This requires hard work self discipline and an optimistic outlook which will bring joy and freedom into your life now and in the future The Lord said to Abraham My name is Jehovah and I know the end from the beginning therefore my hand shall be over thee Abr 2 8 My young friends today I say to you that if you trust the Lord and obey Him His hand shall be over you He will help you achieve the great potential He sees in you and He will help you to see the end from the beginning Allow me to share with you an experience from my own boyhood When I was 11 years old my family had to leave East Germany and begin a new life in West Germany overnight Until my father could get back into his original profession as a government employee my parents operated a small laundry business in our little town I became the laundry delivery boy To be able to do that effectively I needed a bicycle to pull the heavy laundry cart I had always dreamed of owning a nice sleek shiny sporty red bicycle But there had never been enough money to fulfill this dream What I got instead was a heavy ugly black sturdy workhorse of a bicycle I delivered laundry on that bike before and after school for quite a few years Most of the time I was not overly excited about the bike the cart or my job Sometimes the cart seemed so heavy and the work so tiring that I thought my lungs would burst and I often had to stop to catch my breath Nevertheless I did my part because I knew we desperately needed the income as a family and it was my way to contribute If I had only known back then what I learned many years later if I had only been able to see the end from the beginning I would have had a better appreciation of these experiences and it would have made my job so much easier Many years later when I was about to be drafted into the military I decided to volunteer instead and join the Air Force to become a pilot I loved flying and thought being a pilot would be my thing To be accepted for the program I had to pass a number of tests including a strict physical exam The doctors were slightly concerned by the results and did some additional medical tests Then they announced You have scars on your lung which are an indication of a lung disease in your early teenage years but obviously you are fine now The doctors wondered what kind of treatment I had gone through to heal the disease Until the day of that examination I had never known that I had any kind of lung disease Then it became clear to me that my regular exercise in fresh air as a laundry boy had been a key factor in my healing from this illness Without the extra effort of pedaling that heavy bicycle day in and day out pulling the laundry cart up and down the streets of our town I might never have become a jet fighter pilot and later a 747 airline captain We don t always know the details of our future We do not know what lies ahead We live in a time of uncertainty We are surrounded by challenges on all sides Occasionally discouragement may sneak into our day frustration may invite itself into our thinking doubt might enter about the value of our work In these dark moments Satan whispers in our ears that we will never be able to succeed that the price isn t worth the effort and that our small part will never make a difference He the father of all lies will try to prevent us from seeing the end from the beginning Fortunately you young priesthood holders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints are taught by prophets seers and revelators of our day The First Presidency said We have great confidence in you You are choice spirits You are at the beginning of your journey through this mortal life Your Heavenly Father wants your life to be joyful and to lead you back into His presence The decisions you make now will determine much of what will follow during your life and throughout eternity For the Strength of Youth 2001 2 You have a responsibility to learn what Heavenly Father wants you to do and then to do your best to follow His will Aaronic Priesthood Fulfilling Our Duty to God 2001 4 How deeply grateful I am for the inspired leadership of our dear President Gordon B Hinckley the prophet of God in our time and his noble counselors Their prophetic view helps you to see the end from the beginning The Lord loves you that is why He has given you commandments and the words of prophets to guide you on your journey through life Some of the most important guidelines for your life are found in the pamphlet For the Strength of Youth The physical appearance of this little paper booklet would qualify it for the scriptural description Out of small things proceedeth that which is great D C 64 33 The pamphlet itself has little material value perhaps just a few cents But the doctrine and principles it presents are an invaluable treasure You young men who are already 18 or older if you don t have this booklet anymore make sure to get one keep it and use it This little booklet is a gem for any age group It contains standards which are sacred symbols representing our membership in the Church I call your attention to the fact that For the Strength of Youth the accompanying Guidebook for Parents and Leaders of Youth and the temple recommend of the Church all have a picture of the Salt Lake Temple imprinted on the front The temple is the binding link between generations in this life and for eternity All the temples have been dedicated for the same purpose to assist in accomplishing the divine work and glory of God our Eternal Father to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 These temples are sacred structures in which eternal questions are answered truths are taught and ordinances performed so that we can live with an understanding of our divine inheritance as children of God and with an awareness of our potential as eternal beings The house of the Lord helps you to see the end from the beginning Just as the temples of God are sacred so are your temporal bodies The Apostle Paul said Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own For ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God s 1 Cor 6 19 20 My dear fellow priesthood holders of all ages and in all places around this world let us use our thoughts our minds and hearts and our bodies with the respect and dignity worthy of a sacred temple given to us by our Heavenly Father The prophets of our day have promised you my friends that as you keep the standards given in For the Strength of Youth and live by the truths in the scriptures you will be able to do your life s work with greater wisdom and skill and bear trials with greater courage You will have the help of the Holy Ghost You will be worthy to go to the temple to receive holy ordinances These blessings and many more can be yours For the Strength of Youth 2 3 We know that God keeps His promises We need to fulfill our part to receive His blessings The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that when we obtain any blessing from God it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated D C 130 21 Every member who wants to go to the temple regardless of age needs to prepare for this sacred experience Certain questions will be asked by your bishop and stake president who hold keys of priesthood authority and are common judges in the Church These vital questions will include Are you honest Are you morally clean Do you keep the Word of Wisdom Do you obey the law of tithing And do you sustain the authorities of the Church The answers to these key questions reflect your attitudes and actions You younger men might not be aware that the standards set by the Lord in the temple recommend questions are very similar to the standards found in For the Strength of Youth In times of calmness but also in times of greatest temptation these standards and the guidance of the Holy Ghost will help you make the right choices about your education friends dress and appearance entertainment media and the Internet your language proper dating sexual purity honesty Sabbath day observance and service to others How you apply these standards will say much about who you are and what you seek to become The Lord wants you my young friends to desire with all your heart to keep these standards and live by the gospel truths found in the scriptures As you do this you will see beyond the moment and you will see your bright and wonderful future with great opportunities and responsibilities You will be willing to work hard and endure long and you will have an optimistic outlook on life You will see that your life s road will lead you to the house of the Lord first and then to serve a full time mission representing the Savior wherever He will send you After your mission you will organize and plan your life based on the same standards Therefore in your mind s eye you will see yourself entering the house of the Lord for an eternal marriage and family Your priorities in life will change to match the priorities given to us by the Savior And God will bless you and open the eyes of your understanding so you can see the end from the beginning Living the standards set in For the Strength of Youth will make you feel good about yourself Write those standards into your heart and mind and live accordingly Compare each of those standards with where you are today Listen to the Spirit who will teach you what you need to do to become more like Jesus If you recognize a need for change make the change don t procrastinate Use true repentance and the gift and power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to clear up those things that are keeping you from reaching your true potential If this process appears tough hang in there it is worth it The Lord has a promise for you as He had for the Prophet Joseph Know thou my son that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good D C 122 7 Now my dear grandfathers fathers uncles brothers and friends of our young people we can be of great help in this process King Benjamin taught that when parents are truly converted they will teach their children to walk in the ways of truth and soberness and will teach them to love one another and to serve one another Mosiah 4 15 It has been said Teaching by example is one way to teach I would say Teaching by example is the best way to teach Please teach our young people by your example of being a temple worthy priesthood holder Your good life your love for God and fellow men your applied testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ will be a convincing power to our youth and it will help them to see the end from the beginning My dear young friends please perfect your lives in living these standards given by the prophets of our day As you do this step by step day after day you will honor the priesthood and you will be prepared to make a difference in the world You will also be on the right track to return with honor to our Heavenly Father My dear fellow servants of the priesthood I promise you today that when you follow this pattern the Lord will help you to make more out of your life than you ever can by yourself He will help you always to see the end from the beginning Of this I testify as an Apostle of the Lord our Savior and in the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters my dear friends During my professional life as an airline pilot I sometimes had passengers visit the cockpit of my Boeing 747 They asked about the many switches instruments systems and procedures and how all this technical equipment would help such a huge and beautiful airplane fly As with all pilots I enjoyed the fact that they were impressed by the apparent complexity of this plane and that they wondered what kind of magnificent and brilliant person it takes to operate it At this point of my story my wife and children would kindly interrupt and say with a twinkling in their eyes Pilots are born with a great measure of natural humility To the visitors in my cockpit I would explain that it takes a great aerodynamic design many auxiliary systems and programs and powerful engines to make this flying machine equal to the task of bringing comfort and safety to those joining the flight To simplify my explanation by focusing on the basics I would add that all you really need is a strong forward thrust a powerful upward lift and the right aircraft attitude and the laws of nature will carry the 747 and its passengers safely across continents and oceans over high mountains and dangerous thunderstorms to its destination In recent years I have often contemplated that being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints invites us to ask similar questions What are the basics the fundamental principles of our membership in the kingdom of God on earth After all is said and done what will really carry us at times of greatest need to our desired eternal destination The Church with all its organizational structure and programs offers many important activities for its members aimed at helping families and individuals to serve God and each other Sometimes however it can appear that these programs and activities are closer to the center of our heart and soul than the core doctrines and principles of the gospel Procedures programs policies and patterns of organization are helpful for our spiritual progress here on earth but let s not forget that they are subject to change In contrast the core of the gospel the doctrine and the principles will never change Living according to the basic gospel principles will bring power strength and spiritual self reliance into the lives of all Latter day Saints Faith is such a principle of power We need this source of power in our lives God works by power but this power is usually exercised in response to our faith Faith without works is dead James 2 20 God works according to the faith of His children The Prophet Joseph Smith explained I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves quoted by John Taylor in The Organization of the Church Millennial Star Nov 15 1851 339 To me this teaching is beautifully straightforward As we strive to understand internalize and live correct gospel principles we will become more spiritually self reliant The principle of spiritual self reliance grows out of a fundamental doctrine of the Church that God has granted us agency I believe that moral agency is one of the greatest gifts of God unto His children next to life itself When I study and ponder moral agency and its eternal consequences I realize that we are truly spirit children of God and therefore should act accordingly This understanding also reminds me that as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints we are part of a great worldwide family of Saints The organizational structure of the Church allows great flexibility according to the size growth pattern and needs of our congregations There is the basic unit program with a very simple organizational structure and fewer meetings We also have large wards with great organizational resources to serve one another All are established within the inspired programs of the Church to help members come unto Christ and be perfected in him Moro 10 32 All these varied options are equal in divine value because the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the same in each unit I testify as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ that He lives that the gospel is true and that it offers the answers to all personal and collective challenges the children of God have on this earth today This summer my wife and I visited with members of the Church in many countries throughout Europe In some parts of Europe the Church has been present for many years even since 1837 There is a great heritage of faithful members in Europe Currently we have more than 400 000 members in Europe As we look at all the generations who have emigrated from Europe to America during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that total number could easily be multiplied a few times Why did so many faithful members leave their home countries in those early days of the Church Many reasons can be named to escape persecution to help build the Church in America to improve their economic circumstances the desire to be close to a temple and many more Europe still feels the consequence of this exodus But the strength that comes from several faithful generations of Church members is now becoming more apparent We see more young men and women and more senior couples serve missions for the Lord we see more temple marriages we see more confidence and courage by the members to share the restored gospel Among the peoples of Europe and many other parts of the world there is a spiritual vacuum of Christ s true teachings This vacuum must can and will be filled with the message of the restored gospel as our wonderful members live and proclaim this gospel with greater courage and faith With the expansion of the Church in Europe there are now countries where the Church has been for less than 15 years I spoke with a mission president serving in his homeland of Russia who has been a member for only seven years He told me The same month I was baptized I was called as a branch president Did he feel overwhelmed at times Absolutely Did he try to implement the full range of Church programs Fortunately not How did he grow so strong in such a small congregation in such a short time He explained I knew with all my soul the Church was true The doctrine of the gospel filled my mind and my heart As we joined the Church we felt part of a family We felt warmth trust and love We were only few but we all tried to follow the Savior They supported each other they did the best they could and they knew the Church was true It was not the organization that had attracted him but the light of the gospel and this light strengthened those good members In many countries the Church is still in its beginnings and the organizational circumstances are sometimes far from perfect However the members may have a perfect testimony of the truth in their hearts As the members will stay in their countries and build the Church despite economic challenges and hardships future generations will be grateful to those courageous modern day pioneers They abide by the loving invitation of the First Presidency given in 1999 In our day the Lord has seen fit to provide the blessings of the gospel including an increased number of temples in many parts of the world Therefore we wish to reiterate the long standing counsel to members of the Church to remain in their homelands rather than immigrate to the United States As members throughout the world remain in their homelands working to build the Church in their native countries great blessings will come to them personally and to the Church collectively First Presidency letter Dec 1 1999 May I add a word of caution to those of us who live in large wards and stakes We have to be careful that the center of our testimony is not located in the social dimension of the Church community or the wonderful activities programs and organizations of our wards and stakes All of these things are important and valuable to have but they are not enough Even friendship is not enough We recognize that we are living in a time of turmoil disaster and war We and many others feel strongly the great need for a defense and for a refuge from the storm and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth D C 115 6 How do we find such a place of safety The prophet of God even President Hinckley has taught Our safety lies in the virtue of our lives Our strength lies in our righteousness Till We Meet Again Liahona Jan 2002 105 Ensign Nov 2001 90 Recall with me how Jesus Christ instructed His Apostles clearly and directly at the beginning of His mortal ministry Come follow me and I will make you fishers of men Matt 4 19 This was also the beginning of the ministry of the Twelve Apostles and I suspect that they had a feeling of inadequacy as I deeply have being one who has also been called to this sacred work May I suggest that the Savior Himself teaches us here a lesson about core doctrine and priorities in life Individually we need to first follow Him and as we do this the Savior will bless us beyond our own capacity to become what He wants us to be To follow Christ is to become more like Him It is to learn from His character As spirit children of our Heavenly Father we do have the potential to incorporate Christlike attributes into our life and character The Savior invites us to learn His gospel by living His teachings To follow Him is to apply correct principles and then witness for ourselves the blessings that follow This process is very complex and very simple at the same time Ancient and modern prophets described it with three words Keep the commandments nothing more nothing less Developing Christlike attributes in our lives is not an easy task especially when we move away from generalities and abstractions and begin to deal with real life The test comes in practicing what we proclaim The reality check comes when Christlike attributes need to become visible in our lives as husband or wife as father or mother as son or daughter in our friendships in our employment in our business and in our recreation We can recognize our growth as can those around us as we gradually increase our capacity to act in all holiness before Him D C 43 9 The scriptures describe a number of Christlike attributes we need to develop during the course of our lives They include knowledge and humility charity and love obedience and diligence faith and hope These personal character qualities stand independent of the organizational status of our Church unit our economic circumstances our family situation culture race or language Christlike attributes are gifts from God They cannot be developed without His help The one help we all need is given to us freely through the Atonement of Jesus Christ Having faith in Jesus Christ and in His Atonement means relying completely on Him trusting in His infinite power intelligence and love Christlike attributes come into our lives as we exercise our agency righteously Faith in Jesus Christ leads to action When we have faith in Christ we trust the Lord enough to follow His commandments even when we do not completely understand the reasons for them In seeking to become more like the Savior we need to reevaluate our lives regularly and rely through the path of true repentance upon the merits of Jesus Christ and the blessings of His Atonement Developing Christlike attributes can be a painful process We need to be ready to accept direction and correction from the Lord and His servants This worldwide conference with its music and spoken word offers spiritual power direction and blessings from on high D C 43 16 It is a time when the voice of personal inspiration and revelation will bring peace to our souls and will teach us how to become more Christlike This voice will be as sweet as the voice of a dear friend and it will fill our souls when our hearts are sufficiently contrite By becoming more like the Savior we will grow in our ability to abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost Rom 15 13 We will lay aside the things of this world and seek for the things of a better D C 25 10 This leads me back to my aerodynamic analogy from the beginning I spoke of focusing on the basics Christlike attributes are the basics They are the fundamental principles that will create the wind beneath our wings As we develop Christlike attributes in our own lives step by step they will bear us up as on eagles wings D C 124 18 Our faith in Jesus Christ will provide power and a strong forward thrust our unwavering and active hope will provide a powerful upward lift Both faith and hope will carry us across oceans of temptations over mountains of afflictions and bring us safely back to our eternal home and destination Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Only six months ago you faithful members of the Church of Jesus Christ sustained me as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles This calling came as a great surprise to many but especially to our grandchildren who said But he is our Opa He is just a regular person He played with us and he used to cut our hair After the October general conference my wife and I talked to our children on the telephone and one of our grandsons said Since we were so far away from you and could not be with you in Salt Lake City at least you should have waved to us when you were giving your conference talk We have not yet been with our children and grandchildren until this general conference and so I wave today hoping to make a grandson happy I also wave to all of you wonderful members whose prayers and love are so important and appreciated by my wife and me In my growing up years in Germany I attended church in many different locations and circumstances in humble back rooms in impressive villas and in very functional modern chapels All of these buildings had one important factor in common the Spirit of God was present the love of the Savior could be felt as we assembled as a branch or ward family The Zwickau chapel had an old air driven organ Every Sunday a young man was assigned to push up and down the sturdy lever operating the bellows to make the organ work Even before I was an Aaronic Priesthood bearer I sometimes had the great privilege to assist in this important task While the congregation sang our beloved hymns of the Restoration I pumped with all my strength so the organ would not run out of wind The eyes of the organist unmistakably indicated whether I was doing fine or needed to increase my efforts quickly I always felt honored by the importance of this duty and the trust that the organist had placed in me It was a wonderful feeling of accomplishment to have a responsibility and to be part of this great work There was an additional benefit that came from this assignment the bellows operator sat in a seat that offered a great view of a stained glass window that beautified the front part of the chapel The stained glass portrayed the First Vision with Joseph Smith kneeling in the Sacred Grove looking up toward heaven and into a pillar of light During the hymns of the congregation and even during talks and testimonies given by our members I often looked at this depiction of a most sacred moment in world history In my mind s eye I saw Joseph receiving knowledge witness and divine instructions as he became a blessed instrument in the hand of our Heavenly Father I felt a special spirit while looking at the beautiful scene in this window picture of a believing young boy in a sacred grove who made a courageous decision to earnestly pray to our Heavenly Father who listened and responded lovingly to him Here I was a young boy in post World War II Germany living in a city in ruins thousands of miles away from Palmyra in North America and more than a hundred years after the event actually took place By the universal power of the Holy Ghost I felt in my heart and in my mind that it was true that Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus Christ and heard Their voices The Spirit of God comforted my soul at this young age with an assurance of the reality of this sacred moment that resulted in the beginning of a worldwide movement destined to roll forth until it has filled the whole earth D C 65 2 I believed Joseph Smith s testimony of that glorious experience in the Sacred Grove then and I know it now God has spoken to mankind again Looking back I am grateful for so many friends who helped me in my youth to gain a testimony of the restored Church of Jesus Christ First I exercised simple faith in their testimonies and then I received the divine witness of the Spirit to my mind and to my heart I count Joseph Smith among those whose testimony of Christ helped me to develop my own testimony of the Savior Before I recognized the tutoring of the Spirit testifying to me that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God my youthful heart felt that he was a friend of God and would therefore quite naturally also be a friend of mine I knew I could trust Joseph Smith The scriptures teach us that spiritual gifts are given to those who ask of God who love Him and who keep His commandments see D C 46 9 All have not every gift given unto them for there are many gifts and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God To some is given one and to some is given another that all may be profited thereby D C 46 11 12 Today I know that my young testimony benefited greatly from the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and many friends in the Church who knew by the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that he was crucified for the sins of the world D C 46 13 Their good examples caring love and helping hands blessed me to receive another special gift of the Spirit described in the scriptures as I was yearning for more light and truth To others it is given to believe on their words that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithfully D C 46 14 What a wonderful and precious gift this is As we truly humble ourselves we will be blessed with this gift to have faith and to hope for things which are not seen but are true see Alma 32 21 As we experiment upon the words given to us by the scriptures and the living prophets even if we only have a desire to believe and do not resist the Spirit of the Lord our souls will be enlarged and our understanding will be enlightened see Alma 32 26 28 The Savior Himself explained this merciful principle clearly to all the world in His great intercessory prayer given not only for His Apostles but for all the Saints even for us today wherever we might be living He said Neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word That they all may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me John 17 20 21 emphasis added This is how Joseph Smith s First Vision blesses our own personal lives the lives of families and eventually the whole human family we come to believe in Jesus Christ through the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith Prophets and apostles throughout the history of mankind have had divine manifestations similar to Joseph s Moses saw God face to face and learned that he was a son of God in the similitude of His Only Begotten see Moses 1 1 6 The Apostle Paul testified that the resurrected Jesus Christ appeared to him on the road to Damascus and made Paul one of His great missionaries see Acts 26 9 23 Hearing Paul s witness of his heavenly vision during the trial at Caesarea the powerful King Agrippa admitted Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian Acts 26 28 And there were many other ancient prophets who also bore powerful testimony of Christ All of these manifestations ancient and modern lead those who believe to the divine source of all righteousness and hope to God our Heavenly Father and to His Son Jesus Christ God has spoken to Joseph Smith for the purpose of blessing all of God s children with His mercy and love even in times of uncertainties and insecurities of wars and rumors of wars of natural and personal disasters The Savior said Behold mine arm of mercy is extended towards you and whosoever will come him will I receive 3 Ne 9 14 And all who accept this invitation will be encircled about with the matchless bounty of his love Alma 26 15 Through our faith in the personal witness of the Prophet Joseph and the reality of the First Vision through study and prayer deep and sincere we will be blessed with a firm faith in the Savior of the world who spoke to Joseph on the morning of a beautiful clear day early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty JS H 1 14 Faith in Jesus Christ and a testimony of Him and His universal Atonement is not just a doctrine with great theological value Such faith is a universal gift glorious for all cultural regions of this earth irrespective of language race color nationality or socioeconomic circumstance The powers of reason may be used to try to understand this gift but those who feel its effects most deeply are those who are willing to accept its blessings which come from a pure and clean life of following the path of true repentance and living the commandments of God As we remember and honor the Prophet Joseph Smith my heart reaches out to him in gratitude He was a good honest humble intelligent and courageous young man with a heart of gold and an unshaken faith in God He had integrity In response to his humble prayer the heavens opened again Joseph Smith had actually seen a vision He knew it and he knew that God knew it and he could not deny it See JS H 1 25 Through his work and sacrifice I now have a true understanding of our Heavenly Father and His Son our Redeemer and Savior Jesus Christ and I can feel the power of the Holy Ghost and know of Heavenly Father s plan for us His children For me these are truly the fruits of the First Vision I am grateful that early in my life I was blessed with a simple faith that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God that he saw God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ in a vision He translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God That testimony has been confirmed to me over and over again As one of the least among you but in my calling as one of the Apostles of Jesus Christ I testify that He truly lives that He is the Messiah I do have a personal witness of Jesus Christ the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind I received this knowledge by the unspeakable peace and power of the Spirit of God The desire of my heart and of my mind is to be pure and faithful in serving Him now and forever I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters here in Salt Lake City and around the world it is good to be with you I extend my love and my greetings to Elder Bednar and Elder Robert Oaks in their new callings To describe my inner feelings I would say I am calm as a hurricane or even better I am happy and frightened In one sentence I need your prayers I need the Lord Having received a call and been given a sacred trust that will completely influence my life forever my feelings are tender and my emotions often close to tears I have a great sense of inadequacy and I have felt a sweet agony from a deep and often painful examination of my soul during the many hours which have passed day and night since Friday morning this week After President Gordon B Hinckley extended the call to me to become an Apostle and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve I left my busy office to share this totally unexpected news with my beloved Harriet At this most important time in our lives we have cherished the quiet sacredness of our home as a place of refuge and of defense How grateful I am for my wife for the loving comfort and strong support she has been throughout my life Next to the gift of life itself and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ Harriet is the greatest blessing which has come into my life I wish to express my deep love and appreciation to our children and our grandchildren for their prayers and love but most of all for their example Our children and grandchildren live in Germany and are building the kingdom of God in our homeland The joys of the gospel of Jesus Christ and its eternal blessings bridge over the distance of many thousands of miles and bring happiness and comfort into our lives I express my gratitude and love to each member of our family and to a large number of friends and teachers along the way who teach and serve and lift to make us who we are I express my deepest feelings of love and gratitude to the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve for their love and kindness In the closing of my stewardship as one of the seven Presidents of the Seventy I want to express my love and admiration to the Seventy They are truly especial witnesses of Christ Instead of any others they are the men the Twelve call upon when they need assistance I give thanks to those dedicated men who are giving so much of their time talents and spiritual power to build the kingdom Words cannot describe how I love the 10 1 2 years I had the privilege and joy to serve as a Seventy I will cherish the example and friendship of the members of the Quorums of the Seventy forever I want to thank each and every member of the Church throughout the world for your faithfulness despite temptations for your love for your dedication to the principles and doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ for your willingness to follow the living prophet in making the wards and branches grow for your sacrifices in giving of your time and energy and your emotional spiritual and temporal substance Thank you for paying an honest tithing and not neglecting the poor and the lonely I have seen the face of Christ in your faces in your deeds and in your exemplary lives You are a modern miracle I thank you for sustaining with your hand and with your heart the general officers of the Church Yesterday we sustained the general leadership of the Church according to the principle of common consent Not one of these Church leaders is seeking such a position nor are they declining such a call because they know it comes by revelation from God We are grateful for your prayers and we pray for you We love you and we need your love We sustain you and we need your willingness to serve the Lord wherever you are and to whatever position you are called In the Lord s Church every calling is important President Gordon B Hinckley said We are here to assist our Father in His work and His glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man Moses 1 39 Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility as is my obligation in my sphere This Is the Work of the Master Ensign May 1995 71 And the President asked us to reach out to others and bless the lives of those around us He said Let there be cultivated an awareness in every member s heart of his own potential for bringing others to a knowledge of the truth Let him pray with great earnestness about it Find the Lambs Feed the Sheep Liahona July 1999 120 Ensign May 1999 106 My life was eternally blessed by one choice member who reached out more than 50 years ago Some days after World War II my grandmother was standing in line for food when an elderly single sister with no family of her own invited her to sacrament meeting in Zwickau East Germany My grandmother and my parents accepted the invitation They went to church felt the Spirit were uplifted by the kindness of the members and were edified by the hymns of the Restoration My grandmother my parents and my three siblings were all baptized I had to wait two years because I was only six How grateful I am for a spiritually sensitive grandmother teachable parents and a wise white haired elderly single sister who had the sweet boldness to reach out and follow the Savior s example by inviting us to come and see see John 1 39 Her name was Sister Ewig which translates in English to Sister Eternal I will be eternally grateful for her love and example With these tender feelings of gratitude for all who have influenced my life in past years I commit myself to the future My heart and mind are filled with joy that for the rest of my life I will have the opportunity to talk of Christ rejoice in Christ preach of Christ and prophesy of Christ 2 Ne 25 26 all this as a special witness of our Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ see D C 107 23 Realizing my weaknesses I gain great comfort from the instructions given by the Lord In the Doctrine and Covenants we read The fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world and before kings and rulers And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong and blessed from on high and receive knowledge D C 1 23 26 28 And in the Book of Mormon we read I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them 1 Ne 3 7 And in the Old Testament we receive comfort The Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt be turned into another man God gave him another heart and God is with thee 1 Sam 10 6 9 7 I trust these wonderful promises I therefore pledge to you to these my Brethren and to the Lord that I will live to be worthy to know the will of the Lord and to act accordingly God our Heavenly Father knows us by name Jesus Christ lives He is the Messiah He loves us The Atonement of Jesus Christ is real it brings immortality to all and opens the door to eternal life The gospel of Jesus Christ is again on the earth The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is true and living The Book of Mormon is a second witness of Jesus Christ and a manifestation of the truthfulness of the Prophet Joseph Smith I love the Prophet Joseph I love President Gordon B Hinckley who is the prophet of God and holds all the keys of the kingdom at this time keys which prophets have held in uninterrupted succession since Joseph Smith These things I know in my heart and in my mind And of these things I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
What a joy and privilege it is to be part of this worldwide Church and be taught and uplifted by prophets seers and revelators This conference is being broadcast to 68 countries and translated into 55 languages This is truly a global Church with members spread across the nations of the earth We are all children of a living and loving God our Heavenly Father I express my love to you my dear brothers and sisters Just three months ago we joined under the inspired leadership of President Gordon B Hinckley in the dedication of the rebuilt Nauvoo Temple It brought us back to the Prophet Joseph and renewed our memories of the early Saints their sacrifices sorrows and tears but also their courage faith and trust in the Lord I have no ancestors among the 19th century pioneers However since the first days of my Church membership I have felt a close kinship to those early pioneers who crossed the plains They are my spiritual ancestry as they are for each and every member of the Church regardless of nationality language or culture They have established not only a safe place in the West but also a spiritual foundation for the building of the kingdom of God in all the nations of the world As the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is now being embraced around the world we are all pioneers in our own sphere and circumstance It was in the turmoil of post World War II Germany when my family first learned about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints George Albert Smith was the President then I was only a young child and we had lost all material belongings twice within only seven years We were refugees with an uncertain future However during those same seven years we gained more than any amount of money could ever buy We found a supernal refuge a place of defense from despair the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church led by a true and living prophet During this time of my childhood I played in bombed out houses and grew up with the ever present consequences of a lost war and the awareness that my own country had inflicted terrible pain on many nations during the horrific World War II The good news that Jesus Christ has made the perfect Atonement for mankind redeeming all from the grave and rewarding each individual according to his or her works was the healing power which brought hope and peace back into my life Whatever our challenges in life may be our burdens may become light if we not only believe in Christ but also in His ability and His power to cleanse and console our lives and accept His peace President David O McKay was the prophet during my teenage years I seemed to know him personally I could feel his love kindness and dignity he gave me confidence and courage in my young life Even though I grew up thousands of miles away in Europe I felt he trusted me and I did not want to disappoint him Another source of strength was a letter written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison addressed to Timothy his most trusted assistant and friend He wrote For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord 2 Tim 1 7 8 These words from one of the ancient Apostles of our Savior rang with great importance for me in postwar times even as they do today Yet how many of us permit our fears to take control in this time of international tension economical and political uncertainties and personal challenges God is speaking to us in a consistent voice God will deal with all the human family equally We might be in a large ward or a small branch our climate or vegetation may differ the cultural background and language might vary and the color of our skin could be totally different But the universal power and blessings of the restored gospel are available to all irrespective of culture nationality political system tradition language economic environment or education Today we have again apostles seers and revelators who are watchmen on the tower messengers of supernal healing truth God speaks to us through them They are profoundly aware of the different circumstances we members are living in They are in this world but not of this world We have a living prophet on the face of the earth even President Gordon B Hinckley He knows our challenges and fears He has inspired answers A year ago he taught us in his optimistic and clear way He said There is no need to fear We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our homes We can be an influence for good in this world every one of us Our safety lies in repentance Our strength comes of obedience to the commandments of God The Times in Which We Live Ensign Nov 2001 74 Liahona Jan 2002 86 The prophets speak to us in the name of the Lord and in plainness As the Book of Mormon confirms For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding for he speaketh unto men according to their language unto their understanding 2 Ne 31 3 It is our responsibility not only to listen but also to act upon His word that we may claim the blessings of the ordinances and covenants of the restored gospel He said I the Lord am bound when ye do what I say but when ye do not what I say ye have no promise D C 82 10 There may be times when we may feel overwhelmed hurt or on the edge of discouragement as we are trying so hard to be perfect members of the Church Be assured there is balm in Gilead Let us listen to the prophets of our days as they help us to focus on the things that are central to the Creator s plan for the eternal destiny of His children The Lord knows us He loves us He wants us to succeed and He encourages us by saying And see that all things are done in wisdom and order for it is not requisite that men or women should run faster than they have strength But it is expedient that they should be diligent Mosiah 4 27 Are we diligent in living the commandments of God without running beyond our strength Or are we just leisurely strolling along Are we using our time talents and means wisely Are we focused on the things which matter most Are we following the inspired counsel of the prophets One example of great importance for humanity is strengthening our own families The principle of family home evening was given to us in 1915 President McKay reminded parents again in 1964 that no other success can compensate for failure in the home quoted from J E McCulloch Home The Savior of Civilization 1924 42 in Conference Report Apr 1964 5 In 1995 the prophets of our day called upon all the world to strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society And only three years ago the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles lovingly stated We counsel parents and children to give highest priority to family prayer family home evening gospel study and instruction and wholesome family activities However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be they must not be permitted to displace the divinely appointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform News of the Church Ensign June 1999 80 Letter from the First Presidency Liahona Dec 1999 1 Let us in humility and faith refresh our dedication and our commitment to follow the prophets seers and revelators in all diligence Let us listen and be instructed and edified by those who hold all the keys of the kingdom And as we attend this conference may our hearts be changed that there will be a great desire to do good see Alma 19 33 and that we will be pioneers in building a spiritual foundation that will establish the Church in our part of the world In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brethren it is wonderful and humbling to be with you tonight in this vast assembly of priesthood holders I am especially grateful for the solemn experience we had this morning in which I learned again how the Lord is directing and guiding His church in these latter days A few days ago my profession as a B 747 captain took me home on a flight from Dallas Texas to Frankfurt Germany It was a moonless night over the North Atlantic and myriads of stars covered the sky As I contemplated this awesome sight from the cockpit my thoughts went to the many miracles I have seen in my life Forty five years ago shortly after the horrors of the Second World War at age eight I was baptized in Zwickau Sachsen in eastern Germany This came about because a white haired courageous and caring lady shared the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with my grandmother and parents and they did not hesitate to accept the challenge How I love them for that In 1952 my family had to leave that part of my homeland expecting never to see it again We went to Frankfurt where I was ordained a deacon and taught by tough but loving leaders to appreciate the value of work and service At the same time in the heart of western Germany another marvelous lady recently widowed still in her thirties was terrified by the difficulties of the future She had two young daughters and felt left alone in a country without hope Right then two young missionaries rang the doorbell and brought the message of light truth and hope I give thanks eternally to those diligent American missionaries and most of all to Sister Carmen Reich who became my mother in law for her faith strength and willingness to listen to the still small voice My life has been very different because of the miraculous insight of these great individuals In those years many Saints left Europe to go to Zion But then the Brethren taught us that Zion could be anywhere around the globe if we were willing to establish it The Saints had faith and stayed and Zion increased in beauty and holiness Stakes were organized and strengthened Nevertheless Germany still had two completely different political systems divided by concrete walled boundaries My eternal partner my wife Harriet encouraged me never to lose hope that someday there would be one Germany again How grateful I am for her her love and partnership and for our family In 1976 President Monson gave my country a blessing with promises far beyond logical or political reasoning It was a prophetic promise which required modern day miracles And the miracles occurred In 1989 the Berlin Wall fell and this week four years ago Germany was reunited The borders were enlarged and Zion was enabled to put on her beautiful garments there are now two temples in Germany five temples in Europe and more to come The kingdom of God is expanding rapidly into the eastern parts of Europe and even moving far beyond geographic or political boundaries of yesterday Missionaries are now serving at places most of us have to look up in dictionaries or cannot find easily on maps I am grateful for the Saints in Europe for their strong testimonies which are visible in the conduct of their everyday lives Their faith has given me comfort and security Their examples have helped me to find and keep the right direction in days of challenge and questioning That dark night over the North Atlantic safely directing our big jet to its destination we had to be extremely careful and precise in creating the navigation basis by entering the geographic coordinates into the navigation reference system It had to be true and valid because it was the foundation for all future decisions In 1979 a flight started in New Zealand on wrong coordinates and crashed into Mount Erebus at the South Pole The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only true and valid basis for our lives If we enter it into our system into all our heart might mind and strength D C 4 2 we will know how to choose the right and to whom to listen On long range flights the shortwave radio frequencies are often crowded and static distorts the messages The same is true for our lives Everybody wants to get their message across We have to train and condition ourselves to hear the still small voice never to be distracted or stop listening because of too much static on that sacred frequency This can best be done by internalizing and acting according to the moral and ethical standards we receive from the scriptures and the living prophets From the Prophet Joseph Smith to President Howard W Hunter we are receiving updated sacred guidance according to our needs and readiness The general conference messages by our prophets seers and revelators are given to us by the Lord in his own time in his own way and for a very special purpose Jesus Christ the Son of God made the miracle of forgiveness and redemption possible This is truly the Church of Jesus Christ it proclaims a gospel of joy hope courage truth love and miracles This I bear humble witness of in the name of Jesus Christ amen
