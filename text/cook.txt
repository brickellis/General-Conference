Today I will speak on continuing revelation to prophets and continuing personal revelation to guide our lives Sometimes we receive revelation even when we do not know the Lord s purposes Shortly before Elder Jeffrey R Holland was called to be an Apostle in June of 1994 I had a beautiful revelatory experience that he would be called I was a regional representative and could see no reason I would be given that knowledge But we were companions as young missionaries in England in the early 1960s and I had a great love for him I considered the experience a tender mercy for me In recent years I have wondered if the Lord was preparing me to be junior in the Twelve to an incredible missionary companion who was my junior companion when we were young missionaries 1 I sometimes warn young missionaries to be kind to their junior companions because they never know when they might be their senior companion I have a firm testimony that this restored Church is led by our Savior Jesus Christ He knows whom to call as His Apostles and in what order to call them He also knows how to prepare His senior Apostle to be the prophet and President of the Church We were blessed this morning to hear our beloved prophet President Russell M Nelson deliver a profound bicentennial proclamation to the world with respect to the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ 2 This seminal declaration by President Nelson has made it clear that the Church of Jesus Christ owes its origin existence and direction for the future to the principle of continuous revelation The new proclamation represents a loving Father s communication to His children In an earlier day President Spencer W Kimball expressed the feelings I have today He stated Of all things that we should be most grateful for is that the heavens are indeed open and that the restored church of Jesus Christ is founded upon the rock of revelation Continuous revelation is indeed the very lifeblood of the gospel of the living Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 3The prophet Enoch foresaw the days in which we live The Lord acknowledged to Enoch the great wickedness that would prevail and prophesied of the great tribulations that would occur Nevertheless the Lord promised But my people will I preserve 4 And righteousness will I send down out of heaven and truth will I send forth out of the earth to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten 5President Ezra Taft Benson taught with great power that the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion came forth out of the earth in fulfillment of the Lord s pronouncement to Enoch The Father and the Son and angels and prophets appearing to the Prophet Joseph Smith were directed by heaven to restore the necessary powers to the kingdom 6The Prophet Joseph Smith received revelation after revelation Some have been addressed during this conference Many revelations received by the Prophet Joseph have been preserved for us in the Doctrine and Covenants All the standard works of the Church contain the mind and will of the Lord for us in this last dispensation 7In addition to these great foundational scriptures we are blessed with continuing revelation to living prophets Prophets are commissioned agents of the Lord authorized to speak for Him 8Some revelations are of monumental importance and others enhance our understanding of essential divine truths and provide guidance for our day 9We are incredibly grateful for the revelation to President Spencer W Kimball extending priesthood and temple blessings to all worthy male members of the Church in June 1978 10I have served with many of the Twelve who were present and participated when that precious revelation was received Each of them in personal conversations confirmed the powerful and uniting spiritual guidance President Kimball and they had experienced Many said it was the most powerful revelation they had received before or after that time 11Those of us currently serving in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have been blessed in our day as significant revelations have come through recent prophets 12 President Russell M Nelson has been a commissioned agent of the Lord especially with respect to revelations to help families build sanctuaries of faith in their homes gather scattered Israel on both sides of the veil and bless endowed members in sacred temple ordinance matters When important changes to bless our homes were announced at the October 2018 general conference I testified that in the deliberations of the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the temple after our beloved prophet petitioned the Lord for revelation a powerful confirmation was received by all 13At that time other revelations relating to sacred temple ordinances had been received but not announced or implemented 14 This guidance commenced with individual prophetic revelation to President Russell M Nelson and tender and powerful confirmation to those participating in the process President Nelson specifically involved the sisters who preside over the Relief Society Young Women and Primary organizations The final guidance in the temple to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was profoundly spiritual and powerful We each knew we had received the mind will and voice of the Lord 15I declare with all solemnity that continuous revelation has been received and is being received through channels the Lord has established I testify the new proclamation President Nelson delivered this morning is a revelation to bless all people We Extend an Invitation to All to Feast at the Lord s Table We also declare our heartfelt desire to be reunited with those who have been struggling with their testimonies been less active or had their names removed from Church records We desire to feast with you upon the words of Christ at the Lord s table to learn the things we all should do 16 We need you The Church needs you The Lord needs you Our heartfelt prayer is that you will join with us in worshipping the Savior of the world We know that some of you may have received offense unkindness or other conduct that is not Christlike We also know that some have had challenges to their faith that may not be fully appreciated understood or resolved Some of our most stalwart and faithful members have suffered a challenge to their faith for a season I love the true account of W W Phelps who had forsaken the Church and testified against the Prophet Joseph Smith in a Missouri court After repenting he wrote to Joseph I know my situation you know it and God knows it and I want to be saved if my friends will help me 17 Joseph did forgive him put him back to work and lovingly wrote Friends at first are friends again at last 18Brothers and sisters regardless of your situation please know that the Church and its members will welcome you back Personal Revelation to Guide Our LivesPersonal revelation is available to all those who humbly seek guidance from the Lord It is as important as prophetic revelation Personal spiritual revelation from the Holy Ghost has resulted in millions receiving the testimony necessary to be baptized and confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Personal revelation is the profound blessing received following baptism when we are sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost 19 I can remember a special spiritual revelation when I was 15 years old My precious brother was seeking guidance from the Lord as to how to respond to our dear father who did not want my brother to serve a mission I prayed with sincere intent too and received personal revelation of the truthfulness of the gospel The Role of the Holy GhostPersonal revelation is based on spiritual truths received from the Holy Ghost 20 The Holy Ghost is the revealer and testifier of all truth especially that of the Savior Without the Holy Ghost we could not really know that Jesus is the Christ His seminal role is to bear witness of the Father and the Son and Their titles and Their glory The Holy Ghost can influence everyone in a powerful way 21 This influence will not be constant unless one is baptized and receives the gift of the Holy Ghost The Holy Ghost serves also as a cleansing agent in the process of repentance and forgiveness The Spirit communicates in marvelous ways The Lord used this beautiful description I will tell you in your mind and in your heart by the Holy Ghost which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart Now behold this is the spirit of revelation 22Although its impact can be incredibly powerful it most often comes quietly as a still small voice 23 The scriptures include many examples of how the Spirit influences our minds including speaking peace to our minds 24 occupying our minds 25 enlightening our minds 26 and even sending a voice to our minds 27Some principles that prepare us to receive revelation include Praying for spiritual guidance Reverently and humbly we need to seek and ask28 and be patient and submissive 29Preparing for inspiration This requires that we be in harmony with the Lord s teachings and in compliance with His commandments Partaking of the sacrament worthily When we do this we witness and covenant with God that we take upon ourselves the name of His holy Son and that we remember Him and keep His commandments These principles prepare us to receive recognize and follow the prompting and guidance of the Holy Ghost This includes the peaceable things which bringeth joy and life eternal 30Our spiritual preparation is greatly enhanced when we regularly study the scriptures and truths of the gospel and ponder in our minds the guidance we seek But remember to be patient and trust in the Lord s timing Guidance is given by an omniscient Lord when He deliberately chooses to school us 31Revelation in Our Callings and AssignmentsThe Holy Ghost will also provide revelation in our callings and assignments In my experience significant spiritual guidance most often comes when we are trying to bless others in fulfilling our responsibilities I can remember as a young bishop receiving a desperate call from a married couple a short time before I was to catch an airplane for a business engagement I pled with the Lord before their arrival to know how I could bless them It was revealed to me the nature of the problem and the response I should give That revelatory guidance allowed me to fulfill the sacred responsibilities of my calling as bishop despite very limited availability of time Bishops all over the world also share these same kinds of experiences with me As a stake president I not only received important revelation but also received personal correction that was necessary to accomplish the Lord s purposes I assure you that revelatory guidance can be received by each of us as we humbly labor in the Lord s vineyard Most of our guidance comes from the Holy Ghost Sometimes and for some purposes it comes directly from the Lord I personally testify that this is true Guidance for the Church as a whole comes to the President and prophet of the Church We as modern Apostles have had the privilege of working and traveling with our current prophet President Nelson I paraphrase what Wilford Woodruff said about the Prophet Joseph Smith it is equally true of President Nelson I have seen the workings of the Spirit of God with him and the revelations of Jesus Christ unto him and the fulfillment of those revelations 32My humble plea today is that each of us will seek continuing revelation to guide our lives and follow the Spirit as we worship God the Father in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ of whom I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Thank you dear President Nelson for that joyful revelatory guidance with respect to witnesses at baptisms and the direction you have asked us to share to help strengthen youth and develop their sacred potential Before I share those adjustments we express our sincere appreciation for the exceptional way members have responded to developments in the ongoing Restoration of the gospel As President Nelson suggested last year you have taken your vitamins 1You joyfully study Come Follow Me at home 2 You have also responded to adjustments at church Members of the elders quorum and Relief Society sisters unitedly do the work of salvation 3Our gratitude is overflowing 4 We are particularly grateful that our youth continue to remain strong and faithful Our youth live in an exciting but also challenging time The choices available have never been more dramatic One example the modern smartphone provides access to incredibly important and uplifting information including family history and the holy scriptures On the other hand it contains foolishness immorality and evil not readily available in the past To help our youth navigate this maze of choices the Church has prepared three profound and comprehensive initiatives First curriculum has been strengthened and expanded to the home Second a children and youth program that includes exciting activities and personal development was presented just last Sunday by President Russell M Nelson President M Russell Ballard and the General Officers A third initiative is organizational changes to make youth a more significant focus of our bishops and other leaders This focus must be spiritually powerful and help our youth become the youth battalion President Nelson has asked them to become Interlocking PatternsThese efforts together with those announced during the last few years are not isolated changes Each of the adjustments is an integral part of an interlocking pattern to bless the Saints and prepare them to meet God One part of the pattern relates to the rising generation Our youth are being asked to take more individual responsibility at younger ages without parents and leaders taking over what youth can do for themselves 5AnnouncementToday we announce organizational changes for youth at ward and stake levels As President Nelson explained Sister Bonnie H Cordon will discuss changes for young women this evening One purpose for the changes I will now discuss is to strengthen Aaronic Priesthood holders quorums and quorum presidencies These changes align our practice with Doctrine and Covenants 107 15 which reads The bishopric is the presidency of this Aaronic priesthood and holds the keys or authority of the same One of the scriptural duties of the bishop is to preside over the priests and to sit in council with them teaching them the duties of their office 6 In addition the first counselor in the bishopric will have specific responsibility for teachers and the second counselor for deacons Accordingly to align with this revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants Young Men presidencies at the ward level will be discontinued These faithful brethren have done much good and we express appreciation to them It is our hope that bishoprics will give great emphasis and focus to the priesthood responsibilities of young men and help them in their quorum duties Capable adult Young Men advisers will be called to assist the Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies and the bishopric in their duties 7 We are confident that more young men and young women will rise to the challenge and stay on the covenant path because of this laser like focus on our youth In the Lord s inspired pattern the bishop has responsibility for everyone in the ward He blesses the parents of youth as well as the youth One bishop found that as he counseled with a young man struggling with pornography he could help the young man in his repentance only as he helped the parents react with love and understanding The young man s healing was a healing for his family and was possible through the bishop working in behalf of the entire family The young man has now become a worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holder and full time missionary As this account suggests these adjustments will Help bishops and their counselors focus on their core responsibilities to the youth and Primary children Place the power and duties of the Aaronic Priesthood at the center of every young man s personal life and goals These adjustments also Emphasize the responsibilities of Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies and their direct reporting line to the bishopric Motivate adult leaders to assist and mentor Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies in magnifying the power and authority of their office As noted these adjustments do not lessen the bishopric s responsibility for young women As President Nelson just taught The bishop s first and foremost responsibility is to care for the young men and young women of his ward 8How will our beloved and hard working bishops fulfill this responsibility As you remember in 2018 Melchizedek Priesthood quorums were adjusted to work even more closely with Relief Societies so that elders quorums and Relief Societies can under the direction of the bishop help shoulder important responsibilities that previously consumed much of his time These responsibilities include missionary work and temple and family history work in the ward9 as well as much of the ministering to ward members The bishop cannot delegate some responsibilities such as strengthening the youth being a common judge caring for those in need and overseeing finances and temporal affairs These are however fewer than we may have understood in the past As Elder Jeffrey R Holland explained last year when the adjustments to the Melchizedek Priesthood quorums were announced The bishop remains of course the presiding high priest of the ward This new alignment of elders quorums and Relief Societies should let him preside over the work of the Melchizedek Priesthood and the Relief Society without requiring him to do the work of either of those bodies 10For instance a Relief Society president and an elders quorum president as assigned can take a greater role in counseling with adults as can a Young Women president in counseling with young women While only the bishop can serve as a common judge these other leaders are also entitled to revelation from heaven to help with challenges that do not require a common judge or involve abuse of any kind 11That doesn t mean a young woman cannot or should not talk to the bishop or to her parents Their focus is the youth But it does mean that a Young Women leader may best meet the needs of an individual young woman The bishopric is as concerned for young women as for young men but we recognize the strength that comes from having strong engaged and focused Young Women leaders who love and mentor not taking over the roles of class presidencies but helping youth succeed in those roles Sister Cordon will share additional exciting changes for young women tonight I however announce that ward Young Women presidents will now report to and counsel directly with the bishop of the ward In the past this assignment could be delegated to a counselor but going forward young women will be a direct responsibility of the one who holds presiding keys for the ward The Relief Society president will continue to report directly to the bishop 12At the general and stake levels we will continue to have Young Men presidencies At the stake level a high councilor will be the Young Men president13 and will with the high councilors assigned to Young Women and Primary be part of the stake Aaronic Priesthood Young Women committee These brethren will work with the stake Young Women presidency on this committee With a counselor to the stake president as chair this committee will have increased importance because many of the programs and activities in the new Children and Youth initiative will be at the stake level These high councilors under the direction of the stake presidency can serve as a resource to the bishop and Aaronic Priesthood quorums in a manner similar to the service provided by high councilors to ward elders quorums As a related matter another high councilor will serve as the stake Sunday School president and as needed could serve on the stake Aaronic Priesthood Young Women committee 14Additional organizational changes will be further explained in information sent to leaders These changes include The bishopric youth committee meeting will be replaced by a ward youth council The word Mutual will be retired and become Young Women activities Aaronic Priesthood quorum activities or youth activities which will be held weekly where possible The ward budget for youth activities will be divided equitably between the young men and young women according to the number of youth in each organization A sufficient amount will be provided for Primary activities At all levels ward stake and general we will use the term organization rather than the term auxiliary Those who lead the General Relief Society Young Women Young Men Primary and Sunday School organizations will be known as General Officers Those who lead organizations at the ward and stake levels will be known as ward officers and stake officers 15The adjustments announced today may begin as soon as branches wards districts and stakes are ready but should be in place by January 1 2020 These adjustments when combined and integrated with previous adjustments represent a spiritual and organizational effort consistent with doctrine to bless and strengthen every man woman youth and child helping each to follow the example of our Savior Jesus Christ as we progress on the covenant path Dear brothers and sisters I promise and testify that these comprehensive adjustments under the direction of an inspired president and prophet Russell M Nelson will empower and strengthen every member of the Church Our youth will develop greater faith in the Savior be protected from the temptations of the adversary and stand prepared to meet life s challenges In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brothers and sisters this is a unique and pivotal time in history We are blessed to live in the last dispensation before the Second Coming of the Savior Near the commencement of this dispensation in 1829 the year before the Church was formally organized a beloved revelation was received declaring that a marvelous work was about to come forth This revelation established that those who desired to serve God qualify for such service through faith hope charity and love with an eye single to the glory of God 1 Charity which is the pure love of Christ 2 includes God s eternal love for all His children 3My purpose this morning is to emphasize the essential role of that kind of love in missionary work temple and family history work and home centered Church supported family religious observance Love of the Savior and love of our fellow men and women4 is the primary attribute and motive for ministering and the spiritual purposes5 we were charged to undertake by our beloved prophet President Russell M Nelson in the adjustments announced in 2018 Missionary Effort to Gather Scattered IsraelI was exposed to the relationship between missionary work and love early in my life When I was 11 years old I received a patriarchal blessing from a patriarch who was also my grandfather 6 That blessing said in part I bless you with great love for your fellowmen for thou shalt be called to carry the gospel to the world to win souls unto Christ 7I understood even at that early age that sharing the gospel was based on a great love for all our Heavenly Father s children As General Authorities assigned to work on Preach My Gospel 15 years ago we concluded that the attribute of love was essential to missionary work in our day just as it has always been Chapter 6 on Christlike attributes including charity and love has consistently been the most popular chapter among missionaries As emissaries of the Savior most missionaries feel this kind of love and when they do their efforts are blessed When members gain a vision of this kind of love which is essential in assisting the Lord in His purpose the Lord s work will be accomplished I was privileged to have a small role in a marvelous example of this kind of love When I was serving as President of the Pacific Islands Area I received a call from President R Wayne Shute As a young man he served a mission in Samoa Later he returned to Samoa as a mission president 8 When he telephoned me he was the Apia Samoa Temple president One of his young missionaries when he was mission president was Elder O Vincent Haleck who is now the Area President in the Pacific President Shute had great love and respect for Vince and the entire Haleck family Most of the family were members of the Church but Vince s father Otto Haleck the patriarch of the family of German and Samoan descent was not a member President Shute knew I was attending a stake conference and other meetings in American Samoa and he asked me if I would consider staying in Otto Haleck s residence with the view of sharing the gospel with him My wife Mary and I stayed with Otto and his wife Dorothy in their beautiful home At breakfast I shared a gospel message and invited Otto to meet with the missionaries He was kind but firm in refusing my invitation He said he was pleased that many members of his family were Latter day Saints But he forcefully indicated that some of his Samoan mother s ancestors had been early Christian ministers in Samoa and he felt a great allegiance to their traditional Christian faith 9 Nevertheless we left as good friends Later when President Gordon B Hinckley was preparing to dedicate the Suva Fiji Temple he had his personal secretary Brother Don H Staheli 10 call me in New Zealand to make arrangements President Hinckley wanted to fly from Fiji to American Samoa to meet the Saints A certain hotel used in a previous visit was suggested I asked if I could make different arrangements Brother Staheli said You are the Area President that would be fine I immediately called President Shute and told him that perhaps we had a second chance at spiritually blessing our friend Otto Haleck This time the missionary would be President Gordon B Hinckley I asked if he thought it would be appropriate for the Halecks to host all of us in President Hinckley s travel group 11 President and Sister Hinckley their daughter Jane and Elder and Sister Jeffrey R Holland were also part of the travel group President Shute working with the family made all the arrangements 12When we arrived from Fiji after the temple dedication we were warmly greeted 13 We spoke that evening to thousands of Samoan members and then proceeded to the Haleck family compound When we gathered for breakfast the next morning President Hinckley and Otto Haleck had already become good friends It was interesting to me that they were having much the same conversation I had had with Otto more than a year earlier When Otto expressed his admiration for our Church but reaffirmed his commitment to his existing church President Hinckley put his hand on Otto s shoulder and said Otto that s not good enough you ought to be a member of the Church This is the Lord s Church You figuratively could see the resistive armor fall away from Otto with an openness to what President Hinckley said This was the beginning of additional missionary teaching and a spiritual humility that allowed Otto Haleck to be baptized and confirmed a little over a year later One year after that the Haleck family was sealed as an eternal family in the temple 14What touched my heart throughout this incredible experience was the overwhelming ministering love exhibited by President Wayne Shute for his former missionary Elder Vince Haleck and his desire to see the entire Haleck family united as an eternal family 15When it comes to gathering Israel we need to align our hearts with this kind of love and move away from feelings of mere responsibility16 or guilt to feelings of love and participation in the divine partnership of sharing the Savior s message ministry and mission with the world 17As members we can show our love for the Savior and our brothers and sisters throughout the world by making simple invitations The new Sunday meeting schedule represents an exceptional opportunity for members to successfully and lovingly invite friends and associates to come and see and feel a Church experience 18 A spiritual sacrament meeting hopefully as sacred as what Elder Jeffrey R Holland described yesterday will be followed by a 50 minute meeting focused on the New Testament and the Savior or relevant conference addresses also focused on the Savior and His doctrine Some Relief Society sisters have wondered why they have been given a gathering assignment along with priesthood quorum members There are reasons for this and President Nelson set forth many of them in the last general conference He concluded We simply cannot gather Israel without you 19 In our day we are blessed that approximately 30 percent of our full time missionaries are sisters This provides additional incentive for Relief Society sisters to lovingly share the gospel What is needed is a loving compassionate spiritual commitment by each of us men women youth and children to share the gospel of Jesus Christ If we show love kindness and humility many will accept our invitation Those who choose not to accept our invitation will still be our friends Temple and Family History Effort to Gather IsraelLove is also at the center of our temple and family history effort to gather Israel on the other side of the veil When we learn of the trials and hardships our ancestors faced our love and appreciation for them is magnified Our temple and family history effort has been strengthened to a significant degree by the new adjustments in both the Sunday meeting schedule and the youth advancement in classes and quorums These changes provide for earlier and more powerful attention to learning about our ancestors and gathering Israel on the other side of the veil Both temple and family history work are greatly enhanced The internet is a powerful tool the home is now our primary family history center Our young members are exceptionally skilled in family history research and are spiritually motivated to perform baptisms for their ancestors whom they have learned to love and appreciate Since the change allowing many 11 year olds to perform baptisms for the dead temple presidents across the world report greatly increased attendance One temple president informs us that there has been a remarkable increase in baptismal patrons and the addition of 11 year olds brings more families Even at their young age they appear to sense reverence and purpose for the ordinance they are performing It is beautiful to watch 20I know our Primary and youth leaders are making and will continue to make family history and temple work a major effort Relief Society sisters and priesthood brethren can lovingly help fulfill their temple and family history responsibility individually and also by assisting and inspiring children and youth to gather Israel on the other side of the veil This is particularly important in the home and on the Sabbath I promise that lovingly performing ordinances for ancestors will strengthen and protect our youth and families in a world that is becoming increasingly evil I also personally testify that President Russell M Nelson has received profoundly important revelations relating to temples and temple work Prepare Eternal Families and Individuals to Live with GodThe new emphasis on home centered gospel study and living and the resources that are provided by the Church are a great opportunity for lovingly preparing eternal families and individuals to meet and live with God 21When a man and woman are sealed in the temple they enter the holy order of matrimony in the new and everlasting covenant an order of the priesthood 22 Together they obtain and receive priesthood blessings and power to direct the affairs of their family Women and men have unique roles as outlined in The Family A Proclamation to the World 23 but their stewardships are equal in value and importance 24 They have equal power to receive revelation for their family When they work together in love and righteousness their decisions are heaven blessed Those who seek to know the will of the Lord as individuals and for their families must strive for righteousness meekness kindness and love Humility and love are the hallmark of those who seek the Lord s will especially for their families Perfecting ourselves qualifying ourselves for the blessings of covenants and preparing to meet God are individual responsibilities We need to be self reliant and anxiously engaged in making our homes a refuge from the storms that surround us25 and a sanctuary of faith 26 Parents have a responsibility to lovingly teach their children Homes filled with love are a joy a delight and a literal heaven on earth 27My mother s favorite hymn was Love at Home 28 Whenever she heard the first phrase There is beauty all around when there s love at home she became visibly touched and teary As children we were aware that we lived in that kind of home it was one of her highest priorities 29In addition to encouraging a loving atmosphere in the home President Nelson has focused on limiting media use that disrupts our primary purposes 30 One adjustment that will benefit almost any family is to make the internet social media and television a servant instead of a distraction or even worse a master The war for the souls of all but particularly children is often in the home As parents we need to make sure that media content is wholesome age appropriate and consistent with the loving atmosphere we are trying to create Teaching in our homes needs to be clear and compelling31 but also spiritual joyful and full of love I promise that as we focus on our love for the Savior and His Atonement make Him the centerpiece of our efforts to gather Israel on both sides of the veil minister to others and individually prepare to meet God the influence of the adversary will be diminished and the joy delight and peace of the gospel will magnify our homes with Christlike love 32 I testify of these doctrinal promises and bear a sure witness of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice in our behalf in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As President Russell M Nelson has just beautifully and eloquently set forth Church leaders have been working for a long time on a home centered and Church supported plan to learn doctrine strengthen faith and foster greater personal worship President Nelson then announced an adjustment to achieve a new balance and connection between gospel instruction in the home and in the Church 1To accomplish these purposes described by and under the direction of President Russell M Nelson and pursuant to the decision of the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles the Sunday meeting schedule will be adjusted in the following ways beginning in January 2019 Sunday Meeting ScheduleThe Sunday Church meetings will consist of a 60 minute sacrament meeting each Sunday focused on the Savior the ordinance of the sacrament and spiritual messages After time for transition to classes Church members will attend a 50 minute class that will alternate each Sunday Sunday School will be held on the first and third Sundays of the month Priesthood quorums Relief Society and Young Women meetings will be held on the second and fourth Sundays Meetings on the fifth Sunday will be under the direction of the bishop Primary will be held each week during this same 50 minute period and will include singing time and classes With respect to the Sunday meeting schedule the senior leaders of the Church have been aware for many years that for some of our precious members a three hour Sunday schedule at church can be difficult This is particularly true for parents with small children Primary children elderly members new converts and others 2But there is so much more to this adjustment than just shortening the Sunday meetinghouse schedule President Nelson has acknowledged with gratitude how much is being accomplished as a result of your faithfulness to previous invitations He and the entire leadership of the Church desire to bring greater gospel joy to parents children youth singles the elderly new converts and those people the missionaries are teaching through a home centered Church supported balanced effort The purposes and blessings associated with this adjustment and other recent changes include the following Deepening conversion to Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthening faith in Them Strengthening individuals and families through home centered Church supported curriculum that contributes to joyful gospel living Honoring the Sabbath day with a focus on the ordinance of the sacrament Helping all of Heavenly Father s children on both sides of the veil through missionary work and receiving ordinances and covenants and blessings of the temple Home Centered Church Supported Gospel LearningThis Sunday schedule allows more time for a home evening and to study the gospel at home on Sunday or at other times as individuals and families may choose A family activity night could be held on Monday or at other times To this end leaders should continue to keep Monday evenings free from Church meetings and activities However time spent in home evening gospel study and activities for individuals and families may be scheduled according to their individual circumstances Family and individual gospel study at home will be significantly enhanced by a harmonized curriculum and a new Come Follow Me resource for individuals and families that is coordinated with what is being taught in Sunday School and Primary 3 In January the Church s youth and adult Sunday School and Primary classes will be studying the New Testament The new home study Come Follow Me resource for individuals and families also covering the New Testament is designed to help members learn the gospel in the home It explains This resource is for every individual and family in the Church It is designed to help us better learn the gospel whether on our own or with our family The outlines in this new resource are organized according to a weekly schedule 4The new Primary Come Follow Me lessons taught in church will follow the same weekly schedule The adult and youth Sunday School classes on the first and third Sundays will be coordinated so that they will support the new Come Follow Me home resource On the second and fourth Sundays adults in priesthood and Relief Society will continue to study the teachings of Church leaders with emphasis on the current messages of modern prophets 5 Young women and Aaronic Priesthood young men will study gospel topics on those Sundays The new home study resource provides Ideas for Family Scripture Study and Family Home Evening 6 The outlines for each week contain helpful study ideas and activities for individuals and families The Come Follow Me resource for individuals and families also has many illustrations that will help enhance individual and family learning especially for children 7 This new resource will be provided to each household by December of this year President Nelson from his initial address to the members of the Church in January has exhorted us to prepare for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ by walking the covenant path 8World conditions increasingly require deepening individual conversion to and strengthening faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and His Atonement The Lord has prepared us line upon line for the perilous times that we now face In recent years the Lord has guided us to address related core concerns including Honoring the Sabbath day and the sacred ordinance of the sacrament has again been emphasized for the last three years Under the bishop s direction strengthened elders quorums and Relief Societies are focused on the purpose and divinely appointed responsibilities of the Church9 and helping members make and keep sacred covenants Ministering in a higher and holier way is being joyfully adopted Beginning with the end in mind temple covenants and family history service are becoming a purposeful part of the covenant path The adjustment announced this morning is yet another example of guidance for the challenges of our day The Church s traditional curriculum has emphasized the Sunday Church experience We know that when we have better teaching and more spiritually prepared class members we have a better Sunday Church experience We are blessed that often the Spirit increases and strengthens conversion in the Church setting The new home centered and Church supported curriculum needs to influence more powerfully family religious observance and behavior and personal religious observance and behavior We know the spiritual impact and the deep and lasting conversion that can be achieved in the home setting Years ago a study established that for young men and women the influence of the Holy Ghost most often accompanies individual scripture study and prayer in the home Our purpose is to balance the Church and the home experiences in a way that will greatly increase faith and spirituality and deepen conversion to Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ In the home centered Church supported portion of this adjustment there is flexibility for each individual and family to determine prayerfully how and when it will be implemented For example while this will greatly bless all families based on local needs it would be completely appropriate for young singles single adults single parents part member families new members 10 and others to gather in groups outside the normal Sunday worship services to enjoy gospel sociality and be strengthened by studying together the home centered Church supported resource This would be accomplished informally by those who so desire In many parts of the world people choose to stay at the meetinghouse after the normal Sunday schedule to enjoy social relationships There is nothing in this announced adjustment that would interfere with this wonderful and rewarding practice in any way To help members prepare for the Sabbath some wards already send an informative email text or social media message midweek In view of this adjustment we strongly recommend this type of communication These invitations will remind the members of the Sunday meeting schedule for that week including the upcoming class lesson topic and support continuing gospel conversation at home In addition the adult meetings on Sunday will also provide information to connect church and home study each week The sacrament meeting and the class period will require prayerful consideration to make sure that spiritual priorities are emphasized over administrative functions For example announcements can for the most part be accomplished in the midweek invitation or on a printed program While the sacrament meeting should have an opening and closing prayer the second meeting need only have a closing prayer 11As was mentioned earlier the new Sunday schedule will not commence until January 2019 There are several reasons for this The two most important are first to have time to distribute the Come Follow Me resource for individuals and families and second to allow time for stake presidents and bishops to arrange meeting schedules with the goal of having more wards meet earlier in the day As leaders have sought revelation the guidance received over the past few years is to strengthen the sacrament meeting honor the Sabbath day and encourage and assist parents and individuals to make their homes a source of spiritual strength and increased faith a place of joy and happiness Extraordinary BlessingsWhat do these adjustments mean for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints We are confident that members will be blessed in extraordinary ways Sunday can be a day of gospel learning and teaching at church and in the home As individuals and families engage in family councils family history ministering service personal worship and joyful family time the Sabbath day will truly be a delight One family from Brazil are members of a stake where the new home Come Follow Me resource was tested The father Fernando a returned missionary who with his wife Nancy are the parents of four young children reported When the Come Follow Me program was introduced in our stake I was so excited and I thought the way that we study the scriptures at home is going to change It really happened in my home and as a Church leader I saw that it happened in other homes It helped us to really discuss the scriptures in our home My wife and I had a deeper understanding about the topic studied It helped us amplify our gospel knowledge and enhance our faith and testimony I bear my testimony that I know it was inspired by the Lord so that the consistent and effective study of the principles and doctrines contained in the scriptures brings more faith testimony and light to the families in an increasingly fallen world 12In pilot test stakes across the world there was a highly favorable response to the new Come Follow Me home resource Many reported that they progressed from reading scriptures to actually studying the scriptures It was also commonly felt the experience was faith promoting and had a wonderful impact on the ward 13Deep and Lasting ConversionThe goal of these adjustments is to obtain a deep and lasting conversion of adults and the rising generation The first page of the individual and family resource points out The aim of all gospel learning and teaching is to deepen our conversion and help us become more like Jesus Christ This means relying on Christ to change our hearts 14 This is assisted by reaching beyond a classroom into an individual s heart and home It requires consistent daily efforts to understand and live the gospel True conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost 15The most important goal and ultimate blessing of deep and lasting conversion is worthily receiving the covenants and ordinances of the covenant pathway 16We trust you to counsel together and to seek revelation for implementing these adjustments while not looking beyond the mark or trying to regiment individuals or families Additional information will be shared in upcoming communications including a First Presidency letter and enclosure I testify to you that in the deliberations of the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the temple and after our beloved prophet petitioned the Lord for revelation to move forward with these adjustments a powerful confirmation was received by all Russell M Nelson is our living President and prophet The announcements made today will result in profound blessings for those who enthusiastically embrace the adjustments and seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost We will become closer to our Heavenly Father and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ of whom I am a sure witness In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Eliza R Snow speaking of the Kirtland Temple dedication which she attended said The ceremonies of that dedication may be rehearsed but no mortal language can describe the heavenly manifestations of that memorable day Angels appeared to some while a sense of divine presence was realized by all present and each heart was filled with joy inexpressible and full of glory 1The divine manifestations that occurred in the Kirtland Temple were foundational to the purpose of the restored Church of Jesus Christ to bring to pass the salvation and exaltation of our Heavenly Father s children 2 As we prepare to meet God we can know what our divinely appointed responsibilities are by reviewing the sacred keys restored in the Kirtland Temple In the dedicatory prayer the Prophet Joseph Smith humbly petitioned the Lord to accept of this house which thou didst command us to build 3One week later on Easter Sunday the Lord appeared in a magnificent vision and accepted His temple This occurred on April 3 1836 almost exactly 182 years ago from this Easter Sunday It was also the Passover season one of those rare times when Easter and Passover overlap After the vision closed three ancient prophets Moses Elias and Elijah appeared and committed keys which were essential to accomplish the Lord s purpose for His restored Church in this dispensation That purpose has been simply but eloquently defined as gathering Israel sealing them as families and preparing the world for the Lord s Second Coming 4For both Elijah and Moses to appear was a striking parallel with Jewish tradition according to which Moses and Elijah would arrive together at the end of time 5 In our doctrine this appearance accomplished the foundational restoration of certain keys given for the last days and for the last time in the which is the dispensation of the fulness of times 6The Kirtland Temple both in location and size was relatively obscure But in terms of its enormous significance to mankind it was eternity shaping Ancient prophets restored priesthood keys for the eternal saving ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ This resulted in overwhelming joy for faithful members These keys provide the power from on high 7 for divinely appointed responsibilities that constitute the primary purpose of the Church 8 On that wonderful Easter day in the Kirtland Temple three keys were restored First Moses appeared and committed the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth which is missionary work 9Second Elias appeared and committed the keys of the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham which includes the restoration of the Abrahamic covenant 10 President Russell M Nelson has taught that the purpose of the covenant keys is to prepare members for the kingdom of God He said We know who we are and we know what God expects of us 11Third Elijah appeared and committed the keys of the sealing power in this dispensation which is family history work and temple ordinances enabling salvation for the living and the dead 12There are under the direction of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve three executive councils at Church headquarters that oversee these divinely appointed responsibilities based on the keys that were restored in the Kirtland Temple They are the Missionary Executive Council the Priesthood and Family Executive Council and the Temple and Family History Executive Council Where Do We Stand Today in Fulfilling These Divinely Appointed Responsibilities First with respect to Moses s restoration of the keys for the gathering of Israel today almost 70 000 missionaries are spread across the earth preaching His gospel to gather His elect This is the commencement of the fulfillment of the great and marvelous work Nephi foresaw among both the Gentiles and the house of Israel Nephi saw our time when the Saints of God would be upon all the face of the earth but their numbers would be small because of wickedness However he foresaw that they would be armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory 13 When viewed across the brief history of the restored Church the missionary effort has been most remarkable We are seeing the fulfillment of Nephi s vision Though our numbers are relatively few we will continue our effort and outreach to those who will respond to the Savior s message Second Elias appeared and committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham declaring that in us and our seed all generations after us should be blessed In this conference significant guidance has been presented to assist in perfecting the Saints and preparing them for the kingdom of God 14 The announcement in the priesthood session with respect to elders and high priests quorums will unleash priesthood power and authority Home and visiting teaching now ministering as taught so eloquently in this session will prepare Latter day Saints to meet God Third Elijah committed the sealing keys of this dispensation For those of us alive at this time the increase in temples and family history work is phenomenal This pace will continue and accelerate until the Second Coming of the Savior lest the whole earth be utterly wasted at his coming 15Family history work heaven blessed by technology has dramatically increased in the past few years We would be unwise to become complacent about this divinely appointed responsibility and expect that Aunt Jane or some other committed relative will take care of it Let me share President Joseph Fielding Smith s jarring comments None is exempt from this great obligation It is required of the apostle as well as the humblest elder or sister Place or distinction or long service in the Church will not entitle one to disregard the salvation of one s dead 16We now have temples across the world and the resources of the patron assistance fund to help those in need who are far from a temple As individuals we would do well to evaluate our effort in pursuing missionary work temple and family history work and preparations to meet God Righteousness Unity and Equality before the Lord Undergird These Sacred ResponsibilitiesWith respect to righteousness this life is the time for all of us to prepare to meet God 17 The Book of Mormon provides multiple examples of the tragic consequences when individuals or groups fail to keep the commandments of God 18During my lifetime worldly issues and concerns have moved from one extreme to another from frivolous and trivial pursuits to serious immorality It is commendable that nonconsensual immorality has been exposed and denounced 19 Such nonconsensual immorality is against the laws of God and of society Those who understand God s plan should also oppose consensual immorality which is also a sin The family proclamation to the world warns that individuals who violate covenants of chastity who abuse spouse or offspring or for that matter anyone else will one day stand accountable before God 20As we look around we see the devastation of wickedness and addiction at every turn If as individuals we are really concerned about the Savior s ultimate judgment of us we should seek repentance I am afraid many people no longer feel accountable to God and do not turn to the scriptures or the prophets for guidance If we as a society would contemplate the consequences of sin there would be massive public opposition to pornography and the objectification of women 21 As Alma told his son Corianton in the Book of Mormon Wickedness never was happiness 22In regard to unity the Savior declared If ye are not one ye are not mine 23 We know that the spirit of contention is of the devil 24In our day the scriptural imperative for unity is largely ignored and for many people the emphasis is on tribalism 25 often based on status gender race and wealth In many countries if not most people are deeply divided about how to live In the Lord s Church the only culture we adhere to and teach is the culture of the gospel of Jesus Christ The unity we seek is to be unified with the Savior and His teachings 26As we look at the primary purposes of the Church they are all based on equality before the Lord27 and following the culture of the gospel of Jesus Christ With respect to missionary work the principal qualifications for baptism are humbling oneself before God and coming forth with a broken heart and contrite spirit 28 Education wealth race or national origin are not even considered In addition missionaries humbly serve where called They do not attempt to serve based on worldly standards of status or preparation for future careers They serve with all their heart might mind and strength wherever they are assigned They do not choose their missionary companions and they seek diligently to develop Christlike attributes 29 which are at the heart of the culture of Jesus Christ The scriptures give guidance for our most important relationships The Savior taught that the first commandment was to love the Lord thy God And the second is to love thy neighbour as thyself 30The Savior additionally explained that everyone is our neighbor 31 The Book of Mormon makes it clear that there must be no ites tribes or classes 32 We must be united and equal before God Sacred ordinances and divine responsibilities are built upon this premise I would expect that your own experiences in the temple would be similar to mine When I would leave my workaday world in San Francisco and arrive at the Oakland Temple I would experience an overwhelming feeling of love and peace A major part of that was sensing I was closer to God and His purposes The saving ordinances were my primary focus but a significant part of those beautiful feelings was the equality and unity that permeate the temple Everyone is dressed in white clothing There is no evidence of wealth rank or educational attainment we are all brothers and sisters humbling ourselves before God In the sacred sealing room the eternal marriage ordinance is the same for everyone I love the fact that the couple from the humblest background and the couple from the wealthiest background have exactly the same experience They wear the same type of robes and make the same covenants across the same altar They also receive the same eternal priesthood blessings This is accomplished in a beautiful temple built by the tithes of the Saints as the sacred house of the Lord Fulfilling divinely appointed responsibilities based on righteousness unity and equality before the Lord brings personal happiness and peace in this world and prepares us for eternal life in the world to come 33 It prepares us to meet God 34We pray that each of you regardless of your current circumstances will counsel with your bishop and be worthy of a temple recommend 35We are grateful that many more members are preparing to go to the temple There has been a significant increase in the number of worthy adult temple recommend holders for many years Limited use recommends for worthy youth have increased dramatically over the last two years Clearly the faithful core membership of the Church has never been stronger In conclusion please be assured that senior Church leaders who preside over the divinely appointed purposes of the Church receive divine assistance This guidance comes from the Spirit and sometimes directly from the Savior Both kinds of spiritual guidance are given I am grateful to have received such assistance But guidance is given in the Lord s time line upon line and precept upon precept 36 when an omniscient Lord deliberately chooses to school us 37 Guidance for the Church as a whole comes only to His prophet We have all had the privilege of sustaining President Russell M Nelson as our prophet and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in this conference The Twelve as a group and individually had a significant spiritual experience when we laid our hands on President Nelson s head and President Dallin H Oaks acting as voice ordained him and set him apart as President of the Church I testify that he was foreordained and has been prepared his entire life to be the Lord s prophet for our day In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Since my service in the British Mission as a young man I have enjoyed British humor It is sometimes characterized by a self deprecating modest humble approach to life An example of this is how summer is portrayed British summers are relatively short and unpredictable As one author in a low key way said I love the British summer it s my favourite day of the year 1 A favorite British cartoon character of mine was pictured in her bed waking up late in the morning and declaring to her dogs Oh my goodness I think we ve overslept and missed summer 2There is an analogy in this humor to our life on this beautiful earth The scriptures are clear that our precious mortal existence is a very short time It could be said that from an eternal perspective our time on earth is as fleeting as a British summer 3Sometimes man s purpose and very existence are also described in very humble terms The prophet Moses was raised in what some today might call a privileged background As recorded in the Pearl of Great Price the Lord preparing Moses for his prophetic assignment gives him an overview of the world and all the children of men which are and were created 4 Moses s somewhat surprising reaction was Now I know that man is nothing which thing I never had supposed 5Subsequently God in what amounts to a rebuttal to any feelings of unimportance that Moses may have felt proclaimed His true purpose For behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 6We are all equal before God His doctrine is clear In the Book of Mormon we read All are alike unto God including black and white bond and free male and female 7 Accordingly all are invited to come to the Lord 8Anyone who claims superiority under the Father s plan because of characteristics like race sex nationality language or economic circumstances is morally wrong and does not understand the Lord s true purpose for all of our Father s children 9Unfortunately in our day in almost every segment of society we see self importance and arrogance flaunted while humility and accountability to God are denigrated Much of society has lost its moorings and does not understand why we are on this earth True humility which is essential to achieve the Lord s purpose for us is seldom evident 10It is important to understand the magnitude of Christ s humility righteousness character and intelligence as exemplified in the scriptures It is foolish to underestimate the necessity of continuously striving for these Christlike qualities and attributes on a day by day basis particularly humility 11The scriptures are clear that while this life is relatively short it is incredibly significant Amulek who was a missionary companion of Alma in the Book of Mormon said This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God yea behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors 12 We do not want like my cartoon character to sleep through this life The Savior s example of humility and sacrifice for all mankind is the most profound event in history The Savior even as a member of the Godhead was willing to come to earth as a lowly infant and begin an existence that included teaching and healing His brothers and sisters and ultimately suffering indescribable pain in Gethsemane and on the cross in order to perfect His Atonement This act of love and humility on the part of Christ is known as His condescension 13 He did this for every man and woman God has created or will create Our Heavenly Father does not want His children to be discouraged or to give up on their quest for celestial glory When we really contemplate God the Father and Christ the Son who They are and what They have accomplished on our behalf it fills us with reverence awe gratitude and humility Humility Is Essential in Helping the Lord Establish His ChurchAlma asked a question in his day that is pertinent today If ye have experienced a change of heart and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love I would ask can ye feel so now 14 Alma continued Could ye say if ye were called to die at this time that ye have been sufficiently humble 15Every time I read about Alma the Younger relinquishing his role as head of state to preach the word of God 16 I am impressed Alma clearly had a profound testimony of God the Father and Jesus Christ and felt accountable to Them completely and without reservation He had the correct priorities and humility to give up status and position because he realized that serving the Lord was more important Having sufficient humility in our lives to help establish the Church is particularly valuable An example in Church history is revealing In June of 1837 the Prophet Joseph was inspired while in the Kirtland Temple to call Apostle Heber C Kimball to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to England and open the door of salvation to that nation 17 Apostle Orson Hyde and a few others were assigned to accompany him Elder Kimball s response was remarkable The idea of being appointed to such an important mission was almost more than I could bear I was nearly ready to sink under the burden which was placed upon me 18 Nevertheless he undertook the mission with absolute faith commitment and humility Sometimes humility is accepting callings when we do not feel adequate Sometimes humility is serving faithfully when we feel capable of a more high profile assignment Humble leaders have verbally and by example established that it is not where we serve but how we faithfully serve 19 Sometimes humility is overcoming hurt feelings when we feel that leaders or others have mistreated us On July 23 1837 the Prophet Joseph met with Elder Thomas B Marsh President of the Quorum of the Twelve Elder Marsh was apparently frustrated that the Prophet had called two members of his quorum to go to England without consulting him As Joseph met with Elder Marsh any hurt feelings were put aside and the Prophet received a remarkable revelation It is now the 112th section of the Doctrine and Covenants 20 It gives incredible direction from heaven with respect to humility and missionary work Verse 10 reads Be thou humble and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers 21This revelation occurred the exact same day that Elders Kimball Hyde and John Goodson full of humility were declaring the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the Vauxhall Chapel in Preston England 22 This was the first time missionaries had proclaimed the restored gospel outside of North America in this dispensation Their missionary effort resulted in almost immediate convert baptisms and led to numerous faithful members 23Subsequent parts of the revelation guide the missionary effort in our day They read in part Whosoever ye shall send in my name shall have power to open the door of my kingdom unto any nation inasmuch as they shall humble themselves before me and abide in my word and hearken to the voice of my Spirit 24The humility that undergirded this incredible missionary effort allowed the Lord to establish His Church in a remarkable way Gratefully we continually see this in the Church today Members including the rising generation give up their time and defer education and employment to serve missions Many senior members leave employment and make other sacrifices in order to serve God in whatever capacity they are called We do not allow personal issues to distract or divert us from accomplishing His purposes 25 Church service requires humility We humbly serve as called with all our might mind and strength At every level of the Church it is important to understand the Christlike attribute of humility Everyday Humility Is Essential in Helping Prepare Individuals to Meet GodThe goal of honoring the Lord and submitting ourselves to His will26 is not as valued in today s society as it has been in the past Some Christian leaders of other faiths believe we are living in a post Christian world 27For generations the religious based virtue of humility and the civic virtues of modesty and understatement have been the predominant standard In today s world there is an increased emphasis on pride self aggrandizement and so called authenticity which sometimes leads to a lack of true humility Some suggest the moral values for happiness today include be real be strong be productive and most important don t rely on other people because your fate is in your own hands 28The scriptures advocate a different approach They suggest that we should be true disciples of Jesus Christ This entails establishing a powerful feeling of accountability to God and a humble approach to life King Benjamin taught that the natural man is an enemy to God and advocated that we need to yield ourselves to the enticings of the Holy Spirit He explained among other things that this requires becoming submissive meek humble patient and full of love 29Some misuse authenticity as a celebration of the natural man and qualities that are the opposite of humility kindness mercy forgiveness and civility We can celebrate our individual uniqueness as children of God without using authenticity as an excuse for un Christlike behavior In our quest for humility the modern internet creates challenges to avoiding pride Two examples are the self indulgent look at me approach or attacking others by ranting on social media One more example is the humblebrag It is defined as an ostensibly modest or self deprecating statement or picture whose actual purpose is to draw attention to something of which one is proud 30 The prophets have always warned about pride and emphasizing the vain things of the world 31The widespread deterioration of civil discourse is also a concern The eternal principle of agency requires that we respect many choices with which we do not agree Conflict and contention now often breach the boundaries of common decency 32 We need more modesty and humility Alma cautions against being puffed up in the pride of your hearts supposing that ye are better one than another and persecuting the humble who walk after the holy order of God 33I have found a genuine goodness among people of all faiths who are humble and feel accountable to God Many of them subscribe to the Old Testament prophet Micah who declared What doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God 34When we are truly humble we pray for forgiveness and forgive others As we read in Mosiah Alma taught that as often as we repent the Lord will forgive our trespasses 35 On the other hand as indicated in the Lord s Prayer 36 when we do not forgive others trespasses we bring ourselves under condemnation 37 Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ through repentance our sins are forgiven When we do not forgive those who trespass against us we are in effect rejecting the Savior s Atonement Holding a grudge and refusing to forgive and refusing to humbly approach our relationships in a Christlike manner truly brings us under condemnation Holding a grudge is poisonous to our souls 38Let me also caution against any form of arrogance The Lord through the prophet Moroni makes a stark contrast between the arrogant and the humble Fools mock but they shall mourn and my grace is sufficient for the meek The Lord further declared I give unto men weakness that they may be humble and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me for if they humble themselves before me and have faith in me then will I make weak things become strong unto them 39Humility also includes being grateful for our numerous blessings and divine assistance Humility isn t some grand identifiable achievement or even overcoming some major challenge It is a sign of spiritual strength It is having the quiet confidence that day by day and hour by hour we can rely on the Lord serve Him and achieve His purposes It is my prayer that in this contentious world we will continuously strive for true humility every day A favorite poem puts it this way The test of greatness is the wayOne meets the eternal Everyday 40I bear a sure witness of the Savior and His Atonement and the overwhelming importance of humbly serving Him each and every day In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
This has been a magnificent general conference We have truly been edified If there is one preeminent objective of general conference it is to build faith in God the Father and our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ My remarks address the foundations of that faith Personal foundations like many worthwhile pursuits are usually built slowly one layer one experience one challenge one setback and one success at a time A most cherished physical experience is a baby s first steps It is magnificent to behold The precious look on the face a combination of determination joy surprise and accomplishment is truly a seminal event In our family there is one event of a similar nature that stands out When our youngest son was about four years old he came into the house and gleefully announced to the family with great pride I can do everything now I can tie I can ride and I can zip We understood he was telling us that he could tie his shoes he could ride his Big Wheel tricycle and he could zip his coat We all laughed but realized that for him they were monumental achievements He thought he had truly arrived and was grown up Physical mental and spiritual development have much in common Physical development is fairly easy to see We begin with baby steps and progress day by day year by year growing and developing to attain our ultimate physical stature Development is different for each person When we watch a great athletic or musical performance we often say that the person is very gifted which is usually true But the performance is based upon years of preparation and practice One well known writer Malcolm Gladwell has called this the 10 000 hour rule Researchers have determined that this amount of practice is necessary in athletics musical performance academic proficiency specialized work skills medical or legal expertise and so on One of these research experts asserts that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world class expert in anything 1Most people recognize that to obtain peak physical and mental performance such preparation and practice are essential Unfortunately in an increasingly secular world less emphasis is placed on the amount of spiritual growth necessary to become more Christlike and establish the foundations that lead to enduring faith We tend to emphasize moments of sublime spiritual understanding These are precious instances when we know the Holy Ghost has witnessed special spiritual insights to our hearts and minds We rejoice in these events they should not be diminished in any way But for enduring faith and to have the constant companionship of the Spirit there is no substitute for the individual religious observance that is comparable to physical and mental development We should build on these experiences which sometimes resemble initial baby steps We do this by consecrated commitment to sacred sacrament meetings scripture study prayer and serving as called In one recent obituary tribute for the father of 13 children it was reported his loyalty to daily prayer and scripture study profoundly influenced his children giving them an immovable foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ 2An experience I had when I was 15 years old was foundational for me My faithful mother had valiantly tried to help me establish the foundations of faith in my life I attended sacrament meeting Primary then Young Men and seminary I had read the Book of Mormon and had always prayed individually At that time a dramatic event occurred in our family when my beloved older brother was considering a potential mission call My wonderful father a less active Church member wanted him to continue his education and not serve a mission This became a point of contention In a remarkable discussion with my brother who was five years older and led the discussion we concluded that his decision on whether to serve a mission depended on three issues 1 Was Jesus Christ divine 2 Was the Book of Mormon true 3 Was Joseph Smith the prophet of the Restoration As I prayed sincerely that night the Spirit confirmed to me the truth of all three questions I also came to understand that almost every decision I would make for the rest of my life would be based on the answers to those three questions I particularly realized that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ was essential In looking back I recognize that primarily because of my mother the foundations were in place for me to receive the spiritual confirmation that evening My brother who already had a testimony made the decision to serve a mission and ultimately won our father s support Spiritual guidance is received when needed in the Lord s time and according to His will 3 The Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ is an excellent example I recently viewed a first edition of the Book of Mormon Joseph Smith completed the translation when he was 23 years old We know something of the process and instruments he used in that translation In that first 1830 printing Joseph included a short preface and simply and clearly declared it was translated by the gift and power of God 4 What about the aids to translation the Urim and Thummim the seer stones Were they essential or were they like the training wheels on a bicycle until Joseph could exercise the faith necessary to receive more direct revelation 5Just as repetition and consistent effort are required to gain physical or mental capacity the same is true in spiritual matters Remember that the Prophet Joseph received the same visitor Moroni with exactly the same message four times in preparation for receiving the plates I believe that weekly participation in sacred sacrament meetings has spiritual implications we do not fully understand Pondering the scriptures regularly rather than reading them occasionally can substitute a superficial understanding for a sublime life changing enhancement of our faith Faith is a principle of power Let me illustrate When I was a young missionary a great mission president6 introduced me in a profound way to the scriptural account found in Luke 8 of the woman who had an issue of blood for 12 years and had spent everything she had on physicians who could not heal her It has remained to this day one of my favorite scriptures You will remember that she had faith that if she could but touch the border of the Savior s garment she would be healed When she did so she was healed immediately The Savior who was walking along with His disciples said Who touched me Peter s answer was that all of them walking together were pressing against Him And Jesus said Somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me The root word for virtue could easily be interpreted as power In Spanish and Portuguese it is translated as power But regardless the Savior did not see her He had not focused on her need But her faith was such that touching the border of the garment drew upon the healing power of the Son of God As the Savior said to her Daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace 7I have contemplated this account all my adult life I realize that our personal prayers and supplications to a loving Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ can bring blessings into our lives beyond our ability to comprehend The foundations of faith the kind of faith that this woman demonstrated should be the great desire of our hearts However initial foundations of faith even with spiritual confirmation do not mean that we will not face challenges Conversion to the gospel does not mean all our problems will be solved Early Church history and recorded revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants contain excellent examples of establishing foundations of faith and dealing with the vicissitudes and challenges that everyone faces The completion of the Kirtland Temple was foundational for the entire Church It was accompanied by spiritual outpourings doctrinal revelations and restoration of essential keys for the continuing establishment of the Church Like the ancient Apostles on the day of Pentecost many members experienced marvelous spiritual experiences in connection with the dedication of the Kirtland Temple 8 But as in our own lives this did not mean they wouldn t face challenges or hardships going forward Little did these early members know they would be faced with a United States financial crisis the panic of 1837 that would test their very souls 9One example of the challenges related to this financial crisis was experienced by Elder Parley P Pratt one of the great leaders of the Restoration He was an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In the early part of 1837 his dear wife Thankful died after delivering their first child Parley and Thankful had been married almost 10 years and her death devastated him A few months later Elder Pratt found himself in one of the most difficult times the Church has experienced In the midst of the national crisis local economic issues including land speculation and the struggles of a financial institution founded by Joseph Smith and other Church members created discord and contention in Kirtland Church leaders did not always make wise temporal decisions in their own lives Parley suffered significant financial losses and for a time became disaffected with the Prophet Joseph 10 He wrote a stinging criticism to Joseph and spoke in opposition of him from the pulpit At the same time Parley said he continued to believe in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants 11Elder Pratt had lost his wife his land and his home Parley without telling Joseph left for Missouri On the road there he unexpectedly met fellow Apostles Thomas B Marsh and David Patten returning to Kirtland They felt a great need to have harmony restored to the Quorum and persuaded Parley to return with them He realized that no one had lost more than Joseph Smith and his family Parley sought out the Prophet wept and confessed that what he had done was wrong In the months after his wife Thankful s death Parley had been under a dark cloud and had been overcome by fears and frustrations 12 Joseph knowing what it was like to struggle against opposition and temptation frankly forgave Parley praying for him and blessing him 13 Parley and others who remained faithful benefited from the Kirtland challenges They increased in wisdom and became more noble and virtuous The experience became part of their foundations of faith Adversity should not be viewed as either disfavor from the Lord or a withdrawal of His blessings Opposition in all things is part of the refiner s fire to prepare us for an eternal celestial destiny 14 When the Prophet Joseph was in Liberty Jail the words of the Lord to him described all manner of challenges including tribulations and false accusations and conclude If the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee know thou my son that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good The Son of Man hath descended below them all Art thou greater than he 15The Lord in this instruction to Joseph Smith also made it clear that his days were known and would not be numbered less The Lord concluded Fear not what man can do for God shall be with you forever and ever 16What then are the blessings of faith What does faith accomplish The list is almost endless Our sins can be forgiven because of faith in Christ 17As many as have faith have communion with the Holy Spirit 18Salvation comes through faith on Christ s name 19We receive strength according to our faith in Christ 20None enter the Lord s rest save those who wash their garments in Christ s blood because of their faith 21Prayers are answered according to faith 22Without faith among men God can do no miracle among them 23In the end our faith in Jesus Christ is the essential foundation for our eternal salvation and exaltation As Helaman taught his sons Remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer who is Christ the Son of God that ye must build your foundation which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall 24I am grateful for the fortification of the foundations of faith that has come from this conference My plea is that we will make the sacrifices and have the humility necessary to strengthen the foundations of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ Of Him I bear my sure witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Eternal life is the greatest gift of God and is bestowed on those who keep God s commandments and endure to the end 1 On the other hand eternal life with our Heavenly Father is denied those who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus 2 There are a number of stumbling blocks to our valor that can prevent us from reaching the goal of eternal life 3 Stumbling blocks can be complex let me illustrate Many years ago my father built a small cabin on part of the ranch property where he had been raised The vistas across the meadows were exceptional When the walls were framed in for the cabin I made a visit I was surprised that the window with the view focused directly on a power pole that was a short distance from the house To me it was a huge distraction from the magnificent view I said Dad why did you let them put the power pole directly in front of your view from the window My father an exceptionally practical and calm man exclaimed with some emotion Quentin that power pole is the most beautiful thing to me on the entire ranch He then made his case When I look at that pole I realize that unlike when I grew up here I will not have to carry water in containers from the spring up to the house to cook wash my hands or bathe I will not have to light candles or oil lamps at night to read I want to see that power pole right in the middle of the view window My father had a different perspective on the power pole than I did To him that pole represented an improved life but to me it was a stumbling block to a magnificent vista My dad valued power light and cleanliness above an aesthetic view I immediately realized that while the pole was a stumbling block for me it had great practical symbolic meaning to my father A stumbling block is an impediment to belief or understanding or an obstacle to progress 4 To stumble spiritually is to fall into sin or waywardness 5 A stumbling block can be anything that distracts us from achieving righteous goals We cannot afford to have our testimonies of the Father and the Son become confused and complicated by stumbling blocks We cannot fall into that trap Our testimonies of Them need to remain pure and simple like my father s simple defense of the power pole on the ranch where he grew up What are some of the stumbling blocks that confuse and complicate our pure and simple testimony of the Father and the Son and keep us from being valiant in that testimony One Stumbling Block Is the Philosophies of MenWe are committed to knowledge of every kind and believe the glory of God is intelligence 6 But we also know that the preferred strategy of the adversary is to lead people away from God and cause them to stumble by emphasizing the philosophies of men over the Savior and His teachings The Apostle Paul was a sure witness of Jesus Christ because of a miraculous and life changing experience with the Savior 7 Paul s unique background prepared him to relate to people of many cultures He loved the frank simplicity of the Thessalonians and the tender sympathy of the Philippians 8 He initially found it more difficult to relate to the intellectual and sophisticated Greeks In Athens on Mars Hill he attempted a philosophical approach and was rejected To the Corinthians he determined to simply teach the doctrine of Christ crucified 9 To use the Apostle Paul s own words And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man s wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God 10Some of the most magnificent scriptural accounts of the Savior and His mission are set forth in 1 Corinthians One chapter 15 has received worldwide attention through performances of George Frideric Handel s Messiah 11 It contains profound doctrine about the Savior In the third part of Messiah immediately following the Hallelujah Chorus most of the scriptures used are from 1 Corinthians 15 In a few of these verses Paul beautifully describes some of what the Savior accomplished For now is Christ risen from the dead the firstfruits of them that slept Since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead For as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive O death where is thy sting O grave where is thy victory But thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ 12We know the Apostasy occurred in part because the philosophies of men were elevated over Christ s basic essential doctrine Instead of the simplicity of the Savior s message being taught many plain and precious truths were changed or lost In fact Christianity adopted some Greek philosophical traditions to reconcile people s beliefs with their existing culture The historian Will Durant wrote Christianity did not destroy paganism it adopted it The Greek mind dying came to a transmigrated life 13 Historically and in our own day some people reject the gospel of Jesus Christ because in their view it doesn t have adequate intellectual sophistication At the dawn of the Restoration many at least professed to follow the Savior s teachings Many countries considered themselves Christian nations But even then there was prophecy of a more difficult time for our day Heber C Kimball was one of the original Twelve Apostles of this dispensation and First Counselor to President Brigham Young He warned The time is coming when it will be difficult to tell the face of a Saint from the face of an enemy to the people of God Then look out for the great sieve for there will be a great sifting time and many will fall He concluded that there is a TEST coming 14In our day the influence of Christianity in many countries including the United States is significantly reduced Without religious beliefs there is no feeling of accountability to God Accordingly it is hard to establish universal values about how to live Philosophies which are deeply held often conflict with each other Unfortunately this also happens with some members of the Church who lose their bearings and become influenced by the cause of the moment many of which are clearly not righteous In line with Heber C Kimball s prophecy Elder Neal A Maxwell said in 1982 Much sifting will occur because of lapses in righteous behavior which go unrepented of A few will give up instead of holding out to the end A few will be deceived by defectors Likewise others will be offended for sufficient unto each dispensation are the stumbling blocks thereof 15Another Stumbling Block Is Refusing to See Sin in Its True LightOne of the unique and troubling aspects of our day is that many people engage in sinful conduct but refuse to consider it sinful They have no remorse or willingness to acknowledge their conduct as being morally wrong Even some who profess a belief in the Father and the Son wrongfully take the position that a loving Father in Heaven should exact no consequences for conduct that is contrary to His commandments This was apparently the position taken by Corianton the son of Alma the Younger in the Book of Mormon He had engaged in grievous immoral conduct and was being counseled by Alma We are blessed that the great prophet Alma who had personally experienced the darkest abyss and the marvelous light 16 recorded the instruction he gave In the 39th chapter of Alma we read how he counseled this son through the repentance process and then explained how Christ would come to take away sin He made the necessity of repentance clear to Corianton because no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God 17Alma 42 contains some of the most magnificent doctrine on the Atonement in all scripture Alma helped Corianton understand that it is not an injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery 18 But he noted that starting with Adam a merciful God had provided a space for repentance because without repentance the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated 19 Alma also established that God s plan is a plan of happiness 20Alma s teachings are most instructive For behold justice exerciseth all his demands and also mercy claimeth all which is her own and thus none but the truly penitent are saved 21 Seen in their true light the glorious blessings of repentance and adherence to the Savior s teachings are monumentally important It is not unfair to be clear as Alma was with Corianton about the consequences of sinful choices and lack of repentance It has often been declared Sooner or later everybody has to sit down to a banquet of consequences 22The remarkable and celestial blessing of the Savior s Atonement is that through repentance sinful conduct is blotted out After Corianton s repentance Alma concluded Let these things trouble you no more and only let your sins trouble you with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance 23Looking beyond the Mark Is a Stumbling BlockThe prophet Jacob referred to ancient Jews as a stiffnecked people who despised plainness killed the prophets and sought for things that they could not understand Wherefore because of their blindness which blindness came by looking beyond the mark they must needs fall 24While there are many examples of looking beyond the mark 25 a significant one in our day is extremism Gospel extremism is when one elevates any gospel principle above other equally important principles and takes a position that is beyond or contrary to the teachings of Church leaders One example is when one advocates for additions changes or primary emphasis to one part of the Word of Wisdom Another is expensive preparation for end of days scenarios In both examples others are encouraged to accept private interpretations If we turn a health law or any other principle into a form of religious fanaticism we are looking beyond the mark 26Speaking of important doctrine the Lord has declared Whosoever declareth more or less than this the same is not of me 27 When we elevate any principle in a way that lessens our commitment to other equally important principles or take a position contrary to or which exceeds teachings of Church leaders we are looking beyond the mark In addition some members elevate causes many of which are good to a status superior to basic gospel doctrine They substitute their devotion to the cause as their first commitment and relegate their commitment to the Savior and His teachings to a secondary position If we elevate anything above our devotion to the Savior if our conduct recognizes Him as just another teacher and not the divine Son of God then we are looking beyond the mark Jesus Christ is the mark The 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants makes it clear that being valiant in the testimony of Jesus 28 is the simple essential test between those who will inherit the blessings of the celestial kingdom and those in the lesser terrestrial kingdom To be valiant we need to focus on the power of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice to overcome death and through our repentance to cleanse us from sin and we need to follow the doctrine of Christ 29 We also need the light and knowledge of the Savior s life and teachings to guide us on the covenant pathway including the sacred ordinances of the temple We must be steadfast in Christ feast upon His word and endure to the end 30ConclusionIf we are to be valiant in our testimony of Jesus we must avoid the stumbling blocks that entrap and impede the progress of many otherwise honorable men and women Let us determine to always be in His service While seeking knowledge we need to avoid the philosophies of men that lessen our commitment to the Savior We must see sin in its true light and accept the Savior s Atonement through repentance We need to avoid looking beyond the mark and focus on Jesus Christ our Savior and Redeemer and follow His doctrine My father saw the pole as a means of providing power light and abundant water for cooking and cleansing It was a stepping stone to improving his life One writer suggests that stumbling blocks may be made into stepping stones to a noble character and to Heaven 31For us being valiant in our testimony of Jesus is a stepping stone toward qualifying for the Savior s grace and the celestial kingdom Jesus Christ is the only name under heaven by which we may be saved 32 I bear my sure witness of both His divinity and His supernal role in the Father s plan In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The rolling forth of the Lord s plan of salvation during this dispensation of the fulness of times is almost beyond comprehension 1 This is exemplified by President Thomas S Monson s announcement of 4 new temples in this conference session When President Monson was called as an Apostle in 1963 there were 12 operating temples in the world 2 With the dedication of the Provo City Center Temple there are now 150 and there will be 177 when all announced temples are dedicated This is cause for us to humbly rejoice One hundred eighty years ago on this very day April 3 1836 a magnificent vision was opened to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple This occurred just one week after the dedication of that temple In this vision they saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit in the temple Among other things the Savior declared Let the hearts of all my people rejoice who have with their might built this house to my name For behold I have accepted this house and my name shall be here and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house 3On that sacred occasion ancient prophets appeared including Elijah who bestowed the keys essential for temple ordinances We have some sense of the rejoicing that is going on in Quito Ecuador Harare Zimbabwe Bel m Brazil and Lima Peru both with members and missionaries based on what happened in Bangkok Thailand a year ago when that temple was announced Sister Shelly Senior wife of the then president of the Thailand Bangkok Mission David Senior emailed family and friends to say that after she and her husband had listened to President Monson announce that temple there had been 12 sleepless hours and lots of tears of happiness They called their mission assistants at 11 30 p m and informed them The assistants called all the missionaries The report came back that the whole mission was awake in the middle of the night jumping on their beds Sister Senior humorously admonished family and friends Please don t tell the Missionary Department 4The deep spiritual response of the members in Thailand was equally strong I am confident there have been spiritual preparations in hearts and homes and manifestations from heaven preparing the Saints where these newly announced temples will be located Sister Senior in Thailand had some special hand mirrors made for her personal teaching especially with sisters There was a temple etched in the mirror with the wording See Yourself in the Temple As people gazed into the mirror they saw themselves in the temple The Seniors taught the investigators and members to picture themselves in the temple and make the necessary lifestyle changes and spiritual preparations to meet this goal My challenge this morning is for each of us wherever we live to see ourselves in the temple President Monson has stated Until you have entered the house of the Lord and have received all the blessings which await you there you have not obtained everything the Church has to offer The all important and crowning blessings of membership in the Church are those blessings which we receive in the temples of God 5Despite the lack of righteousness in the world today we live in a sacred holy time Prophets with loving and longing hearts have described our day for centuries 6The Prophet Joseph Smith citing both Obadiah7 in the Old Testament and 1 Peter8 in the New Testament acknowledged the great purpose of God in providing baptism for the dead and allowing us to be saviors on Mount Zion 9The Lord has prospered our people and provided the resources and prophetic guidance so we can be valiant in attending to our temple responsibilities for both the living and the dead Because of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ we understand the purpose of life the Father s plan of salvation for His children the Savior s redemptive sacrifice and the central role of families in the organization of heaven 10The combination of increased numbers of temples and advanced technology to fulfill our sacred family history responsibilities for our ancestors makes this the most blessed time in all history I rejoice in the extraordinary faithfulness of our youth in indexing and finding their ancestors and then doing the baptism and confirmation work in the temple You are literally among the prophesied saviors on Mount Zion How Do We Prepare for the Temple We know that righteousness and sanctification are essential parts of preparing for the temple In Doctrine and Covenants section 97 it reads And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it that it be not defiled my glory shall rest upon it 11Until 1891 the President of the Church signed each temple recommend to protect the sanctity of the temple That responsibility was then delegated to bishops and stake presidents It is our great desire that members of the Church will live to be worthy of a temple recommend Please don t see the temple as some distant and perhaps unachievable goal Working with their bishop most members can achieve all righteous requirements in a relatively short period of time if they have a determination to qualify and fully repent of transgressions This includes being willing to forgive ourselves and not focus on our imperfections or sins as disqualifying us from ever entering a sacred temple The Savior s Atonement was accomplished for all of God s children His redeeming sacrifice satisfies the demands of justice for all those who truly repent The scriptures describe this in a most beautiful fashion Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow 12 And I will remember them no more 13We assure you that living righteous principles will bring you and your family happiness fulfillment and peace 14 Members both adults and youth 15 self certify their worthiness when they answer the temple recommend questions The essential requirement is to increase our testimony of God the Father His Son Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His gospel and to experience the ministering of the Holy Ghost The Blessings of the Temple Are NumerousThe primary blessings of the temple are the ordinances of exaltation The gospel plan is about exaltation and encompasses making and keeping sacred covenants with God Except for baptism and confirmation these ordinances and covenants are performed and received in the temple for the living For the dead all the saving ordinances and covenants are received in the temple Brigham Young taught There is not one thing that the Lord could do for the salvation of the human family that he has neglected to do all that can be accomplished for their salvation independent of them has been accomplished in and by the Savior 16Church leaders organize stakes wards quorums Church auxiliaries missions and so forth in our chapels and other buildings The Lord organizes eternal families only in temples It is clear that those with broken hearts and contrite spirits who have truly repented of their sins are completely acceptable to the Lord in His holy house 17 We know God is no respecter of persons 18 One of the precious things I love about the temple is that among those who attend there are no distinctions of wealth rank or position of any kind We are all equal before God Everyone is dressed in white to signify we are a pure and righteous people 19 All sit side by side with a desire in their hearts to be worthy sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father Just think across the entire world women and men can through sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples return to the presence of God and be united eternally 20 They do this in a beautiful sacred sealing room available to all temple worthy members After they enter into these covenants they can see themselves in the temple mirrors that face each other Together the temple mirrors reflect back and forth images that stretch seemingly into eternity 21 These reflected images help us contemplate parents grandparents and all previous generations They help us recognize the sacred covenants that connect us to all generations that follow This is incredibly significant and it starts when you see yourself in the temple President Howard W Hunter counseled us to consider the majestic teachings in the great dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple a prayer the Prophet Joseph Smith said was given to him by revelation It is a prayer that continues to be answered upon us individually upon us as families and upon us as a people because of the priesthood power the Lord has given us to use in His holy temples 22 We would do well to study the 109th section of the Doctrine and Covenants and to follow President Hunter s admonition to establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of our membership 23The temple is also a place of refuge thanksgiving instruction and understanding that we may be perfected in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth 24 Throughout my life it has been a place of tranquility and peace in a world that is literally in commotion 25 It is wonderful to leave the cares of the world behind in that sacred setting Often in the temple and as we engage in family history research we feel promptings and have impressions from the Holy Ghost 26 Occasionally in the temple the veil between us and those on the other side becomes very thin We get additional assistance in our efforts to be saviors on Mount Zion Several years ago in a temple in Central America the wife of one of our now emeritus General Authorities assisted a father a mother and their children in receiving eternal covenants in the sealing room where the temple mirrors are located As they concluded and faced those mirrors she noticed there was a face in the mirror that was not in the room She inquired of the mother and learned that a daughter had passed away and accordingly was not physically present The deceased daughter was then included by proxy in the sacred ordinance 27 Never underestimate the assistance provided in temples from the other side of the veil Please know how earnestly we desire that everyone make any necessary changes to qualify for the temple Prayerfully review where you are in your life seek the guidance of the Spirit and talk to your bishop about preparing yourself for the temple President Thomas S Monson has said There is no more important goal for you to work toward than being worthy to go to the temple 28The Savior Is the Chief Immovable Cornerstone of Our Faith and His Church I was privileged to participate with President Henry B Eyring at the rededication of the Suva Fiji Temple two months ago It was a special sacred occasion President Eyring s courage and strong spiritual impressions allowed the rededication to proceed in the face of the worst cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere Physical and spiritual protections were provided to youth missionaries and members 29 The hand of the Lord was clearly evident The Suva Fiji Temple rededication was a refuge from the storm Often as we experience the storms of life we witness the Lord s hand in providing eternal protections The original dedication of the Suva Fiji Temple on June 18 2000 was also remarkable As the temple neared completion members of parliament were taken hostage by a group of rebels Downtown Suva Fiji was looted and burned The military declared martial law As the Area President I went with the four stake presidents in Fiji and met the military leaders at the Queen Elizabeth barracks After we explained the proposed dedication they were supportive but concerned about the safety of President Gordon B Hinckley They recommended a small dedication with no events outside the temple like the cornerstone ceremony They emphasized that anyone outside the temple could be a potential target for violence President Hinckley approved one small dedicatory session with just the new temple presidency and a few local leaders no others were invited because of the danger However he emphatically stated If we do dedicate the temple we will have the cornerstone ceremony because Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone and this is His Church When we actually went outside for the cornerstone ceremony there were no nonmembers children media or others present But a faithful prophet demonstrated his courageous and unwavering commitment to the Savior Later President Hinckley speaking of the Savior said There is none to equal Him There never has been There never will be Thanks be to God for the gift of His Beloved Son who gave His life that we might live and who is the chief immovable cornerstone of our faith and His Church 30Brothers and sisters I pray that each of us will honor the Savior and make any necessary changes to see ourselves in His sacred temples In doing so we can accomplish His holy purposes and prepare ourselves and our families for all the blessings the Lord and His Church can bestow in this life and eternity I bear my sure witness that the Savior lives In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
The prophet Lehi declared If there be no righteousness there be no happiness 1The adversary has been successful in planting a great myth in the minds of many people He and his emissaries declare that the real choice we have is between happiness and pleasure now in this life and happiness in a life to come which the adversary asserts may not exist This myth is a false choice but it is very seductive 2The ultimate noble purpose of God s plan of happiness is for righteous disciples and covenant families to be united in love harmony and peace in this life3 and attain celestial glory in the eternities with God the Father our Creator and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ our Savior 4When I was a young missionary assigned to the British Mission my first area of labor was in what was then the Bristol District One of the local Church leaders emphasized that missionaries serving in that area needed to be shipshape and Bristol fashion Initially I didn t understand the point he was making I soon learned the history and meaning of the nautical phrase shipshape and Bristol fashion At one time Bristol was the second busiest port in the United Kingdom It had a very high tidal range of 43 feet 13 m the second highest in the world At low tide when the water receded the old ships would hit bottom and fall on their sides and if the ships were not well built they would be damaged In addition everything that was not carefully stowed away or tied down would be thrown in a chaotic fashion and ruined or spoiled 5 After I understood what that phrase meant it was clear that this leader was telling us that as missionaries we must be righteous follow rules and be prepared for difficult situations This same challenge is applicable to each of us I would describe being shipshape and Bristol fashion as being temple worthy in good times and in bad times While the fluctuation of the tide in the Bristol Channel is somewhat predictable and can be prepared for the storms and temptations of this life are often unpredictable But this we know they will come In order to overcome the challenges and temptations that each of us inevitably faces it will require righteous preparation and the use of divinely provided protections We must determine to be temple worthy regardless of what befalls us If we are prepared we shall not fear 6Happiness in this life and happiness in the life to come are interconnected by righteousness Even in the period between death and the Resurrection the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness which is called paradise a state of rest a state of peace 7At the commencement of the Savior s earthly ministry in Israel and later among the Nephites the Savior addressed the issue of happiness both in this life and in eternity He stressed ordinances but He also placed great emphasis on moral behavior For example disciples would be blessed if they would hunger and thirst after righteousness be merciful be pure in heart be peacemakers and follow other basic moral principles Clearly our Lord Jesus Christ emphasized as a foundational doctrinal message both righteous attitudes and conduct in day to day living His teachings not only replaced and transcended elements of the law of Moses8 but also were a rejection of the false philosophies of men For many centuries the gospel of Jesus Christ has inspired beliefs and established standards of conduct as to what is righteous desirable and moral and results in happiness felicity and joy However the principles and basic morality the Savior taught are under serious attack in today s world Christianity is under attack Many believe that what is moral has basically changed 9We live in difficult times There is an increased tendency to call evil good and good evil 10 A world that emphasizes self aggrandizement and secularism is cause for great concern One prominent writer not of our faith has put it this way Unfortunately I see little evidence that people are actually happier in the emerging dispensation or that their children are better off or that the cause of social justice is well served or that declining marriage rates and thinning family trees promise anything save greater loneliness for the majority and stagnation overall 11As disciples of the Savior we are expected to plan and prepare In the plan of happiness moral agency is a central organizing principle and our choices matter 12 The Savior emphasized this throughout His ministry including in His parables of the foolish virgins and the talents 13 In each of these the Lord commended preparation and action and condemned procrastination and idleness I recognize that despite the overwhelming happiness embodied in God s divine plan sometimes it can feel far away and disconnected from our current circumstances It may feel beyond our reach as struggling disciples From our limited perspective current temptations and distractions can seem attractive The rewards for resisting those temptations on the other hand can feel distant and unattainable But a true understanding of the Father s plan reveals that the rewards of righteousness are available right now Wickedness such as immoral conduct is never part of the answer Alma said it clearly to his son Corianton Behold I say unto you wickedness never was happiness 14Our doctrine is clearly stated by Amulek in Alma 34 32 Behold this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God yea behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors How then do we prepare in such a difficult time In addition to being temple worthy there are many principles that contribute to righteousness I will emphasize three First Righteous Self Control and ConductI believe that sometimes our loving Father in Heaven must view us with the amusement we feel when we watch our own small children as they learn and grow We all stumble and fall as we gain experience I appreciated the conference address President Dieter F Uchtdorf gave in 201015 about the famous marshmallow experiment conducted at Stanford University in the 1960s You will remember that four year olds were given a single marshmallow If they could wait for 15 or 20 minutes without eating it they would receive a second marshmallow Videos have been produced showing the contortions that many children used to avoid eating the marshmallow Some did not succeed 16Last year the professor who conducted the original experiment Dr Walter Mischel wrote a book in which he said the study grew in part out of his concerns about self control and his own addiction to smoking He was particularly concerned after the U S Surgeon General s report of 1964 concluded that smoking caused lung cancer 17 After years of study one of his professional colleagues reported that self control is like a muscle the more you use it the stronger it gets Avoiding something tempting once will help you develop the ability to resist other temptations in the future 18A principle of eternal progression is that exercising self control and living righteously strengthen our ability to resist temptation This is true both in the spiritual realm and in temporal matters Our missionaries are an excellent example They develop Christlike attributes and emphasize obedience and spirituality They are expected to adhere to a rigorous schedule and spend their days in the service of others They have a modest conservative appearance instead of the casual or immodest manner of dress so prevalent today Their conduct and appearance convey a moral serious message 19We have approximately 230 000 young people who are currently serving as missionaries or who have returned from missionary service in the last five years They have developed remarkable spiritual strength and self discipline that need to be continually exercised or these qualities will atrophy just like muscles that are not used All of us need to develop and demonstrate conduct and appearance that declare we are true followers of Christ Those who abandon either righteous conduct or a wholesome modest appearance expose themselves to lifestyles that bring neither joy nor happiness The restored gospel gives us the blueprint of the plan of happiness and an incentive to understand and exercise self control and avoid temptation It also teaches us how to repent when violations have occurred Second Honoring the Sabbath Will Increase Righteousness and Be a Protection for the FamilyThe early Christian Church changed observance of the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday to commemorate the Lord s Resurrection Other basic sacred purposes of the Sabbath remained unchanged For Jews and Christians the Sabbath symbolizes the mighty works of God 20My wife and I and two of my colleagues and their wives recently participated in a Jewish Shabbat Sabbath at the invitation of a dear friend Robert Abrams and his wife Diane in their New York home 21 It commenced at the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath on a Friday evening The focus was honoring God as the Creator It began by blessing the family and singing a Sabbath hymn 22 We joined in the ceremonial washing of hands the blessing of the bread the prayers the kosher meal the recitation of scripture and singing Sabbath songs in a celebratory mood We listened to the Hebrew words following along with English translations The most poignant scriptures read from the Old Testament which are also dear to us were from Isaiah declaring the Sabbath a delight 23 and from Ezekiel that the Sabbath shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that I am the Lord your God 24The overwhelming impression from this wonderful evening was of family love devotion and accountability to God As I thought about this event I reflected on the extreme persecution that the Jews have experienced over centuries Clearly honoring the Sabbath has been a perpetual covenant preserving and blessing the Jewish people in fulfillment of scripture 25 It has also contributed to the extraordinary family life and happiness that are evident in the lives of many Jewish people 26For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints honoring the Sabbath is a form of righteousness that will bless and strengthen families connect us with our Creator and increase happiness The Sabbath can help separate us from that which is frivolous inappropriate or immoral It allows us to be in the world but not of the world In the last six months a most remarkable change has occurred in the Church This has been in the response of the members to renewed emphasis on the Sabbath by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve and to President Russell M Nelson s challenge to make the Sabbath a delight 27 Many members understand that truly keeping the Sabbath day holy is a refuge from the storms of this life It is also a sign of our devotion to our Father in Heaven and an increased understanding of the sacredness of sacrament meeting Still we have a long way to go but we have a wonderful beginning I challenge all of us to continue to embrace this counsel and improve our Sabbath worship Third Divine Protections Are Provided When We Are RighteousAs part of God s divine plan we are blessed with the gift of the Holy Ghost This gift is the right to have whenever one is worthy the companionship of the Holy Ghost 28 This member of the Godhead serves as a cleansing agent if the gospel is first in our lives He also is a voice of warning against evil and a voice of protection against danger As we navigate the seas of life following the impressions of the Holy Ghost is essential The Spirit will help us avoid temptations and dangers and comfort and lead us through challenges The fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith 29Adherence to sacred gospel principles will allow us to be temple worthy enable us to find happiness in this life and lead us back to our heavenly home My dear brothers and sisters life is not easy nor was it meant to be It is a time of testing and trial Like the old ships in Bristol Harbor there will be times when the tide goes out and it seems as if everything in this world keeping us afloat disappears We may hit the bottom and even be tipped over on our sides Amid such trials I promise you that living and maintaining temple worthy lives will hold together all that really matters The sweet blessings of peace happiness and joy along with the blessings of eternal life and celestial glory with our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ will be realized I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
In this Easter season we reflect upon and rejoice in the redemption provided by our Savior Jesus Christ 1The clamor that reverberates across the earth because of worldly wickedness creates feelings of vulnerability With modern communication the impact of iniquity inequality and injustice leaves many feeling that life is inherently unfair As significant as these trials can be they must not distract us from rejoicing in and celebrating Christ s supernal intercession in our behalf The Savior literally gained the victory over death With mercy and compassion He took upon Himself our iniquity and transgressions thus redeeming us and satisfying the demands of justice for all who would repent and believe on His name 2His magnificent atoning sacrifice is of transcendent significance beyond mortal comprehension This act of grace provides the peace that surpasses understanding 3How then do we deal with the harsh realities that surround us My wife Mary has always loved sunflowers She rejoices when they in quite improbable places appear on the roadside There is a dirt road that leads to the home where my grandparents lived When we started down that road Mary would often exclaim Do you think we will see those amazing sunflowers today We were surprised that sunflowers flourish in soil which has been impacted by farm and snow removal equipment and the accumulation of materials that would not be considered ideal soil for wildflowers to grow One of the remarkable characteristics of young wild sunflowers in addition to growing in soil that is not hospitable is how the young flower bud follows the sun across the sky In doing so it receives life sustaining energy before bursting forth in its glorious yellow color Like the young sunflower when we follow the Savior of the world the Son of God we flourish and become glorious despite the many terrible circumstances that surround us He truly is our light and life In the parable of the wheat and the tares the Savior declared to His disciples that those who offend and do iniquity shall be gathered out of His kingdom 4 But speaking of the faithful He said Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father 5 As individuals disciples of Christ living in a hostile world that is literally in commotion we can thrive and bloom if we are rooted in our love of the Savior and humbly follow His teachings Our ability to stand firm and true and follow the Savior despite the vicissitudes of life is greatly strengthened by righteous families and Christ centered unity in our wards and branches 6The Right Time at HomeThe role of the family in God s plan is to bring us happiness to help us learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere and to prepare us for eternal life 7 The beautiful traditions of religious observance in the home need to be embedded in the hearts of our children My uncle Vaughn Roberts Kimball was a good student an aspiring author and a BYU football quarterback On December 8 1941 the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor he enlisted in the U S Navy While on a recruiting assignment in Albany New York he submitted a short article to the Reader s Digest The magazine paid him 200 and published his piece titled The Right Time at Home in the May 1944 issue His contribution to the Reader s Digest where he casts himself as the sailor reads in part The Right Time at Home One evening in Albany New York I asked a sailor what time it was He pulled out a huge watch and replied It s 7 20 I knew it was later Your watch has stopped hasn t it I asked No he said I m still on Mountain Standard Time I m from southern Utah When I joined the Navy Pa gave me this watch He said it d help me remember home When my watch says 5 a m I know Dad is rollin out to milk the cows And any night when it says 7 30 I know the whole family s around a well spread table and Dad s thankin God for what s on it and askin Him to watch over me he concluded I can find out what time it is where I am easy enough What I want to know is what time it is in Utah 8Soon after submitting the article Vaughn was assigned to sea duty in the Pacific theater On May 11 1945 while he was serving on the carrier USS Bunker Hill near Okinawa the ship was bombed by two suicide planes 9 Almost 400 crewmen died including my uncle Vaughn Elder Spencer W Kimball extended his heartfelt sympathy to Vaughn s father noting Vaughn s worthiness and the Lord s assurance that those that die in me shall not taste of death for it shall be sweet unto them 10 Vaughn s father tenderly said that even though Vaughn was buried at sea the hand of God would take Vaughn to his heavenly home 11Twenty eight years later President Spencer W Kimball spoke of Vaughn in general conference He said in part I knew this family well I have knelt in mighty prayer with them Home training has carried through to the eternal blessing of this large family President Kimball challenged every family to be on their knees praying for their sons and daughters twice daily 12Brothers and sisters if we faithfully have family prayer scripture study family home evening priesthood blessings and Sabbath day observance our children will know what time it is at home They will be prepared for an eternal home in heaven regardless of what befalls them in a difficult world It is vitally important that our children know they are loved and safe at home Husbands and wives are equal partners 13 They have different but complementary responsibilities The wife may bear children which blesses the entire family The husband may receive the priesthood which blesses the entire family But in family council wives and husbands as equal partners make the most important decisions They decide how the children will be taught and disciplined how money will be spent where they will live and many other family decisions These are made jointly after seeking guidance from the Lord The goal is an eternal family The Light of Christ plants the eternal nature of the family in the hearts of all God s children One of my favorite writers not of our faith said it this way So much in life is extraneous but the family is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to 14The Church Helps Us Focus on the Savior as a United FamilyIn addition to the family the role of the Church is also significant The Church provides the organization and means for teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to all of God s children It provides the priesthood authority to administer the ordinances of salvation and exaltation to all who are worthy and willing to accept them 15In the world there is rampant contention and iniquity and a major emphasis on divergent cultures and inequality In the Church except for language units our wards and branches are geographical We don t divide by class or rank 16 We rejoice in the fact that all races and cultures are mixed together in a righteous congregation Our ward family is important to our progress happiness and personal effort to be more Christlike Cultures often divide people and are sometimes a source of violence and discrimination 17 In the Book of Mormon some of the most haunting language is used to describe the traditions of wicked fathers which led to violence war evil deeds iniquity and even the destruction of peoples and nations 18There is no better starting point in the scriptures than 4 Nephi for a description of the Church culture that is essential for all of us In verse 2 it reads in part The people were all converted unto the Lord upon all the face of the land both Nephites and Lamanites and there were no contentions and disputations among them and every man did deal justly one with another In verse 16 we read And surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God The fact that there was no contention was attributed to the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people 19 This is the culture to which we aspire Deep cultural values and beliefs go to the core of who we are Traditions of sacrifice gratitude faith and righteousness are to be cherished and preserved Families must relish and protect traditions that build faith 20One of the most significant features of any culture is its language In the San Francisco California area where I lived there were seven nonnative language units Our doctrine with respect to language is set forth in section 90 verse 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants For it shall come to pass in that day that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue and in his own language When God s children pray to Him in their native language that is the language of their heart It is clear that the language of the heart is precious to all people My older brother Joseph is a medical doctor and practiced for many years in the San Francisco Bay area An elderly Samoan Church member who was a new patient came to his office He was in severe debilitating pain It was determined that he had a kidney stone and appropriate treatment was undertaken This faithful member stated that his original goal was merely to understand what was wrong so he could pray in Samoan to his Heavenly Father about his health problem It is important for members to understand the gospel in the language of their heart so they can pray and act in accordance with gospel principles 21Even with diversity of languages and beautiful uplifting cultural traditions we must have hearts knit in unity and love 22 The Lord has stated emphatically Let every man esteem his brother as himself Be one and if ye are not one ye are not mine 23 While we treasure appropriate cultural diversities our goal is to be united in the culture customs and traditions of the gospel of Jesus Christ in every respect The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Has Never Been StrongerWe recognize that some members have questions and concerns as they seek to strengthen their faith and testimonies We should be careful not to be critical or judgmental of those with concerns great or small At the same time those with concerns should do everything they can to build their own faith and testimony Patiently and humbly studying pondering praying living gospel principles and counseling with appropriate leaders are the best ways to resolve questions or concerns Some have asserted that more members are leaving the Church today and that there is more doubt and unbelief than in the past This is simply not true The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has never been stronger The number of members removing their names from the records of the Church has always been very small and is significantly less in recent years than in the past 24 The increase in demonstrably measurable areas such as endowed members with a current temple recommend adult full tithe payers and those serving missions has been dramatic Let me say again the Church has never been stronger But remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God 25 We reach out to everyone If the grim realities you are facing at this time seem dark and heavy and almost unbearable remember that in the soul wrenching darkness of Gethsemane and the incomprehensible torture and pain of Calvary the Savior accomplished the Atonement which resolves the most terrible burdens that can occur in this life He did it for you and He did it for me He did it because He loves us and because He obeys and loves His Father We will be rescued from death even from the depths of the sea Our protections in this life and for eternity will be in individual and family righteousness Church ordinances and following the Savior This is our refuge from the storm For those who feel they are alone you can stand resolutely in righteousness knowing that the Atonement will protect and bless you beyond your ability to fully understand We should remember the Savior keep our covenants and follow the Son of God as the young sunflower follows the sunshine Following His light and example will bring us joy happiness and peace As Psalm 27 and a favorite hymn both proclaim The Lord is my light and my salvation 26On this Easter weekend as one of the Savior s Apostles I bear solemn witness of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ I know He lives I know His voice I testify of His divinity and the reality of the Atonement in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brethren my desire this evening is to share some counsel about decisions and choices When I was a young lawyer in the San Francisco Bay Area our firm did some legal work for the company that produced the Charlie Brown holiday TV specials 1 I became a fan of Charles Schulz and his creation Peanuts with Charlie Brown Lucy Snoopy and other wonderful characters One of my favorite comic strips involved Lucy As I remember it Charlie Brown s baseball team was in an important game Lucy was playing right field and a high fly ball was hit to her The bases were loaded and it was the last of the ninth inning If Lucy caught the ball her team would win If Lucy dropped the ball the other team would win As could happen only in a comic strip the entire team surrounded Lucy as the ball came down Lucy was thinking If I catch the ball I will be the hero if I don t I will be the goat The ball came down and as her teammates eagerly looked on Lucy dropped the ball Charlie Brown threw his glove to the ground in disgust Lucy then looked at her teammates put her hands on her hips and said How do you expect me to catch the ball when I am worried about our country s foreign policy This was one of many fly balls Lucy dropped through the years and she had a new excuse each time 2 While always humorous Lucy s excuses were rationalizations they were untrue reasons for her failure to catch the ball During the ministry of President Thomas S Monson he has often taught that decisions determine destiny 3 In that spirit my counsel tonight is to rise above any rationalizations that prevent us from making righteous decisions especially with respect to serving Jesus Christ In Isaiah we are taught we must refuse the evil and choose the good 4I believe it is of particular importance in our day when Satan is raging in the hearts of men in so many new and subtle ways that our choices and decisions be made carefully consistent with the goals and objectives by which we profess to live We need unequivocal commitment to the commandments and strict adherence to sacred covenants When we allow rationalizations to prevent us from temple endowments worthy missions and temple marriage they are particularly harmful It is heartbreaking when we profess belief in these goals yet neglect the everyday conduct required to achieve them 5Some young people profess their goal is to be married in the temple but do not date temple worthy individuals To be honest some don t even date period You single men the longer you remain single after an appropriate age and maturity the more comfortable you can become But the more uncomfortable you ought to become Please get anxiously engaged 6 in spiritual and social activities compatible with your goal of a temple marriage Some postpone marriage until education is complete and a job obtained While widely accepted in the world this reasoning does not demonstrate faith does not comply with counsel of modern prophets and is not compatible with sound doctrine I recently met a fine teenage young man His goals were to go on a mission obtain an education marry in the temple and have a faithful happy family I was very pleased with his goals But during further conversation it became evident that his conduct and the choices he was making were not consistent with his goals I felt he genuinely wanted to go on a mission and was avoiding serious transgressions that would prohibit a mission but his day to day conduct was not preparing him for the physical emotional social intellectual and spiritual challenges he would face 7 He had not learned to work hard He was not serious about school or seminary He attended church but he had not read the Book of Mormon He was spending a large amount of time on video games and social media He seemed to think that showing up for his mission would be sufficient Young men please recommit to worthy conduct and serious preparation to be emissaries of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ My concern is not only about the big tipping point decisions but also the middle ground the workaday world and seemingly ordinary decisions where we spend most of our time In these areas we need to emphasize moderation balance and especially wisdom It is important to rise above rationalizations and make the best choices A wonderful example of the need for moderation balance and wisdom is the use of the Internet It can be used to do missionary outreach to assist with priesthood responsibilities to find precious ancestors for sacred temple ordinances and much more The potential for good is enormous We also know that it can transmit much that is evil including pornography digital cruelty 8 and anonymous yakking It can also perpetuate foolishness As Brother Randall L Ridd poignantly taught at the last general conference speaking of the Internet You can get caught up in endless loops of triviality that waste your time and degrade your potential 9Distractions and opposition to righteousness are not just on the Internet they are everywhere They affect not just the youth but all of us We live in a world that is literally in commotion 10 We are surrounded by obsessive portrayals of fun and games and immoral and dysfunctional lives These are presented as normal conduct in much of the media Elder David A Bednar recently cautioned members to be authentic in the use of social media 11 A prominent thought leader Arthur C Brooks has emphasized this point He observes that when using social media we tend to broadcast the smiling details of our lives but not the hard times at school or work We portray an incomplete life sometimes in a self aggrandizing or fake way We share this life and then we consume the almost exclusively fake lives of our social media friends Brooks asserts How could it not make you feel worse to spend part of your time pretending to be happier than you are and the other part of your time seeing how much happier others seem to be than you 12Sometimes it feels like we are drowning in frivolous foolishness nonsensical noise and continuous contention When we turn down the volume and examine the substance there is very little that will assist us in our eternal quest toward righteous goals One father wisely responds to his children with their numerous requests to participate in these distractions He simply asks them Will this make you a better person When we rationalize wrong choices big or small which are inconsistent with the restored gospel we lose the blessings and protections we need and often become ensnared in sin or simply lose our way I am particularly concerned with foolishness13 and being obsessed with every new thing In the Church we encourage and celebrate truth and knowledge of every kind But when culture knowledge and social mores are separated from God s plan of happiness and the essential role of Jesus Christ there is an inevitable disintegration of society 14 In our day despite unprecedented gains in many areas especially science and communication essential basic values have eroded and overall happiness and well being have diminished When the Apostle Paul was invited to speak on Mars Hill in Athens he found some of the same intellectual pretension and absence of true wisdom that exist today 15 In Acts we read this account For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing 16 Paul s emphasis was the Resurrection of Jesus Christ When the crowd realized the religious nature of his message some mocked him others essentially dismissed him saying We will hear thee again of this matter 17 Paul left Athens without any success Dean Frederic Farrar wrote of this visit At Athens he founded no church to Athens he wrote no epistle and in Athens often as he passed its neighbourhood he never set foot again 18I believe Elder Dallin H Oaks s inspired message distinguishing between good better best provides an effective way to evaluate choices and priorities 19 Many choices are not inherently evil but if they absorb all of our time and keep us from the best choices then they become insidious Even worthwhile endeavors need evaluation in order to determine if they have become distractions from the best goals I had a memorable discussion with my father when I was a teenager He did not believe enough young people were focused on or preparing for long term important goals like employment and providing for families Meaningful study and preparatory work experience were always at the top of my father s recommended priorities He appreciated that extracurricular activities like debate and student government might have a direct connection with some of my important goals He was less certain about the extensive time I spent participating in football basketball baseball and track He acknowledged that athletics could build strength endurance and teamwork but asserted that perhaps concentrating on one sport for a shorter time would be better In his view sports were good but not the best for me He was concerned that some sports were about building local celebrity or fame at the expense of more important long term goals Given this history one of the reasons I like the account of Lucy playing baseball is that in my father s view I should have been studying foreign policy and not worrying about whether I was going to catch a ball I should make it clear that my mother loved sports It would have taken a hospitalization for her to miss one of my games I had decided to follow my dad s advice and not play intercollegiate sports in college Then our high school football coach informed me that the Stanford football coach wanted to have lunch with Merlin Olsen and me Those of you who are younger may not know Merlin He was an incredible all American tackle on the Logan High School football team where I played quarterback and safety and returned kickoffs and punts In high school Merlin was recruited by most football powers across the nation In college he won the Outland Trophy as the nation s best interior lineman Merlin was ultimately the third overall pick in the National Football League draft and played in an amazing 14 consecutive Pro Bowls He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982 20The lunch with the Stanford coach was at the Bluebird restaurant in Logan Utah After we shook hands he never once made eye contact with me He talked directly to Merlin but ignored me At the end of the lunch for the first time he turned toward me but he could not remember my name He then informed Merlin If you choose Stanford and want to bring your friend with you he has good enough grades and it could probably be arranged This experience confirmed for me that I should follow my dad s wise counsel My intent is not to discourage participation in sports or the use of the Internet or other worthwhile activities young people enjoy They are the kind of activities that require moderation balance and wisdom When used wisely they enrich our lives However I encourage everyone young and old to review goals and objectives and strive to exercise greater discipline Our daily conduct and choices should be consistent with our goals We need to rise above rationalizations and distractions It is especially important to make choices consistent with our covenants to serve Jesus Christ in righteousness 21 We must not take our eyes off or drop that ball for any reason This life is the time to prepare to meet God 22 We are a happy joyous people We appreciate a good sense of humor and treasure unstructured time with friends and family But we need to recognize that there is a seriousness of purpose that must undergird our approach to life and all our choices Distractions and rationalizations that limit progress are harmful enough but when they diminish faith in Jesus Christ and His Church they are tragic My prayer is that as a body of priesthood holders we will make our conduct consistent with the noble purposes required of those who are in the service of the Master In all things we should remember that being valiant in the testimony of Jesus is the great dividing test between the celestial and terrestrial kingdoms 23 We want to be found on the celestial side of that divide As one of His Apostles I bear fervent testimony of the reality of the Atonement and the divinity of Jesus Christ our Savior In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Just before his death from cancer in 1981 the controversial writer William Saroyan told the press Everybody has to die but I always believed an exception would be made in my case Now what 1The now what in the face of death in this life and the now what in contemplation of life after death are at the heart of the questions of the soul that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ answers so beautifully in the Father s plan of happiness In this life we laugh we cry we work we play we live and then we die Job asks the succinct question If a man die shall he live again 2 The answer is a resounding yes because of the atoning sacrifice of the Savior Part of Job s diverse preamble to the question is interesting Man that is born of a woman is of few days He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down There is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease and bring forth boughs like a plant 3Our Father s plan is about families Several of our most poignant scriptures use the concept of the tree with its roots and branches as an analogy In the closing chapter of the Old Testament Malachi in describing the Second Coming of the Savior vividly uses this analogy Speaking of the proud and wicked he notes that they shall be burned as stubble and that it shall leave them neither root nor branch 4 Malachi closes this chapter with the Lord s reassuring promise Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse 5At the dawn of the Restoration Moroni reemphasized this message in his initial instruction to young Joseph Smith in 1823 6Christians and Jews the world over accept the Old Testament account of Elijah 7 He was the last prophet to hold the sealing power of the Melchizedek Priesthood before the time of Jesus Christ 8Elijah Restores KeysElijah s return occurred in the Kirtland Temple on April 3 1836 He declared he was fulfilling Malachi s promise He committed the priesthood keys for sealing families in this dispensation 9 Elijah s mission is facilitated by what is sometimes called the spirit of Elijah which as Elder Russell M Nelson has taught is a manifestation of the Holy Ghost bearing witness of the divine nature of the family 10The Savior was emphatic about the necessity of baptism He taught Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God 11 The Savior was personally baptized to set the example What about the deceased who have not been baptized Doctrine of Temple and Family History WorkOn October 11 1840 in Nauvoo Vilate Kimball wrote a letter to her husband Elder Heber C Kimball who with other members of the Twelve was serving a mission in Great Britain The October general conference had been held a few days before I quote from parts of Vilate s personal letter We had the largest and most interesting conference that ever has been since the Church was organized President Joseph Smith has opened a new and glorious subject That is being baptized for the dead Paul speaks of it in First Corinthians 15th chapter 29th verse Joseph has received a more full explanation of it by revelation He says it is the privilege of members of this Church to be baptized for all their kinsfolk that have died before this gospel came forth By so doing we act as agents for them and give them the privilege of coming forth in the First Resurrection He says they will have the gospel preached to them in prison Vilate added I want to be baptized for my mother Is not this a glorious doctrine 12The essential doctrine of uniting families came forth line upon line and precept upon precept Vicarious ordinances are at the heart of welding together eternal families connecting roots to branches The doctrine of the family in relation to family history and temple work is clear The Lord in initial revelatory instructions referred to baptism for your dead 13 Our doctrinal obligation is to our own ancestors This is because the celestial organization of heaven is based on families 14 The First Presidency has encouraged members especially youth and young single adults to emphasize family history work and ordinances for their own family names or the names of ancestors of their ward and stake members 15 We need to be connected to both our roots and branches The thought of being associated in the eternal realm is indeed glorious TemplesWilford Woodruff indicated that the Prophet Joseph Smith lived long enough to lay the foundation for temple work By the last time he Joseph Smith ever met with the Quorum of the Twelve he had given them their endowments 16After the Prophet s martyrdom the Saints completed the Nauvoo Temple and the sealing power was used to bless thousands of faithful members before the exodus to the Mountain West Thirty years later at the completion of the St George Temple President Brigham Young noted the eternal significance of saving ordinances finally being available for both the living and the dead 17This is simply stated by President Wilford Woodruff There is hardly any principle the Lord has revealed that I have rejoiced more in than in the redemption of our dead that we will have our fathers our mothers our wives and our children with us in the family organization in the morning of the first resurrection and in the Celestial Kingdom These are grand principles They are worth every sacrifice 18What a great time to be alive This is the last dispensation and we can feel the hastening of the work of salvation in every area where a saving ordinance is involved 19 We now have temples across much of the world to provide these saving ordinances Attending the temple for spiritual renewal peace safety and direction in our lives is also a great blessing 20Less than a year after President Thomas S Monson was called as an Apostle he dedicated the Los Angeles Temple Genealogical Library He spoke of deceased ancestors waiting for the day when you and I will do the research which is necessary to clear the way and likewise go into the house of God and perform that work that they cannot perform 21When then Elder Monson delivered those dedicatory remarks on June 20 1964 there were only 12 operating temples During the period President Monson has served in the senior councils of the Church 130 of our 142 operating temples have had their initial dedication It is nothing short of miraculous to see the hastening of the work of salvation in our day Twenty eight more temples have been announced and are in various stages of completion Eighty five percent of the Church members now live within 200 miles 320 km of a temple Family History TechnologyFamily history technology has also advanced dramatically President Howard W Hunter declared in November 1994 We have begun using information technology to hasten the sacred work of providing ordinances for the deceased The role of technology has been accelerated by the Lord himself However we stand only on the threshold of what we can do with these tools 22In the 19 years since this prophetic statement the acceleration of technology is almost unbelievable A 36 year old mother of young children recently exclaimed to me Just think we have gone from microfilm readers in dedicated family history centers to sitting at my kitchen table with my computer doing family history after my children are finally asleep Brothers and sisters family history centers are now in our homes Temple and family history work is not just about us Think of those on the other side of the veil waiting for the saving ordinances that would free them from the bondage of spirit prison Prison is defined as a state of confinement or captivity 23 Those in captivity might be asking William Saroyan s question Now what One faithful sister shared a special spiritual experience in the Salt Lake Temple While in the confirmation room after a vicarious confirmation ordinance was pronounced she heard And the prisoner shall go free She felt a great sense of urgency for those who were waiting for their baptismal and confirmation work Upon returning home she searched the scriptures for the phrase she had heard She found Joseph Smith s declaration in section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants Let your hearts rejoice and be exceedingly glad Let the earth break forth into singing Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel who hath ordained before the world was that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison for the prisoners shall go free 24The question is what do we need to do The Prophet Joseph s counsel was to present in the temple the records of our dead which shall be worthy of all acceptation 25The leadership of the Church has issued a clarion call to the rising generation to lead the way in the use of technology to experience the spirit of Elijah to search out their ancestors and to perform temple ordinances for them 26 Much of the heavy lifting in hastening the work of salvation for both the living and the dead will be done by you young people 27If the youth in each ward will not only go to the temple and do baptisms for their dead but also work with their families and other ward members to provide the family names for the ordinance work they perform both they and the Church will be greatly blessed Don t underestimate the influence of the deceased in assisting your efforts and the joy of ultimately meeting those you serve The eternally significant blessing of uniting our own families is almost beyond comprehension 28In the worldwide membership of the Church fifty one percent of adults currently do not have both parents in the Family Tree section of the Church s FamilySearch Internet site Sixty five percent of adults do not have all four grandparents listed 29 Remember we without our roots and branches cannot be saved Church members need to obtain and input this vital information We finally have the doctrine the temples and the technology for families to accomplish this glorious work of salvation I suggest one way this might be done Families could hold a Family Tree Gathering This should be a recurring effort Everyone would bring existing family histories stories and photos including cherished possessions of grandparents and parents Our young people are excited to learn about the lives of family members where they came from and how they lived Many have had their hearts turned to the fathers They love the stories and photos and they have the technological expertise to scan and upload these stories and photos to Family Tree and connect source documents with ancestors to preserve these for all time Of course the main objective is to determine what ordinances still need to be done and make assignments for the essential temple work The My Family booklet can be utilized to help record family information stories and photos that can then be uploaded to Family Tree Family commitments and expectations should be at the top of our priorities to protect our divine destiny For those who are looking for more fruitful use of the Sabbath day for the family as a whole the hastening of this work is fertile ground One mother glowingly tells how her 17 year old son gets on the computer after church on Sunday to do family history work and her 10 year old son loves to hear the stories and see pictures of his ancestors This has blessed their entire family to experience the spirit of Elijah Our precious roots and branches must be nourished Jesus Christ gave His life as a vicarious atonement He resolved the ultimate question raised by Job He overcame death for all mankind which we could not do for ourselves We can however perform vicarious ordinances and truly become saviors on Mount Zion30 for our own families in order that we with them might be exalted as well as saved I bear witness of the Savior s atoning sacrifice and the certainty of the Father s plan for us and our families In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Early in our marriage my wife Mary and I decided that to the extent possible we would choose activities that we could attend together We also wanted to be prudent with our budget Mary loves music and was undoubtedly concerned that I might overemphasize sporting events so she negotiated that for all paid events there would be two musicals operas or cultural activities for each paid ball game Initially I was resistant to the opera component but over time I changed my view I particularly came to enjoy the operas by Giuseppe Verdi 1 This week will be the 200th anniversary of his birth In his youth Verdi was intrigued with the prophet Jeremiah and in 1842 at the age of 28 he achieved fame with the opera Nabucco a shortened Italian form of the name Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon This opera contains concepts drawn from the books of Jeremiah Lamentations and Psalms in the Old Testament The opera includes the conquest of Jerusalem and the captivity and bondage of the Jews Psalm 137 is the inspiration for Verdi s moving and inspiring Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves The heading of this psalm in our scriptures is very dramatic While in captivity the Jews wept by the rivers of Babylon Because of sorrow they could not bear to sing the songs of Zion My purpose is to review many forms of bondage and subjugation I will compare some circumstances of our day with those in the days of Jeremiah before the downfall of Jerusalem In presenting this voice of warning I am grateful that most Church members are righteously avoiding the conduct that was so offensive to the Lord in Jeremiah s time The prophecies and lamentations of Jeremiah are important to Latter day Saints Jeremiah and the Jerusalem of his day are the backdrop to the beginning chapters in the Book of Mormon Jeremiah was a contemporary of the prophet Lehi 2 The Lord dramatically informed Jeremiah of his foreordination Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations 3Lehi had a different calling mission and assignment from the Lord He was not called in his youth but in his maturity Initially his was a voice of warning but after faithfully declaring the same message as Jeremiah Lehi was commanded by the Lord to take his family and depart into the wilderness 4 In doing so Lehi blessed not only his family but also all people During the years before the destruction of Jerusalem 5 the messages the Lord gave to Jeremiah are haunting He said My people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed out broken cisterns that can hold no water 6Speaking of the calamities to come upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Lord lamented For them the harvest is past the summer is ended and they are not saved 7God intended that men and women would be free to make choices between good and evil When evil choices become the dominant characteristic of a culture or nation there are serious consequences both in this life and the life to come People can become enslaved or put themselves in bondage not only to harmful addictive substances but also to harmful addictive philosophies that detract from righteous living Turning from the worship of the true and living God and worshipping false gods like wealth and fame and engaging in immoral and unrighteous conduct result in bondage in all its insidious manifestations These include spiritual physical and intellectual bondage and sometimes bring destruction Jeremiah and Lehi also taught that those who are righteous must help the Lord establish His Church and kingdom and gather scattered Israel 8These messages have echoed and been reinforced across the centuries in all dispensations They are at the heart of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in this the final dispensation The captivity of the Jews and the scattering of the tribes of Israel including the ten tribes are prominent doctrinal factors in the Restoration of the gospel The ten lost tribes made up the Northern Kingdom of Israel and were carried away captive into Assyria in 721 B C They went to the north countries 9 Our tenth article of faith states We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes 10 We also believe that as part of the covenant the Lord made with Abraham not only the lineage of Abraham would be blessed but also all the people of the earth would be blessed As Elder Russell M Nelson has stated the gathering is not a matter of physical location it is a matter of individual commitment People can be brought to the knowledge of the Lord 3 Nephi 20 13 without leaving their homelands 11Our doctrine is clear The Lord scattered and afflicted the twelve tribes of Israel because of their unrighteousness and rebellion However the Lord also utilized this scattering of his chosen people among the nations of the world to bless those nations 12We learn valuable lessons from this tragic period We should do everything within our power to avoid the sin and rebellion that lead to bondage 13 We also recognize that righteous living is a prerequisite for assisting the Lord in gathering His elect and in the literal gathering of Israel Bondage subjugation addictions and servitude come in many forms They can be literal physical enslavement but can also be loss or impairment of moral agency that can impede our progress Jeremiah is clear that unrighteousness and rebellion were the main reasons for the destruction of Jerusalem and captivity in Babylon 14Other kinds of bondage are equally destructive of the human spirit Moral agency can be abused in many ways 15 I will mention four that are particularly pernicious in today s culture First addictions that impair agency contradict moral beliefs and destroy good health cause bondage The impact of drugs and alcohol immorality pornography gambling financial subjugation and other afflictions imposes on those in bondage and on society a burden of such magnitude that it is almost impossible to quantify Second some addictions or predilections while not inherently evil can use up our precious allotment of time which could otherwise be used to accomplish virtuous objectives These can include excessive use of social media video and digital games sports recreation and many others 16How we preserve time for family is one of the most significant issues we face in most cultures At a time when I was the only member of the Church in our law firm one woman lawyer explained to me how she always felt like a juggler trying to keep three balls in the air at the same time One ball was her law practice one was her marriage and one was her children She had almost given up on time for herself She was greatly concerned that one of the balls was always on the ground I suggested we meet as a group and discuss our priorities We determined that the primary reason we were working was to support our families We agreed that making more money wasn t nearly as important as our families but we recognized that serving our clients to the best of our abilities was essential The discussion then moved to what we did at work that was not necessary and was inconsistent with leaving time for family Was there pressure to spend time in the workplace that was not essential 17 We decided that our goal would be a family friendly environment for both women and men Let us be at the forefront in protecting time for family Third the most universal subjugation in our day as it has been throughout history is ideology or political beliefs that are inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ Substituting the philosophies of men for gospel truth can lead us away from the simplicity of the Savior s message When the Apostle Paul visited Athens he tried to teach of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ Of this effort we read in Acts For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing 18 When the crowd realized the simple religious nature of Paul s message which was not new they rejected it This is emblematic of our own day where gospel truths are often rejected or distorted to make them intellectually more appealing or compatible with current cultural trends and intellectual philosophies If we are not careful we can be captured by these trends and place ourselves in intellectual bondage There are many voices now telling women how to live 19 They often contradict each other Of particular concern are philosophies that criticize or diminish respect for women who choose to make the sacrifices necessary to be mothers teachers nurturers or friends to children A few months ago our two youngest granddaughters visited us one each week I was at home and answered the door My wife Mary was in another room In both cases after a hug they said almost the same thing They looked around and then said I love to be in Grandma s house Where is Grandma I didn t say it to them but I was thinking Isn t this Grandpa s house too But I realized that when I was a boy our family went to Grandma s house The words of a familiar song came into my mind Over the river and through the woods to Grandmother s house we go Now let me say unequivocally that I am thrilled with the educational and other opportunities that are available to women I treasure the fact that the backbreaking work and domestic drudgery required of women has been reduced in much of the world because of modern conveniences and that women are making such magnificent contributions in every field of endeavor But if we allow our culture to reduce the special relationship that children have with mothers and grandmothers and others who nurture them we will come to regret it Fourth forces that violate sincerely held religious principles can result in bondage One of the most invidious forms is when righteous people who feel accountable to God for their conduct are forced into activities that violate their conscience for example health providers forced to choose between assisting with abortions against their consciences or losing their jobs The Church is a relatively small minority even when linked with people who are like minded It will be hard to change society at large but we must work to improve the moral culture that surrounds us Latter day Saints in every country should be good citizens participate in civic affairs educate themselves on the issues and vote Our primary emphasis however should always be to make any necessary sacrifices to protect our own family and the rising generation 20 The vast majority of them are not yet in bondage to serious addictions or false ideologies We must help inoculate them from a world that sounds a lot like the Jerusalem that Lehi and Jeremiah experienced In addition we need to prepare them to make and keep sacred covenants and to be the principal emissaries to help the Lord establish His Church and gather scattered Israel and the Lord s elect everywhere 21 As the Doctrine and Covenants beautifully reads The righteous shall be gathered out from among all nations and shall come to Zion singing with songs of everlasting joy 22Our challenge is to avoid bondage of any kind help the Lord gather His elect and sacrifice for the rising generation We must always remember that we do not save ourselves We are liberated by the love grace and atoning sacrifice of the Savior When Lehi s family fled they were led by the Lord s light If we are true to His light follow His commandments and rely on His merits we will avoid spiritual physical and intellectual bondage as well as the lamentation of wandering in our own wilderness for He is mighty to save Let us avoid the despair and sorrow of those who fall into captivity and can no longer bear to sing the songs of Zion In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Recent experiences have caused me to reflect on the doctrine of peace and especially the role of Jesus Christ in helping each of us obtain lasting personal peace Two events in the past few months have touched me deeply First I spoke at the funeral for Emilie Parker a precious six year old who lost her life along with 25 others including 19 young children in a tragic shooting in Newtown Connecticut I mourned with her family and recognized that many had been deprived of peace I found strength and faith in her parents Robert and Alissa Parker Second I met with thousands of faithful members of the Church in the Ivory Coast city of Abidjan 1 This French speaking West African country has endured economic hardship a military coup and two recent civil wars concluding in 2011 Yet I felt a special peace in their presence Events often occur that rob us of peace and heighten our sense of vulnerability Who can forget the evil attacks of September 11 2001 on various U S locations Such events remind us how quickly our feelings of peace and safety can be destroyed Our oldest son and his wife who were expecting their first child lived three blocks from the World Trade Center in New York City when the first plane crashed into the North Tower They went to the roof of their apartment building and were horrified as they watched what they thought was some kind of terrible accident Then they witnessed the second plane crash into the South Tower They immediately realized that this was no accident and believed lower Manhattan was under attack When the South Tower collapsed their apartment building was engulfed in the dust cloud that rained down over lower Manhattan Confused about what they had witnessed and concerned about further attacks they made their way to a safer area and then to the Manhattan stake Church building at Lincoln Center When they arrived they found that dozens of other members in lower Manhattan had made the same decision to gather at the stake center They called to let us know where they were I was relieved that they were safe but not surprised at their location Modern revelation teaches that the stakes of Zion are a defense and a refuge from the storm and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth 2They could not return to their apartment for over a week and were devastated by the loss of innocent lives but they suffered no permanent damage In contemplating these events I have been impressed with the doctrinal difference between universal or world peace and personal peace 3At the birth of the Savior a multitude of the heavenly host praised God and proclaimed Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men 4However it has been poignantly noted that even in this eternally significant period following the birth of the Son of God Herod the king carried out the slaughter of innocent infants in Bethlehem 5Agency is essential to the plan of happiness It allows for the love sacrifice personal growth and experience necessary for our eternal progression This agency also allows for all the pain and suffering we experience in mortality even when caused by things we do not understand and the devastating evil choices of others The very War in Heaven was waged over our moral agency and is essential to understanding the Savior s earthly ministry As recited in the 10th chapter of Matthew the Savior instructed the Twelve and acknowledged that His mission would not achieve universal peace in this mortal life The Apostles were told to leave peace upon the worthy houses they visited but warned that they would be in the midst of wolves and hated of all men for my name s sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved 6 A significant pronouncement is made in verse 34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth 7 It is clear that universal peace did not exist on the earth during Christ s mortal ministry and it does not now In the Lord s preface to the Doctrine and Covenants a number of very important principles are taught With respect to those who do not repent His Spirit the Spirit of Christ which is given to every person who comes into the world 8 shall not always strive with man 9 Also peace shall be taken from the earth 10 Prophets have declared that peace has indeed been taken from the earth 11 Lucifer has not yet been bound and exercises power in this dominion 12The heavenly aspiration of good people everywhere has and always will be for peace in the world We must never give up on achieving this goal But President Joseph F Smith taught There never can come to the world that spirit of peace and love until mankind will receive God s truth and God s message and acknowledge his power and authority which is divine 13We earnestly hope and pray for universal peace but it is as individuals and families that we achieve the kind of peace that is the promised reward of righteousness This peace is a promised gift of the Savior s mission and atoning sacrifice This principle is succinctly captured in the Doctrine and Covenants But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come 14President John Taylor taught that peace is not only desirable but it is the gift of God 15The peace to which I am referring is not just a temporary tranquility It is an abiding deep happiness and spiritual contentment 16President Heber J Grant described the Savior s peace this way His peace will ease our suffering bind up our broken hearts blot out our hates engender in our breasts a love of fellow men that will suffuse our souls with calm and happiness 17 In my meetings with Emilie Parker s parents I saw that the Savior s peace has eased their suffering and is helping to bind up their broken hearts It is notable that immediately after the shooting Brother Parker expressed forgiveness to the perpetrator As President Grant said the Savior s peace can blot out our hates Judgment is the Lord s The Ivory Coast Saints during the period of civil war in their country found peace by focusing on living the gospel of Jesus Christ with particular emphasis on family history and temple work for their ancestors 18We all long for peace Peace is not just safety or lack of war violence conflict and contention Peace comes from knowing that the Savior knows who we are and knows that we have faith in Him love Him and keep His commandments even and especially amid life s devastating trials and tragedies The Lord s answer to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail brings solace to the heart My son peace be unto thy soul thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment And then if thou endure it well God shall exalt thee on high 19Remember God is not the author of confusion but the author of peace 20 For those who reject God there is no peace We all participated in the councils of heaven that provided for moral agency knowing that there would be mortal pain and even unspeakable tragedy because of the abuse of agency We understood that this could leave us angry bewildered defenseless and vulnerable But we also knew that the Savior s Atonement would overcome and compensate for all of the unfairness of mortal life and bring us peace Elder Marion D Hanks had a framed statement on his wall by Ugo Betti To believe in God is to know that all the rules will be fair and that there will be wonderful surprises 21What are the sources of peace Many search for peace in worldly ways which never have and never will succeed Peace is not found by attaining great wealth power or prominence 22 Peace is not found in the pursuit of pleasure entertainment or leisure None of these can even when attained in abundance create any lasting happiness or peace Emma Lou Thayne s beloved hymn asks the appropriate questions Where can I turn for peace Where is my solace when other sources cease to make me whole 23 The answer is the Savior who is the source and author of peace He is the Prince of Peace 24How do we stay close to the Savior Humbling ourselves before God praying always repenting of sins entering the waters of baptism with a broken heart and contrite spirit and becoming true disciples of Jesus Christ are profound examples of the righteousness that is rewarded by abiding peace 25 After King Benjamin delivered his stirring message concerning the Atonement of Christ the multitude fell to the earth The Spirit of the Lord came upon them and they were filled with joy having received a remission of their sins and having peace of conscience because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ 26 Repentance and living righteously allow for peace of conscience which is essential for contentment 27 When there has been a major transgression confession is required to bring peace 28 Perhaps there is nothing to compare with the peace that comes from a sin wracked soul unloading his or her burdens on the Lord and claiming the blessings of the Atonement As another favorite Church hymn puts it I ll drop my burden at his feet and bear a song away 29My heart rejoices when I realize that in our day tens of thousands of young men young women and senior missionaries have accepted the call to be emissaries of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ They are taking the restored gospel of peace to the world one person and one family at a time a work of righteousness to bring this peace to Heavenly Father s children The Church is a refuge where followers of Christ attain peace Some young people in the world say they are spiritual but not religious Feeling spiritual is a good first step However it is in the Church that we are fellowshipped taught and nourished by the good word of God More importantly it is priesthood authority in the Church that provides for sacred ordinances and covenants that bind families together and qualify each of us to return to God the Father and Jesus Christ in the celestial kingdom These ordinances bring peace because they are covenants with the Lord Temples are where many of these sacred ordinances occur and are also a source of peaceful refuge from the world Those who visit temple grounds or participate in temple open houses also feel this peace One experience preeminent in my mind is the Suva Fiji Temple open house and dedication There had been political upheaval resulting in rebels burning and looting downtown Suva occupying the houses of Parliament and holding legislators hostage The country was under martial law The Fiji military gave the Church limited permission to assemble people for the open house and a very small group for the dedication The members as a whole were uninvited due to concerns for their safety It was the only temple dedication since the original Nauvoo Temple that was held under very difficult circumstances One person invited to the open house was a lovely Hindu woman of Indian descent a member of Parliament who was initially held hostage but was released because she was female In the celestial room free from the turmoil of the world she dissolved in tears as she expressed feelings of peace that overwhelmed her She felt the Holy Ghost comforting and bearing witness of the sacred nature of the temple The Savior is the source of true peace Even with the trials of life because of the Savior s Atonement and His grace righteous living will be rewarded with personal peace In the intimate setting of the Passover chamber the Savior promised His Apostles that they would be blessed with the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost and then uttered these important words Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you 30 Then just before His Intercessory Prayer These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 31Eliza R Snow penned this concept beautifully Lift up your hearts in praise to God Let your rejoicings never cease Though tribulations rage abroad Christ says In me ye shall have peace 32I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
President Monson we love honor and sustain you This historically significant announcement with respect to missionary service is inspiring I can remember the excitement in 1960 when the age for young men serving was reduced from 20 years of age to 19 I arrived in the British Mission as a newly called 20 year old The first 19 year old in our mission was Elder Jeffrey R Holland an incredible addition He was a few months shy of being 20 Then over the course of a year many more 19 year olds arrived They were obedient and faithful missionaries and the work progressed I am confident that an even greater harvest will be achieved now as righteous committed missionaries fulfill the Savior s commandment to preach His gospel In my view those of you in the rising generation are better prepared than any previous generation Your knowledge of the scriptures is particularly impressive However the challenges your generation faces as you prepare for service are similar to those faced by all members of the Church We are all aware the culture in most of the world is not conducive to righteousness or spiritual commitment Throughout history Church leaders have warned the people and taught repentance In the Book of Mormon Alma the Younger was so concerned about unrighteousness and lack of commitment that he resigned as chief judge the leader of the people of Nephi and concentrated all his efforts on his prophetic calling 1In one of the most profound verses in all of scripture Alma proclaims If ye have experienced a change of heart and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love I would ask can ye feel so now 2Local leaders across the world report that when viewed as a whole Church members especially our youth have never been stronger But they almost always raise two concerns first the challenge of increased unrighteousness in the world and second the apathy and lack of commitment of some members They seek counsel about how to help members to follow the Savior and achieve a deep and lasting conversion This question Can ye feel so now rings across the centuries With all that we have received in this dispensation including the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ the outpouring of spiritual gifts and the indisputable blessings of heaven Alma s challenge has never been more important Soon after Ezra Taft Benson was called as an Apostle in 1943 President George Albert Smith3 counseled Your mission is to warn the people in as kind a way as possible that repentance will be the only panacea for the ills of this world 4 When this statement was made we were in the midst of the conflagration of World War II Today moral deterioration has escalated One prominent writer recently said Everyone knows the culture is poisonous and nobody expects that to change 5 The constant portrayal of violence and immorality in music entertainment art and other media in our day to day culture is unprecedented This was dramatically described by a highly respected Baptist theologian when he stated The spiritual immune system of an entire civilization has been wounded 6It is not surprising that some in the Church believe they can t answer Alma s question with a resounding yes They do not feel so now They feel they are in a spiritual drought Others are angry hurt or disillusioned If these descriptions apply to you 7 it is important to evaluate why you cannot feel so now Many who are in a spiritual drought and lack commitment have not necessarily been involved in major sins or transgressions but they have made unwise choices Some are casual in their observance of sacred covenants Others spend most of their time giving first class devotion to lesser causes Some allow intense cultural or political views to weaken their allegiance to the gospel of Jesus Christ Some have immersed themselves in Internet materials that magnify exaggerate and in some cases invent shortcomings of early Church leaders Then they draw incorrect conclusions that can affect testimony Any who have made these choices can repent and be spiritually renewed Immersion in the scriptures is essential for spiritual nourishment 8 The word of God inspires commitment and acts as a healing balm for hurt feelings anger or disillusionment 9 When our commitment is diminished for any reason part of the solution is repentance 10 Commitment and repentance are closely intertwined C S Lewis the striving pragmatic Christian writer poignantly framed the issue He asserted that Christianity tells people to repent and promises them forgiveness but until people know and feel they need forgiveness Christianity does not speak to them He stated When you know you are sick you will listen to the doctor 11The Prophet Joseph pointed out that before your baptism you could be on neutral ground between good and evil But when you joined this Church you enlisted to serve God When you did that you left the neutral ground and you never can go back His counsel was that we must never forsake the Master 12Alma emphasizes that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ the arms of mercy are extended to those who repent 13 He then asks penetrating and ultimate questions such as Are we prepared to meet God Are we keeping ourselves blameless We should all contemplate these questions Alma s own experience in failing to follow his faithful father and then coming to a dramatic understanding of how much he needed forgiveness and what it meant to sing the song of redeeming love is powerful and compelling While anything that lessens commitment is of consequence two relevant challenges are both prevalent and significant The first is unkindness violence and domestic abuse The second is sexual immorality and impure thoughts These often precede and are at the root of the choice to be less committed How we treat those closest to us is of fundamental importance Violence abuse lack of civility and disrespect in the home are not acceptable not acceptable for adults and not acceptable for the rising generation My father was not active in the Church but was a remarkably good example especially in his treatment of my mother He used to say God will hold men responsible for every tear they cause their wives to shed This same concept is emphasized in The Family A Proclamation to the World It reads Those who abuse spouse or offspring will one day stand accountable before God 14 Regardless of the culture in which we are raised and whether our parents did or did not abuse us we must not physically emotionally or verbally abuse anyone else 15The need for civility in society has never been more important The foundation of kindness and civility begins in our homes It is not surprising that our public discourse has declined in equal measure with the breakdown of the family The family is the foundation for love and for maintaining spirituality The family promotes an atmosphere where religious observance can flourish There is indeed beauty all around when there s love at home 16Sexual immorality and impure thoughts violate the standard established by the Savior 17 We were warned at the beginning of this dispensation that sexual immorality would be perhaps the greatest challenge 18 Such conduct will without repentance cause a spiritual drought and loss of commitment Movies TV and the Internet often convey degrading messages and images President Dieter F Uchtdorf and I were recently in an Amazon jungle village and observed satellite dishes even on some of the small simply built huts We rejoiced at the wonderful information available in this remote area We also recognized there is virtually no place on earth that cannot be impacted by salacious immoral and titillating images This is one reason why pornography has become such a plague in our day I recently had an insightful conversation with a 15 year old Aaronic Priesthood holder He helped me understand how easy it is in this Internet age for young people to almost inadvertently be exposed to impure and even pornographic images He pointed out that for most principles the Church teaches there is at least some recognition in society at large that violating these principles can have devastating effects on health and well being He mentioned cigarette smoking drug use and alcohol consumption by young people But he noted that there is no corresponding outcry or even a significant warning from society at large about pornography or immorality My dear brothers and sisters this young man s analysis is correct What is the answer For years prophets and apostles have taught the importance of religious observance in the home 19Parents the days are long past when regular active participation in Church meetings and programs though essential can fulfill your sacred responsibility to teach your children to live moral righteous lives and walk uprightly before the Lord With President Monson s announcement this morning it is essential that this be faithfully accomplished in homes which are places of refuge where kindness forgiveness truth and righteousness prevail Parents must have the courage to filter or monitor Internet access television movies and music Parents must have the courage to say no defend truth and bear powerful testimony Your children need to know that you have faith in the Savior love your Heavenly Father and sustain the leaders of the Church Spiritual maturity must flourish in our homes My hope is that no one will leave this conference without understanding that the moral issues of our day must be addressed in the family Bishops and priesthood and auxiliary leaders need to support families and make sure that spiritual principles are taught Home and visiting teachers can assist especially with children of single parents The young man I mentioned earnestly asked if the Apostles knew how early in life teaching and protecting against pornography and impure thoughts should start With emphasis he stated that in some areas even before youth graduate from Primary is not too early Youth who have been exposed to immoral images at a very early age are terrified that they may have already disqualified themselves for missionary service and sacred covenants As a result their faith can be severely impaired I want to assure you young people as Alma taught that through repentance you can qualify for all the blessings of heaven 20 That is what the Savior s Atonement is all about Please talk with your parents or a trusted adviser and counsel with your bishop When it comes to morality some adults believe that adherence to a single overriding humanitarian project or principle nullifies the need to comply with the Savior s teachings They say to themselves that sexual misconduct is a small thing if I am a kind and charitable person 21 Such thinking is a gross self deception Some young people inform me that in our current culture it is not cool to try too hard in many areas including living strictly in accordance with righteous principles 22 Please do not fall into this trap At baptism we promise to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ having the determination to serve him to the end 23 Such a covenant requires courageous effort commitment and integrity if we are to continue to sing the song of redeeming love and stay truly converted A historic example of commitment to be strong and immovable for all ages was portrayed by a British Olympian who competed in the 1924 Olympics in Paris France Eric Liddell was the son of a Scottish missionary to China and a devoutly religious man He infuriated the British leadership of the Olympics by refusing even under enormous pressure to run in a preliminary 100 meter race held on Sunday Ultimately he was victorious in the 400 meter race Liddell s example of refusing to run on Sunday was particularly inspiring Depictions and memorials in his honor have referred to the inspirational words from Isaiah But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint 24Liddell s admirable conduct was very influential in our youngest son s decision to not participate in Sunday sports and more importantly to separate himself from unrighteous and worldly conduct He used the quote from Isaiah for his yearbook contribution Eric Liddell left a powerful example of determination and commitment to principle As our youth follow President Monson s counsel by preparing to serve missions and as we all live the principles the Savior taught and prepare to meet God 25 we win a much more important race 26 We will have the Holy Ghost as our guide for spiritual direction For any whose lives are not in order remember it is never too late to make the Savior s Atonement the foundation of our faith and lives 27In the words of Isaiah Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool 28My sincere prayer is that each of us will take any necessary action to feel the Spirit now so we can sing the song of redeeming love with all our hearts I testify of the power of the Savior s Atonement in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
As the General Authorities of the Church meet with members all over the world we see firsthand how Latter day Saints are a force for good We commend you for all you do to bless the lives of all people Those of us with public affairs assignments are acutely aware that many opinion leaders and journalists in the United States and around the world have increased their public discussion of the Church and its members A unique confluence of factors has raised the Church s profile significantly 1Many who write about the Church have made a sincere effort to understand our people and our doctrine They have been civil and have tried to be objective for which we are grateful We also recognize that many individuals are not in tune with sacred things Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks of England speaking to Roman Catholic leaders last December at the Pontifical Gregorian University noted how secular some parts of the world have become He stated that one culprit is an aggressive scientific atheism tone deaf to the music of faith 2The great introductory vision in the Book of Mormon is Lehi s prophetic dream of the tree of life 3 This vision starkly describes the challenges to faith that exist in our day and the great divide between those who love worship and feel accountable to God and those who do not Lehi explains some of the conduct that destroys faith Some are proud vain and foolish They are interested only in the so called wisdom of the world 4 Others have some interest in God but are lost in worldly mists of darkness and sin 5 Some have tasted of the love of God and His word but feel ashamed because of those mocking them and fall away into forbidden paths 6Finally there are those who are in tune with the music of faith You know who you are You love the Lord and His gospel and continuously try to live and share His message especially with your families 7 You are in harmony with the promptings of the Spirit have awakened to the power of God s word have religious observance in your homes and diligently try to live Christlike lives as His disciples We recognize how busy you are Without a paid professional ministry the responsibility for administering the Church depends on you consecrated members We know it is common for members of bishoprics and stake presidencies and many others to render long hours of devoted service Auxiliary and quorum presidencies are exemplary in their selfless sacrifice This service and sacrifice extend through the entire membership to those keeping clerical records faithful home and visiting teachers and those teaching classes We are grateful to those who courageously serve as Scoutmasters and nursery leaders as well You all have our love and appreciation for what you do and who you are We acknowledge that there are members who are less interested in and less faithful to some of the Savior s teachings Our desire is for these members to awaken fully to faith and increase their activity and commitment God loves all His children He wants all of them to return to Him He desires everyone to be in tune with the sacred music of faith The Savior s Atonement is a gift for everyone It needs to be taught and understood that we love and respect all of the people whom Lehi described 8 Remember it is not up to us to judge Judgment is the Lord s 9 President Thomas S Monson has specifically asked us to have the courage to refrain from judging others 10 He has also asked every faithful member to rescue those who have tasted of the gospel fruit and then have fallen away as well as those who have not yet found the strait and narrow path We pray that they will hold to the rod and partake of the love of God which will fill their soul s with exceedingly great joy 11While Lehi s vision includes all people the culminating doctrinal concept is the eternal significance of the family The family is ordained of God It is the most important unit in time and in eternity 12 As Lehi partook of the fruit of the tree of life the love of God he was desirous that his family should partake of it also 13Our great desire is to raise our children in truth and righteousness One principle that will help us accomplish this is to avoid being overly judgmental about conduct that is foolish or unwise but not sinful Many years ago when my wife and I had children at home Elder Dallin H Oaks taught that it was important to distinguish between youthful mistakes which should be corrected and sins that require chastening and repentance 14 Where there is lack of wisdom our children need instruction Where there is sin repentance is essential 15 We found this to be helpful in our own family Religious observance in the home blesses our families Example is particularly important What we are speaks so loudly that our children may not hear what we say When I was nearly five years old my mother received word that her younger brother had been killed when the battleship on which he was serving was bombed off the coast of Japan near the end of World War II 16 This news was devastating to her She was very emotional and went into the bedroom After a while I peeked into the room to see if she was OK She was kneeling by the bed in prayer A great peace came over me because she had taught me to pray and love the Savior This was typical of the example she always set for me Mothers and fathers praying with children may be more important than any other example The message ministry and Atonement of Jesus Christ our Savior are our essential family curriculum No scripture characterizes our faith better than 2 Nephi 25 26 And we talk of Christ we rejoice in Christ we preach of Christ we prophesy of Christ and we write according to our prophecies that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins One of the underlying premises of Lehi s vision is that faithful members must hold fast to the rod of iron to keep them on the strait and narrow path leading to the tree of life It is essential for members to read ponder and study the scriptures 17The Book of Mormon is of seminal importance 18 There will of course always be those who underestimate the significance of or even disparage this sacred book Some have used humor Before I served a mission a university professor quoted Mark Twain s statement that if you took And it came to pass out of the Book of Mormon it would have been only a pamphlet 19A few months later while I was serving a mission in London England a distinguished Oxford educated teacher at London University an Egyptian expert in Semitic languages read the Book of Mormon corresponded with President David O McKay and met with missionaries He informed them he was convinced the Book of Mormon was indeed a translation of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians for the periods described in the Book of Mormon 20 One example among many he used was the conjunctive phrase And it came to pass which he said mirrored how he would translate phraseology used in ancient Semitic writings 21 The professor was informed that while his intellectual approach based on his profession had helped him it was still essential to have a spiritual testimony Through study and prayer he gained a spiritual witness and was baptized So what one famous humorist saw as an object of ridicule a scholar recognized as profound evidence of the truth of the Book of Mormon which was confirmed to him by the Spirit The essential doctrine of agency requires that a testimony of the restored gospel be based on faith rather than just external or scientific proof Obsessive focus on things not yet fully revealed such as how the virgin birth or the Resurrection of the Savior could have occurred or exactly how Joseph Smith translated our scriptures will not be efficacious or yield spiritual progress These are matters of faith Ultimately Moroni s counsel to read and ponder and then ask God in all sincerity of heart with real intent to confirm scriptural truths by the witness of the Spirit is the answer 22 In addition when we inculcate into our lives scriptural imperatives and live the gospel we are blessed with the Spirit and taste of His goodness with feelings of joy happiness and especially peace 23Clearly a dividing line between those who hear the music of faith and those who are tone deaf or off key is the active study of the scriptures I was deeply touched years ago that a beloved prophet Spencer W Kimball emphasized the need to continually read and study the scriptures He said I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking that I am far far away If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns 24I hope we are reading the Book of Mormon with our children regularly I have discussed this with my own children They have shared with me two observations First persistence in reading the scriptures daily as a family is the key My daughter in a lighthearted way describes their early morning efforts with mostly teenage children to consistently read the scriptures She and her husband wake up early in the morning and move through the blurry mist to grasp the iron railing that lines their staircase to where their family gathers to read the word of God Persistence is the answer and a sense of humor helps It requires great effort from every family member every day but it is worth the effort Temporary setbacks are overshadowed by persistence The second is how our youngest son and his wife are reading the scriptures with their young family Two out of their four children are not old enough to read For the five year old they have five finger signals to which he responds in order for him to participate fully in the family scripture reading The signal for finger 1 is for him to repeat And it came to pass whenever it appears in the Book of Mormon I have to admit that I love the fact that the phrase appears so often Incidentally for the interest of young families finger signal 2 is And thus we see fingers 3 4 and 5 are chosen by the parents based on the words contained in the chapter they are reading We know that family scripture study and family home evenings are not always perfect Regardless of the challenges you face do not become discouraged Please understand that having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and keeping His commandments are and always will be the defining test of mortality Above all else each of us must realize that when one is tone deaf to the music of faith he or she is out of tune with the Spirit As the prophet Nephi taught Ye have heard his voice and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice but ye were past feeling that ye could not feel his words 25Our doctrine is clear we are to be positive and of good cheer We emphasize our faith not our fears We rejoice in the Lord s assurance that He will stand by us and give us guidance and direction 26 The Holy Ghost testifies to our hearts that we have a loving Father in Heaven whose merciful plan for our redemption will be fulfilled in every aspect because of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ As Naomi W Randall author of I Am a Child of God penned His Spirit guides his love assures that fear departs when faith endures 27Let us therefore wherever we are on the path of discipleship in Lehi s vision resolve to awaken within us and our families a greater desire to claim the Savior s incomprehensible gift of eternal life I pray that we will stay in tune with the music of faith I testify of the divinity of Jesus Christ and the reality of His Atonement in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Many people face significant problems or even tragedy during this mortal journey All over the world we see examples of trials and tribulations 1 We are moved in our souls by television images of death acute suffering and despair We see the Japanese struggling heroically against devastation from an earthquake and tsunami The haunting scenes from the destruction of the World Trade Center towers which we recently reviewed were painful to relive Something stirs us when we become aware of such tragedy especially when suffered by innocent people Sometimes tragedies are very personal A son or daughter dies early in life or falls victim to a devastating disease A loving parent s life is taken because of a thoughtless act or accident Whenever tragedy occurs we mourn and strive to bear one another s burdens 2 We lament the things that will not be accomplished and the songs that will not be sung Among the most frequently asked questions of Church leaders are Why does a just God allow bad things to happen especially to good people Why are those who are righteous and in the Lord s service not immune from such tragedies While we do not know all the answers we do know important principles that allow us to face tragedies with faith and confidence that there is a bright future planned for each of us Some of the most important principles are First we have a Father in Heaven who knows and loves us personally and understands our suffering perfectly Second His Son Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer whose Atonement not only provides for salvation and exaltation but also will compensate for all the unfairness of life Third the Father s plan of happiness for His children includes not only a premortal and mortal life but also an eternal life as well including a great and glorious reunion with those we have lost All wrongs will be righted and we will see with perfect clarity and faultless perspective and understanding From the limited perspective of those who do not have knowledge understanding or faith in the Father s plan who look at the world only through the lens of mortality with its wars violence disease and evil this life can seem depressing chaotic unfair and meaningless Church leaders have compared this perspective with someone walking into the middle of a three act play 3 Those without knowledge of the Father s plan do not understand what happened in the first act or the premortal existence and the purposes established there nor do they understand the clarification and resolution that come in the third act which is the glorious fulfillment of the Father s plan Many do not appreciate that under His loving and comprehensive plan those who appear to be disadvantaged through no fault of their own are not ultimately penalized 4In a few months it will be 100 years since the tragic sinking of the Titanic ocean liner The calamitous circumstances surrounding this horrendous event have resonated across the entire century since it occurred The promoters of the new luxury liner which was 11 stories high and almost 3 football fields long 5 made excessive and unjustified claims as to the lack of vulnerability of the Titanic to winter waters full of icebergs This ship was supposedly unsinkable yet when it slipped beneath the surface of the icy Atlantic Ocean over 1 500 souls lost their mortal lives 6In many ways the sinking of the Titanic is a metaphor for life and many gospel principles It is a perfect example of the difficulty of looking only through the lens of this mortal life The loss of life was catastrophic in its consequences but was of an accidental nature With the carnage of two world wars and having just passed the 10th anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Center towers we have seen in our own time a window into the shock agony and moral issues surrounding events resulting from the evil exercise of agency There are terrible repercussions to family friends and nations as a result of these tragedies regardless of the cause With respect to the Titanic lessons were learned about the dangers of pride and traveling in troubled waters and that God is no respecter of persons 7 Those involved were from all walks of life Some were rich and famous such as John Jacob Astor but there were also laborers immigrants women children and crew members 8There were at least two Latter day Saint connections to the Titanic Both illustrate our challenge in understanding trials tribulations and tragedies and provide insight as to how we might deal with them The first is an example of being appreciative for the blessings we receive and the challenges we avoid It involves Alma Sonne who later served as a General Authority 9 He was my stake president when I was born in Logan Utah I had my mission interview with Elder Sonne In those days all prospective missionaries were interviewed by a General Authority He was a great influence in my life When Alma was a young man he had a friend named Fred who was less active in the Church They had numerous discussions about serving a mission and eventually Alma Sonne convinced Fred to prepare and serve They were both called to the British Mission At the conclusion of their missions Elder Sonne the mission secretary made the travel arrangements for their return to the United States He booked passage on the Titanic for himself Fred and four other missionaries who had also completed their missions 10When it came time to travel for some reason Fred was delayed Elder Sonne canceled all six bookings to sail on the new luxury liner on its maiden voyage and booked passage on a ship that sailed the next day 11 The four missionaries who were excited about traveling on the Titanic expressed their disappointment Elder Sonne s answer paraphrased the account of Joseph and his brothers in Egypt recorded in Genesis How can we return to our families and the lad be not with us 12 He explained to his companions that they all came to England together and they all should return home together Elder Sonne subsequently learned of the Titanic s sinking and gratefully said to his friend Fred You saved my life Fred replied No by getting me on this mission you saved my life 13 All of the missionaries thanked the Lord for preserving them 14Sometimes as was the case with Elder Sonne and his missionary associates great blessings come to those who are faithful We should be grateful for all the tender mercies that come into our lives 15 We are unaware of hosts of blessings that we receive from day to day It is extremely important that we have a spirit of gratitude in our hearts 16The scriptures are clear those who are righteous follow the Savior and keep His commandments will prosper in the land 17 An essential element of prospering is having the Spirit in our lives However righteousness prayer and faithfulness will not always result in happy endings in mortality Many will experience severe trials When this happens the very act of having faith and seeking priesthood blessings is approved by God The Lord has declared The elders shall be called and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name and if they die they shall die unto me and if they live they shall live unto me 18It is instructive that the second Latter day Saint connection with the Titanic did not have a happy mortal ending Irene Corbett was 30 years old She was a young wife and mother from Provo Utah She had significant talents as an artist and musician she was also a teacher and a nurse At the urging of medical professionals in Provo she attended a six month course of study on midwife skills in London It was her great desire to make a difference in the world She was careful thoughtful prayerful and valiant One of the reasons she chose the Titanic to return to the United States was because she thought the missionaries would be traveling with her and that this would provide additional safety Irene was one of the few women who did not survive this terrible tragedy Most of the women and children were placed in the lifeboats and were ultimately rescued There were not enough lifeboats for everyone But it is believed that she did not get in the lifeboats because with her special training she was attending to the needs of the numerous passengers who were injured from the iceberg collision 19There are many kinds of challenges Some give us necessary experiences Adverse results in this mortal life are not evidence of lack of faith or of an imperfection in our Father in Heaven s overall plan The refiner s fire is real and qualities of character and righteousness that are forged in the furnace of affliction perfect and purify us and prepare us to meet God When the Prophet Joseph Smith was a prisoner in Liberty Jail the Lord declared to him that multiple calamities can befall mankind The Savior stated in part If thou be cast into the deep if the billowing surge conspire against thee if fierce winds become thine enemy and all the elements combine to hedge up the way these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good 20 The Savior concluded His instruction Thy days are known and thy years shall not be numbered less therefore fear not for God shall be with you forever and ever 21Some challenges result from the agency of others Agency is essential for individual spiritual growth and development Evil conduct is an element of agency Captain Moroni explained this very important doctrine The Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come upon the wicked He made it clear that the righteous are not lost but enter into the rest of the Lord their God 22 The wicked will be held accountable for the atrocities they perpetrate 23Some challenges come from disobedience to God s laws Health problems resulting from smoking alcohol and drug abuse are staggering Incarceration in jails and prisons as a result of alcohol and drug related crime is also very high 24The incidence of divorce because of infidelity is also significant Many of these trials and tribulations could be avoided by obedience to God s laws 25My beloved mission president Elder Marion D Hanks who passed away in August asked us as missionaries to memorize a statement to resist mortal challenges There is no chance no fate no destiny that can circumvent or hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul 26He acknowledged that this doesn t apply to all the challenges we encounter but is true in spiritual matters I have appreciated his counsel in my life One of the reasons for the terrible loss of life on the Titanic is that there were not enough lifeboats Regardless of the trials we face in this life the Savior s Atonement provides lifeboats for everyone For those who think the trials they face are unfair the Atonement covers all of the unfairness of life 27A unique challenge for those who have lost loved ones is to avoid dwelling on the lost opportunities in this life Often those who die early have demonstrated significant capabilities interests and talents With our limited understanding we lament the things that will not be accomplished and the songs that will not be sung This has been described as dying with your music still inside you Music in this case is a metaphor for unfulfilled potential of any kind Sometimes people have made significant preparation but do not have the opportunity to perform in mortality 28 One of the most quoted classical poems Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard by Thomas Gray reflects on such missed opportunities Full many a flower is born to blush unseen And waste its sweetness on the desert air 29The lost opportunity might relate to family occupation talents experiences or others All of these were cut short in the case of Sister Corbett There were songs she did not sing and potential she did not fulfill in this mortal life But when we look through the wide and clear lens of the gospel instead of the limited lens of mere mortal existence we know of the great eternal reward promised by a loving Father in His plan As the Apostle Paul taught Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 30 A line from a beloved hymn provides comfort solace and the clear lens And Jesus listening can hear the songs I cannot sing 31The Savior said Therefore let your hearts be comforted Be still and know that I am God 32 We have His promise that we with our children will sing songs of everlasting joy 33 In the name of Jesus Christ our Savior amen 
Author and historian Wallace Stegner wrote about the Mormon migration and gathering to the Salt Lake Valley He did not accept our faith and in many ways was critical nevertheless he was impressed with the devotion and heroism of our early Church members especially the women He stated Their women were incredible 1 I echo that sentiment today Our Latter day Saint women are incredible God placed within women divine qualities of strength virtue love and the willingness to sacrifice to raise future generations of His spirit children A recent United States study asserts that women of all faiths believe more fervently in God and attend more religious services than men do By virtually every measure they are more religious 2I was not surprised by this result particularly as I reflected on the preeminent role of families and women in our faith Our doctrine is clear Women are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves them Wives are equal to their husbands Marriage requires a full partnership where wives and husbands work side by side to meet the needs of the family 3We know there are many challenges for women including those striving to live the gospel Heritage of Pioneer SistersA predominant attribute in the lives of our pioneer ancestors is the faith of the sisters Women by divine nature have the greater gift and responsibility for home and children and nurturing there and in other settings In light of this the faith of the sisters in being willing to leave their homes to cross the plains for the unknown was inspiring If one had to characterize their most significant attribute it would be their unwavering faith in the restored gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ The heroic accounts of what these pioneer women sacrificed and accomplished as they crossed the plains is a priceless legacy to the Church I am moved by the account of Elizabeth Jackson whose husband Aaron died after the last crossing of the Platte River with the Martin handcart company She wrote I will not attempt to describe my feelings at finding myself thus left a widow with three children under such excruciating circumstances I believe that my sufferings for the Gospel s sake will be sanctified unto me for my good I appealed to the Lord He who had promised to be a husband to the widow and a father to the fatherless I appealed to him and he came to my aid 4Elizabeth said she was writing the history on behalf of those who passed through like scenes with the hope that posterity would be willing to suffer and sacrifice all things for the kingdom of God 5Women in the Church Today Are Strong and ValiantI believe the women of the Church today meet that challenge and are every bit as strong and faithful The priesthood leadership of this Church at all levels gratefully acknowledges the service sacrifice commitment and contribution of the sisters Much of what we accomplish in the Church is due to the selfless service of women Whether in the Church or in the home it is a beautiful thing to see the priesthood and the Relief Society work in perfect harmony Such a relationship is like a well tuned orchestra and the resulting symphony inspires all of us When I was recently assigned to a conference in the Mission Viejo California Stake I was touched by an account of their four stake New Year s Eve youth dance Following the dance a purse was found with no outside identification I share with you part of what Sister Monica Sedgwick the Young Women president in the Laguna Niguel stake recorded We didn t want to pry this was someone s personal stuff So we gingerly opened it and grabbed the first thing that was on top hopefully it would identify her It did but in another way it was a For the Strength of Youth pamphlet Wow This told us something about her Then we reached in for the next item a little notebook Surely this would give us answers but not the kind we were expecting The first page was a list of favorite scriptures There were five more pages of carefully written scriptures and personal notes The sisters immediately wanted to meet this stalwart young woman They returned to that purse to identify its owner They pulled out some breath mints soap lotion and a brush I loved their comments Oh good things come out of her mouth she has clean and soft hands and she takes care of herself They eagerly awaited the next treasure Out came a clever little homemade coin purse made from a cardboard juice carton and there was some money in a zippered pocket They exclaimed Ahh she s creative and prepared They felt like little children on Christmas morning What they pulled out next surprised them even more a recipe for Black Forest chocolate cake and a note to make the cake for a friend s birthday They almost screamed She s a HOMEMAKER Thoughtful and service minded Then yes finally some identification The youth leaders said they felt greatly blessed to observe the quiet example of a young lady living the gospel 6This account illustrates the commitment of our young women to Church standards 7 It is also an example of caring interested dedicated Young Women leaders all over the world They are incredible Sisters have key roles in the Church in family life and as individuals that are essential in Heavenly Father s plan Many of these responsibilities do not provide economic compensation but do provide satisfaction and are eternally significant Recently a delightful and very capable woman on a newspaper editorial board asked for a description of the role of women in the Church It was explained that all of the leaders in our congregations are unpaid She interrupted to say her interest had diminished significantly She said I don t believe women need any more unpaid jobs We pointed out that the most important organization on earth is the family where fathers and mothers are equal partners 8 Neither one is financially compensated but the blessings are beyond description We of course told her about the Relief Society Young Women and Primary organizations that are guided by women presidents We noted that from our earliest history both men and women pray perform the music give the sermons and sing in the choir even in sacrament meeting our most sacred meeting The recent highly acclaimed book American Grace reported on women in many faiths It noted that Latter day Saint women are unique in being overwhelmingly satisfied with their role in Church leadership 9 Furthermore Latter day Saints as a whole men and women have the strongest attachment to their faith of any of the religions studied 10Our women are not incredible because they have managed to avoid the difficulties of life quite the opposite They are incredible because of the way they face the trials of life Despite the challenges and tests life has to offer from marriage or lack of marriage children s choices poor health lack of opportunities and many other problems they remain remarkably strong and immovable and true to the faith Our sisters throughout the Church consistently succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 11One Relief Society president who acknowledged this extraordinary service said Even when the sisters serve they are thinking If only I could have done more Though they are not perfect and all face individual struggles their faith in a loving Father in Heaven and the assurance of the atoning sacrifice of the Savior permeates their lives Role of Sisters in the ChurchDuring the last three years the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve have sought guidance inspiration and revelation as we have counseled with priesthood and auxiliary leaders and worked on the new Church handbooks In this process I have experienced feelings of overwhelming appreciation for the essential role that sisters both married and single have historically played and now play both in the family and in the Church All members of the Church of Jesus Christ are to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men 12 The work of salvation includes member missionary work convert retention activation of less active members temple and family history work teaching the gospel 13 and caring for the poor and needy 14 This is administered primarily through the ward council 15Specifically it is intended in the new handbooks that bishops sensitive to existing demands will delegate more responsibilities Members need to recognize that the bishop has been instructed to delegate Members need to sustain and support him as he follows this counsel This will allow the bishop to spend more time with the youth young single adults and his own family He will delegate other important responsibilities to priesthood leaders presidents of auxiliaries and individual men and women In the Church the role of women in the home is highly respected 16 When the mother receives a Church calling that requires significant time the father will often be given a less demanding calling in order to maintain balance in the lives of the family Several years ago I attended a stake conference in Tonga Sunday morning the three front rows of the chapel were filled with men between 26 and 35 years of age I assumed they were a men s choir But when the business of the conference was conducted each of these men 63 in total stood up as their names were read and were sustained for ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood I was both pleased and stunned After the session I asked President Mateaki the stake president how this miracle had been accomplished He told me that in a stake council meeting reactivation was being discussed His stake Relief Society president Sister Leinata Va enuku asked if it would be appropriate for her to say something As she spoke the Spirit confirmed to the president that what she was suggesting was true She explained that there were large numbers of wonderful young men in their late 20s and 30s in their stake who had not served missions She said many of them knew they had disappointed bishops and priesthood leaders who had strongly encouraged them to serve a mission and they now felt like second class members of the Church She pointed out that these young men were beyond missionary age She expressed her love and concern for them She explained that all of the saving ordinances were still available to them and the focus should be on priesthood ordinations and the ordinances of the temple She noted that while some of these young men were still single the majority of them had married wonderful women some active some inactive and some not members After thorough discussion in the stake council it was decided that the men of the priesthood and the women of the Relief Society would reach out to rescue these men and their wives while the bishops spent more of their time with the young men and young women in the wards Those involved in the rescue focused primarily on preparing them for the priesthood eternal marriage and the saving ordinances of the temple During the next two years almost all of the 63 men who had been sustained to the Melchizedek Priesthood at the conference I attended were endowed in the temple and had their spouses sealed to them This account is but one example of how critical our sisters are in the work of salvation in our wards and stakes and how they facilitate revelation especially in family and Church councils 17Role of Sisters in the FamilyWe recognize that there are enormous forces arrayed against women and families Recent studies find there is deterioration in devotion to marriage with a decrease in the number of adults being married 18 For some marriage and family are becoming a menu choice rather than the central organizing principle of our society 19 Women are confronted with many options and need to prayerfully consider the choices they make and how those choices affect the family When I was in New Zealand last year I read in an Auckland newspaper of women not of our faith struggling with these issues One mother said she realized that in her case her choice about whether to work or stay home was about a new carpet and a second car that she didn t really need Another woman however felt the biggest enemy of a happy family life was not paid work it was television She said that families are TV rich and family time poor 20These are very emotional personal decisions but there are two principles that we should always keep in mind First no woman should ever feel the need to apologize or feel that her contribution is less significant because she is devoting her primary efforts to raising and nurturing children Nothing could be more significant in our Father in Heaven s plan Second we should all be careful not to be judgmental or assume that sisters are less valiant if the decision is made to work outside the home We rarely understand or fully appreciate people s circumstances Husbands and wives should prayerfully counsel together understanding they are accountable to God for their decisions You devoted sisters who are single parents for whatever reason our hearts reach out to you with appreciation Prophets have made it clear that many hands stand ready to help you The Lord is not unmindful of you Neither is His Church 21 I would hope that Latter day Saints would be at the forefront in creating an environment in the workplace that is more receptive and accommodating to both women and men in their responsibilities as parents You valiant and faithful single sisters please know that we love and appreciate you and we assure you that no eternal blessing will be withheld from you The remarkable pioneer woman Emily H Woodmansee penned the text of the hymn As Sisters in Zion She correctly asserts that the errand of angels is given to women 22 This has been described as nothing less than to do the direct and immediate bidding of our Father in Heaven and this is a gift that sisters claim 23Dear sisters we love and admire you We appreciate your service in the Lord s kingdom You are incredible I express particular appreciation for the women in my life I testify of the reality of the Atonement the divinity of the Savior and the Restoration of His Church in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
I celebrated a birthday last month For my birthday present my wife Mary gave me a CD containing songs of hope and faith performed by a famous British singer named Vera Lynn who inspired her listeners during the dark days of the Second World War There is a little history as to why my wife would give me this gift The bombing of London in September 1940 commenced the day before I was born 1 My mother listening to the account of the London Blitz on the radio in her hospital room decided to name me after the radio announcer whose first name was Quentin The vocalist Vera Lynn is now 93 years old Last year some of her wartime songs were rereleased and immediately climbed to the top of the music charts in Britain Those of you who are a little older will remember some of the songs like The White Cliffs of Dover One song titled When the Lights Go on Again All over the World deeply touched me The song brought two thoughts to my mind first the prophetic words by a British statesman The lamps are going out all over Europe We shall not see them lit again in our time 2 and second the bombing raids conducted over British cities like London To make it harder for the attacking bombers to find a target blackouts were instituted Lights were turned out and windows were draped The song reflected an optimistic hope that freedom and light would be restored For those of us who understand the role of the Savior and the Light of Christ3 in the ongoing conflict between good and evil the analogy between that world war and the moral conflict today is clear It is by the Light of Christ that all mankind may know good from evil 4Freedom and light have never been easy to attain or maintain Since the War in Heaven the forces of evil have used every means possible to destroy agency and extinguish light The assault on moral principles and religious freedom has never been stronger As Latter day Saints we need to do our best to preserve light and protect our families and communities from this assault on morality and religious freedom Protecting FamilyAn ever present danger to the family is the onslaught of evil forces that seem to come from every direction While our primary effort must be to seek light and truth we would be wise to black out from our homes the lethal bombs that destroy spiritual development and growth Pornography in particular is a weapon of mass moral destruction Its impact is at the forefront in eroding moral values Some TV programs and Internet sites are equally lethal These evil forces remove light and hope from the world The level of decadence is accelerating 5 If we do not black out evil from our homes and lives do not be surprised if devastating moral explosions shatter the peace which is the reward for righteous living Our responsibility is to be in the world but not of the world In addition we need to greatly increase religious observance in the home Weekly family home evening and daily family prayer and scripture study are essential We need to introduce into our homes content that is virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy 6 If we make of our homes holy places that shelter us from evil we will be protected from the adverse consequences that the scriptures have foretold Protecting CommunityIn addition to protecting our own families we should be a source of light in protecting our communities The Savior said Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven 7Our day has been described as a time of plenty and an age of doubt 8 Basic belief in the power and authority of God is not only questioned but also denigrated How under these circumstances can we promote values in a way that will resonate with the nonbelievers and the apathetic and help abate the spiraling descent into violence and evil This question is of monumental importance Think of the prophet Mormon and his anguish when he declared How could ye have rejected that Jesus who stood with open arms to receive you 9 Mormon s anguish was justified and his son Moroni was left to describe the sad tale of the destruction of his people 10My personal experience of living and interacting with people all over the world has caused me to be optimistic I believe that light and truth will be preserved in our time In all nations there are large numbers who worship God and feel accountable to Him for their conduct Some observers believe there is actually a global revival of faith 11 As Church leaders we have met with leaders of other faiths and have found that there is a common moral foundation that transcends theological differences and unites us in our aspirations for a better society We also find the majority of people are still respectful of basic moral values But make no mistake there are also people who are determined to both destroy faith and reject any religious influence in society Other evil people exploit manipulate and tear down society with drugs pornography sexual exploitation human trafficking robbery and dishonest business practices The power and influence of these people is very large even if they are relatively small in number There has always been an ongoing battle between people of faith and those who would purge religion and God from public life 12 Many opinion leaders today reject a moral view of the world based on Judeo Christian values In their view there is no objective moral order 13 They believe no preference should be given to moral goals 14Still the majority of people aspire to be good and honorable The Light of Christ which is distinct from the Holy Ghost informs their conscience We know from the scriptures that the Light of Christ is the Spirit which giveth light to every man that cometh into the world 15 This light is given for the sake of the whole world 16 President Boyd K Packer has taught that this is a source of inspiration which each of us possesses in common with all other members of the human family 17 This is why many will accept moral values even when founded on religious convictions which they do not personally support As we read in Mosiah in the Book of Mormon It is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right Mosiah then warns If the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity then is the time that the judgments of God will come 18In our increasingly unrighteous world it is essential that values based on religious belief be part of the public discourse Moral positions informed by a religious conscience must be accorded equal access to the public square Under the constitutions of most countries a religious conscience may not be given preference but neither should it be disregarded 19Religious faith is a store of light knowledge and wisdom and benefits society in a dramatic way when adherents engage in moral conduct because they feel accountable to God 20Two religious principles will illustrate this point Honest Conduct Motivated by Accountability to GodThe thirteenth article of faith begins We believe in being honest Honesty is a principle founded in religious belief and is one of God s basic laws Many years ago when I was practicing law in California a friend and client who was not a member of our faith came in to see me and with great enthusiasm showed me a letter he had received from an LDS bishop of a nearby ward The bishop wrote that a member of his congregation a former employee of my client had taken materials from my client s work site and had rationalized that they were surplus But after becoming a committed Latter day Saint and attempting to follow Jesus Christ this employee recognized that what he had done was dishonest Enclosed in the letter was a sum of money from the man to cover not only the cost of the materials but also interest My client was impressed that the Church through lay leadership would assist this man in his effort to be reconciled to God Think about the light and truth that the shared value of honesty has in the Judeo Christian world Think about the impact on society if youth didn t cheat in school if adults were honest in the workplace and were faithful to their marriage vows For us the concept of basic honesty is grounded in the life and teachings of the Savior Honesty is also a valued attribute in many other faiths and in historic literature The poet Robert Burns said An honest man s the noblest work of God 21 In almost every instance people of faith feel accountable to God for being honest This was the reason the man in California was repenting from his earlier act of dishonesty In a commencement address last year Clayton Christensen a Harvard professor and Church leader shared the true account of a professional colleague from another country who had studied democracy This friend was surprised at how critically important religion is to democracy He pointed out that in societies where the citizens are taught from a young age to feel accountable to God for honesty and integrity they will abide by rules and practices that while unenforceable promote democratic ideals In societies where this is not true there cannot be enough policemen to enforce honest behavior 22Clearly moral values with respect to honesty can play a significant role in establishing light and truth and improving society and should be valued by those who do not have faith Treating All of God s Children as Brothers and SistersA second example of how religious faith benefits society and contributes light to the world is the role of religion in treating all of God s children as brothers and sisters Many faith based institutions in the last two centuries have been at the forefront in reaching out and rescuing those subjected to cruel circumstances because their members believe that all men are made in the image and likeness of God 23 William Wilberforce the great British statesman who was instrumental in outlawing the slave trade in Great Britain is an excellent example 24 Amazing Grace the touching hymn and the inspiring movie of the same name capture the feeling of the early 1800s and describe the account of his heroic effort Wilberforce s untiring efforts were among the first steps in eliminating this terrible oppressive cruel and venal practice As part of that effort he together with other leaders set out to reform public morality He believed that education and government had to be morally based 25 His vision of moral and spiritual enrichment was what he lived for whether in defending the institution of marriage attacking the practices of the slave trade or emphatically defending the Sabbath day 26 With great energy he helped mobilize the country s moral and social leaders in a nationwide struggle against vice 27In our early Church history the vast majority of our members were opposed to slavery 28 This was a significant reason along with their religious beliefs for the hostility and mob violence they experienced culminating in the extermination order issued by Governor Boggs in Missouri 29 In 1833 Joseph Smith received a revelation stating It is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another 30 Our commitment to freedom of religion and treating all people as sons and daughters of God is central to our doctrine These are just two examples of how faith based values undergird principles that greatly bless society There are many more We should both participate ourselves and support people of character and integrity to help reestablish moral values that will bless the entire community Let me be clear that all voices need to be heard in the public square Neither religious nor secular voices should be silenced Furthermore we should not expect that because some of our views emanate from religious principles they will automatically be accepted or given preferential status But it is also clear such views and values are entitled to be reviewed on their merits The moral foundation of our doctrine can be a beacon light to the world and can be a unifying force for both morality and faith in Jesus Christ We need to protect our families and be at the forefront together with all people of goodwill in doing everything we can to preserve light hope and morality in our communities If we both live and proclaim these principles we will be following Jesus Christ who is the true Light of the World We can be a force for righteousness in preparing for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ We look forward to that beautiful day when free hearts will sing when the lights go on again all over the world 31 In the sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
It is a significant responsibility to speak on Easter Sunday to Latter day Saints across the world who love our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ We celebrate this morning His victory over death We cherish our understanding and feel heartfelt appreciation for the Savior s willing atoning sacrifice on our behalf His acquiescence to the will of His Father won the supernal victory over death and is the transcendent event in the history of mankind I appreciate this opportunity to speak about following the Savior The final two days of the Savior s mortal ministry prior to His Crucifixion are profoundly important and in some ways beyond comprehension So much of what is essential to our eternal destiny occurred on Thursday and then Friday the day Christ was crucified The Last Supper a Passover supper the established memorial of Israel s deliverance from bondage was commenced Thursday evening 1 Ordinances and doctrines of great importance were initiated at the Last Supper I will mention just three First the Savior introduced the ordinance of the sacrament He took bread broke it prayed over it and passed it to His disciples saying This is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me 2 In this manner He instituted the sacrament Second His overwhelming emphasis was on doctrines teaching love as a preeminent principle He taught By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another 3 Third through Christ s intercession or direction the Holy Ghost was promised to the apostles as another Comforter 4The Savior subsequently accomplished the Atonement He took upon Himself the burden of the sins of mankind and the horrors that Satan could inflict 5 In this process He endured the fraudulently concocted trials and the terrible tragic events leading to His Crucifixion This ultimately culminated in Christ s triumphant Resurrection on Easter Sunday Christ fulfilled His sacred mission as Savior and Redeemer We will be resurrected from death and have our spirits reunited with our bodies Based on personal worthiness we may through His grace have the glorious opportunity of entering back into the presence of God 6The Prophet Joseph Smith speaking of these Easter events said The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ that He died was buried and rose again the third day and ascended into heaven and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it 7While we rejoice in the supernal significance of Gethsemane and Calvary our focus has always been on the resurrected Lord Frederic Farrar the English theologian and believer testified that the earliest generation of believers in the primitive Christian Church celebrated the Savior as the Risen the Eternal the Glorified Christ and contemplated Him not as on the Cross but as on the Throne 8President Gordon B Hinckley taught that our message to the world is that He lives The symbol of Christ for the Latter day Saints will be found in the meaningful expression of our faith and the way we live His gospel 9As we ponder what it means to be Christians today think about what our path of discipleship will require of us I suggest that we contemplate and in appropriate ways emulate what the Savior did in those last two days of His mortal life First consider the Savior s introduction of the sacrament The Savior knew what was about to befall Him His sacred atoning mission beginning with the War in Heaven in the premortal existence was about to unfold that evening and the next day Yet with the trials by His adversaries imminently before Him there is not the slightest evidence He was preparing a defense against the untrue accusations The Savior instead introduced the sacred ordinance of the sacrament to His disciples As I contemplate that solemn occasion my feelings are deeply touched Sacrament meeting is the most sacred and holy of all the meetings in the Church After His Resurrection the Savior instituted the sacrament among the Nephites 10 If we are to be His disciples and to be committed members of His Church we must remember and reverence the sacrament It allows each of us to express with broken hearts and contrite spirits our willingness to follow the Savior to repent and to become a Saint through the Atonement of Christ 11 The sacrament allows us to witness to God that we will remember His Son and keep His commandments as we renew our baptismal covenant 12 This increases our love and appreciation for both the Father and the Son The Savior also emphasized love and unity and declared that we would be known as His disciples if we have love one to another In the face of the eternity shaping Atonement He was about to undertake such a commandment requires our obedience We manifest our love for God when we keep His commandments and serve His children We don t fully comprehend the Atonement but we can spend our lives trying to be more loving and kind regardless of the adversity we face The Savior s charge to His disciples to love one another and the dramatic and powerful way He taught this principle at the Last Supper is one of the most poignant and beautiful episodes from the last days of His mortal life He was not teaching a simple class in ethical behavior This was the Son of God pleading with His Apostles and all disciples who would come after them to remember and follow this most central of His teachings How we relate and interact with each other is a measure of our willingness to follow Jesus Christ As we listen to the messages of this conference we will be touched in our hearts and make resolutions and commitments to do better But on Monday morning we will return to work school neighborhoods and to a world that in many cases is in turmoil Many in this world are afraid and angry with one another While we understand these feelings we need to be civil in our discourse and respectful in our interactions This is especially true when we disagree The Savior taught us to love even our enemies 13 The vast majority of our members heed this counsel Yet there are some who feel that venting their personal anger or deeply held opinions is more important than conducting themselves as Jesus Christ lived and taught I invite each one of us individually to recognize that how we disagree is a real measure of who we are and whether we truly follow the Savior It is appropriate to disagree but it is not appropriate to be disagreeable Violence and vandalism are not the answer to our disagreements If we show love and respect even in adverse circumstances we become more like Christ The Savior s promise of the Holy Ghost to the Apostles is of supreme importance in recognizing the preeminent role of the Holy Ghost the third member of the Godhead The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit the Comforter who bears witness of the Father and the Son reveals the truth of all things and sanctifies those who have repented and been baptized He is referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise and as such confirms as acceptable to God the righteous acts ordinances and covenants of each of us 14 They who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has 15We live in a noisy contentious world where it is possible to be viewing or listening to information music or even pure nonsense virtually every waking hour If we want to have the inspiration of the Holy Ghost we must find time to slow down ponder pray and live so we are worthy to receive and act upon His promptings We will avoid major mistakes if we heed His warnings It is our privilege as members to receive light and knowledge from Him even to the perfect day 16The atoning trials the Savior faced in Gethsemane and on the cross are a great example to us He faced mental physical and spiritual afflictions that are beyond our comprehension In the garden He prayed to His Father saying O my Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt 17 As His disciples there will be times when we will be tried and persecuted unjustly and mocked unfairly and face temporal and spiritual storms of a magnitude that will seem unbearable to us and experience bitter cups that we pray would pass from us No one is exempt from the storms of life We are preparing for the Second Coming of the Savior The scriptures are clear that no one knows when this will occur The scriptures do tell us that in the last days among the bitter cups we will face there will be earthquakes in divers places 18 and the waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds 19Devastating earthquakes and tsunamis have recently occurred in diverse places including Chile Haiti and the islands of the Pacific A few weeks ago Presiding Bishop H David Burton Elder Tad R Callister and I were able to meet with the Saints who had lost family members as a result of the tsunami that hit the eastern side of Samoa last September The chapel was full and it was an emotional meeting We were able to assure these choice members that because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ they can be reunited with the loved ones they have lost The stake president Sonny Purcell was driving his car when he saw the enormous wave coming far out at sea He honked his horn and stopped children on the road walking to school and warned them to run for higher ground and safety as fast as they could The children followed his instruction He frantically drove reached his four year old daughter put her in the car and then tried to get to his mother Before he could reach his mother the wall of water picked up his car and swept it over 100 yards 91 m where it lodged in a tree He scrambled to secure his daughter on top of the car and then swam to rescue his mother who was clinging to a branch of another tree near their house With great effort he swam with her to the car and safety Many were not as fortunate They did not have time to get to higher ground and safety Many lost their lives particularly the young and the elderly We told the Samoan families that members all over the world expressed love and concern and had prayed for them and contributed fast offerings and humanitarian aid for both the members and their neighbors The same is true for the members and their neighbors in Chile and Haiti We do this because we follow Jesus Christ As we met with the families in Samoa the significance of spiritually going to the higher ground living a better life and clinging to saving ordinances was abundantly clear The Savior s example and life teach us to spiritually avoid the low pathway where the things of this world dominate As I shook hands with the members after our meeting one sister told me her family had not been to the temple and they had lost a daughter She tearfully said their goal now was to prepare themselves for the sacred ordinances of the temple so they can be together eternally As I have pondered what this sister said and the current condition of the world I have felt an urgency to counsel each of us to seek the higher ground the refuge and eternal protection of the temple On Easter Sunday April 3 1836 one week after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple the Twelve officiated in distributing the sacrament of the Lord s Supper to the members After the meeting following solemn and silent prayer the Savior appeared in majesty to the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery and through Moses Elias and Elijah ushered in the restoration of additional priesthood keys including the sacred sealing power that unites families throughout eternity 20Today on this Easter morning we rejoice in all the Savior has done for us He has made it possible for each of us to gain our salvation and exaltation But we like the Samoan children must run as fast as we can to the high ground He has provided for safety and peace One of the ways we do this is by adhering to the teachings of our living prophet President Thomas S Monson He is an excellent example of one who follows the Savior On this glorious Easter morning I resonate with the treasured words penned by Eliza R Snow a faithful servant in the Restoration How great how glorious how complete Redemption s grand design Where justice love and mercy meetIn harmony divine 21I bear my apostolic witness that Jesus Christ lives and is the Savior and Redeemer of the world He has provided the pathway to true happiness Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
We live in perilous times when many believe we are not accountable to God and that we do not have personal responsibility or stewardship for ourselves or others Many in the world are focused on self gratification put themselves first and love pleasure more than they love righteousness They do not believe they are their brother s keeper In the Church however we believe that these stewardships are a sacred trust Recently a group of highly respected Jewish leaders and rabbis visited Church facilities in the Salt Lake Valley including Welfare Square the Humanitarian Center the Family History Library and the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple open house At the conclusion of their visit one of the most eminent rabbis in America expressed his feelings about what he had seen and felt 1He cited concepts from Jewish thinkers rooted in the Talmud2 and pointed out that there are two very different reasons people engage in acts of kindness and generosity Some people visit the sick assist the poor and serve their fellowmen because they believe it is the right thing to do and others will reciprocate and do the same for them when they are in need He explained that while this is good builds caring communities and should be considered a noble reason a higher motive is when we serve our fellowmen because that is what we believe God wants us to do He stated that as a result of his visit he believed the Latter day Saints undertake welfare and humanitarian efforts and the work of salvation in our temples in order to do what we believe God wants us to do This feeling of accountability which is encompassed by the first great commandment to love God has been described by some as obedience to the unenforceable 3 We try to do what is right because we love and want to please our Father in Heaven not because someone is forcing us to obey The War in Heaven was fought after Satan said that he would force everyone to obey his ideas That was rejected As a result we have our moral agency and the freedom to choose our course in this life But we also are accountable for that agency The Lord has said we will be accountable for our own sins in the day of judgment 4 The principles of accountability and stewardship have great significance in our doctrine 5In the Church stewardship is not limited to a temporal trust or responsibility President Spencer W Kimball taught We are stewards over our bodies minds families and properties A faithful steward is one who exercises righteous dominion cares for his own and looks to the poor and needy 6While there are many areas of stewardship I have chosen to address two The first is stewardship of ourselves and our families The second is stewardship for the poor and needy The Lord often used parables relating to the land in teaching accountability and stewardship When I was a small boy I would visit my grandparents at their ranch during the summer There was no electrical power running water or indoor plumbing There was however a spring of water next to their small ranch house The spring created a little pond of clear pure water where several times a day I would help my grandmother carry water to the house for drinking cooking bathing and washing clothes My grandparents loved this life giving spring and took special precautions to protect it Many years later my grandfather was in his early 90s and did not live on the property he was unable to maintain or oversee it I drove him to see the ranch which he loved His high expectations at seeing the ranch turned to disappointment when he realized the fences that protected the spring had fallen into disrepair and cows had damaged the spring and the precious pure springwater had been significantly polluted He was upset with the damage and the pollution To him it was a violation of a trust he had observed all his working life He felt somehow he had not protected that life sustaining spring which had meant so much to him Just as the pure spring was polluted when not protected we live in a time when virtue and chastity are not safeguarded 7 The eternal significance of personal morality is not respected A loving Father in Heaven has provided us with the means to bring His spirit children into this world to fulfill the full measure of their creation He has instructed us that the wellsprings of life are to be kept pure just as the beautiful spring on the ranch required protection in order to sustain life This is one of the reasons why virtue and chastity are so important in our Father in Heaven s plan Because of my grandfather s reaction to the polluted spring improvements and protections were undertaken which returned the spring to its original beauty and purity As servants of the Lord Jesus Christ it is our sacred responsibility to teach His standard of morality which is the same for all of His children When our thoughts or our actions are impure we violate His standard The Lord has said I cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance 8 Some attempt to rationalize away their conduct In a poem by John Holmes titled Talk an old deaf New England shipbuilder teaches a young man about rationalization In describing one of the lessons he learned the youth explains I wouldn t have known that however you build it the ship must sail you can t explain to the ocean 9It has been suggested that what happens in a certain city stays in a certain city I like the sign posted in Sevier County Utah which states What happens in Sevier County you can share with your friends When we realize that we are accountable to God we see how foolish rationalizations can be Those who rationalize remind us of little children who cover their eyes convinced that if they can t see us we can t see them I would suggest that if we think about giving an accounting of our actions to the Savior our rationalizations will be seen in their true light We are aware that there are those who have already engaged in conduct inconsistent with this sacred standard of morality Please understand that through the Savior s Atonement all can repent and return like the spring of water to a clean and pure state It is difficult to repent it requires a broken heart and a contrite spirit 10 But when the steps to repentance are righteously followed the words spoken by the prophet Alma to his son Corianton who had been involved in moral transgressions are applicable And now my son I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more and only let your sins trouble you with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance 11 The Savior has said Behold he who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and I the Lord remember them no more 12With respect to our stewardship for our families some have taught that when we report to the Savior and He asks us to give an account of our earthly responsibilities two important inquiries will relate to our families The first will be our relationship with our spouse and the second will be about each of our children 13It is easy to confuse our priorities We have a duty to secure the physical safety and well being of our children However some parents place undue priority on temporal and material possessions Some are far less diligent in their efforts to immerse their children in the gospel of Jesus Christ 14 Remember that having religious observance in the home is as important as providing food clothing and shelter Parents can also help children discover and develop their talents We are responsible for the talents we have received Children who are not taught that they are accountable for their time and talents are increasingly subject to the foolishness and unrighteousness that are so pervasive in the world 15 The family proclamation warns that individuals who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God 16The second stewardship is caring for the poor and those in need which applies to virtually all of us at one time or another The Lord s admonition that we are stewards for those in need contains some of the strongest language in all of scripture If any man shall take of the abundance which I have made and impart not his portion unto the poor and the needy he shall with the wicked lift up his eyes in hell being in torment 17 We are accountable as stewards over earthly blessings which the Lord has provided The Jewish leaders I mentioned earlier were particularly impressed with the principle of fasting and then paying a generous fast offering They thought it was remarkable that Church members across the world would fast monthly and then make a freewill offering for the benefit of those who are in need When the rabbis visited Welfare Square they were touched to learn that even in difficult economic times our members concerned about the challenges experienced by many continue to donate generously to help the poor and needy I can remember when I was called as a bishop my predecessor Bishop Russell Johnson warned me that I would have to be careful what I asked the members to do He said Some will respond to every suggestion even at great sacrifice He mentioned one widow in her 80s who had cared for both a husband and a son through long illnesses before they passed away Bishop Johnson said that despite having small resources she would always try to respond I found this to be true Every time I mentioned the need for contributions or service to bless others Sarah was often the first to respond One Saturday another sister called me and said Bishop come quick Save Sarah This sister reported that 80 year old Sarah was on top of a ladder cleaning out this neighbor s rain gutters This sister was terrified that Sarah would fall and wanted the bishop to intervene I am not suggesting that everyone can or should imitate Sarah Some feel guilty because they cannot meet every need immediately I love the quote Elder Neal A Maxwell often used from Anne Morrow Lindbergh My life cannot implement in action the demands of all the people to whom my heart responds 18 King Benjamin taught See that all these things are done in wisdom and order for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength 19 But he added that we should be diligent My heart rejoices as I observe the Saints all over the Church doing everything they can to provide Christlike service wherever there is a need Because of member contributions the Church can quietly and quickly without fanfare respond to needs all over the world 20 The Church is already responding to the natural disasters in the Philippines the Pacific Islands and Indonesia Last year our members responded to Hurricane Gustav The Church worked closely with a humanitarian organization led by Martin Luther King III Mr King subsequently visited Salt Lake City and said I originally came to express my appreciation to the Church for their humanitarian support but I quickly learned that the essence of who you are is so much deeper and profound Between the Humanitarian Center Welfare Square and the temple open house I now have a greater appreciation for why you do what you do In all of our stewardship efforts we follow Jesus Christ We try to emulate what He has asked us to do both by His teachings and His example With all our hearts we express our appreciation to the membership of the Church for their generous contributions and Christlike service Isaiah speaking of the fast and feeding the hungry and clothing the naked in touching language promised Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer 21 Isaiah continues And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul the Lord shall guide thee continually and thou shalt be like a spring of water whose waters fail not And thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations 22My hope is that each of us will review individually and as families the stewardships for which we have responsibility and accountability I pray that we will do so knowing we are ultimately accountable to God and that in this life we will be adhering to the unenforceable I am grateful for the counsel of a loving faithful prophet to serve and rescue those in need As we follow his counsel I know we will qualify for the Lord s promise And whoso is found a faithful a just and a wise steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord and shall inherit eternal life 23I bear my witness of this sacred truth in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
This mortal life can constitute a difficult journey but the destination is truly glorious Christ expressed this to His disciples These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 1My objective this afternoon is twofold first to address some stumbling blocks to faith and second to describe how our Father s plan is big enough for all His children During the past two years in the United States and across the world there has been a dramatic increase in the discussion of our faith and beliefs This is not new it has happened periodically throughout the history of the Church In 1863 Charles Dickens the English novelist went on board the passenger ship Amazon which was bound for New York His purpose was to report on the Latter day Saint converts who were emigrating to build up the Church in the American West There had been thousands of converts who had already emigrated and much had been written particularly in the British media about them and their beliefs Most of what was written was unfavorable I went on board their ship wrote Dickens to bear testimony against them if they deserved it as I fully believed they would to my great astonishment they did not deserve it 2After observing and mingling with the converts Dickens was impressed with them and described these English converts most of whom were laborers as being in their degree the pick and flower of England 3There have been two contrasting reports with respect to the Church On one hand righteous members and the way they live their lives have generally been reported on favorably Those who know Latter day Saints personally or have the opportunity to observe them up close have the same view that Charles Dickens reported almost 150 years ago Because of the uplifting doctrine of the Restoration members rejoice in the gospel and find joy and satisfaction in the Church We are viewed favorably when we live the teachings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ When members don t live the teachings it can be a stumbling block to those who do not belong to the Church 4Unlike the favorable reports on righteous members descriptions of the Church and its doctrine have often been untrue unfair and harsh It should be acknowledged that some descriptions of Christianity in general have also been very harsh 5This attitude toward our doctrine does not come as a surprise In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord indicated that there would be some who lift up their voices and curse God 6 and some turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men 7Recent bus ads in London demonstrate the polarization that exists concerning religion in general Some atheists agnostics and nonbelievers paid to display large posters on red double decker buses in London that said There s probably no God Now stop worrying and enjoy your life Opposing ads by Christians asserted There definitely is a God followed by uplifting messages 8Nonbelievers find it hard to accept the miracles of the Old and New Testaments and the Savior s virgin birth and Resurrection They view these events with the same skepticism as the appearance of God the Father and Jesus Christ to the Prophet Joseph Smith They are not open to the possibility of a heavenly plan presided over by a supreme being They do not have faith 9My principal concern is for the honorable people on the earth who are open to religious faith but have been discouraged or confused by incorrect doctrine For instance with respect to the doctrine that revelation still exists some very good people have been confident that the Church could not be true because they have been taught and therefore believe that the heavens are closed and there will be no additional revelation no scripture and no pronouncements from heaven Let me emphasize that this widely held belief is not scriptural but it is a stumbling block to some 10In a recent best selling book the author uses as his principal analogy the interesting fact that for centuries all Europeans believed that all swans were white It wasn t until the discovery of Australia that swans of a different color were discovered The author uses this analogy to help explain events which have actually occurred but were not expected 11 As I thought about this analogy I realized that many people have refused to seriously investigate the Church because they believe there can be no revelation in this dispensation One convert who is now serving as a mission president describes how difficult this was for him when he was investigating the Church He said I had been taught all my life that there would never again be prophets and apostles here upon the earth So to accept Joseph Smith as a prophet created a large stumbling block However when he prayed he states I received a witness that in fact the gospel had been restored to the earth and that Joseph Smith was truly a prophet of God 12For many of these people who are open to religious faith one issue has been particularly troubling They have had a difficult time reconciling the correct doctrine that we have a loving Father in Heaven and the incorrect doctrine that most of mankind would be doomed to eternal hell This was an issue with my great great grandfather Phineas Wolcott Cook He was born in 1820 in Connecticut In his diary he notes that he had made a covenant with the Lord to serve Him if he could find the right way He attended many churches and at one was asked to testify and join the church and be a Christian His response was he could not tell which one to join there were so many He continued to investigate several churches One doctrine was of particular significance to him He explained Sometimes they found fault with me because I wanted a more liberal salvation for the family of man I could not believe the Lord had made a part to be saved and a great part to be damned to all eternity 13 Because of this doctrine he allowed his name to be taken off the records of one Protestant religion When the LDS missionaries taught him the true doctrine of the plan of salvation in 1844 he was baptized Phineas s faith in the loving mercy of the Lord and His plan of happiness has been shared by many honorable men and women even when the teachings of their own churches were very bleak The Anglican church leader and classical scholar Frederic Farrar the author of The Life of Christ lamented in lectures in Westminster Abbey that the common teachings of the Protestant churches with respect to hell were incorrect He asserted that a definition of hell which included endless torment and everlasting damnation was the result of translation errors from Hebrew and Greek to English in the King James Version of the Bible Farrar also noted the overwhelming demonstration of a loving Father in Heaven throughout the Bible as additional evidence that the definitions of hell and damnation used in the English translation were incorrect 14Lord Tennyson in his poem In Memoriam expressed his heartfelt sentiment after noting that we trust that somehow good will be the final goal of ill He continued That nothing walks with aimless feet That not one life shall be destroy d Or cast as rubbish to the void When God hath made the pile complete 15At the time Joseph Smith received revelations and organized the Church the vast majority of churches taught that the Savior s Atonement would not bring about the salvation of most of mankind The common precept was that a few would be saved and the overwhelming majority would be doomed to endless tortures of the most awful and unspeakable intensity 16 The marvelous doctrine revealed to the Prophet Joseph unveiled to us a plan of salvation that is applicable to all mankind including those who do not hear of Christ in this life children who die before the age of accountability and those who have no understanding 17At death righteous spirits live in a temporary state called paradise Alma the Younger teaches us paradise is a state of rest a state of peace where the righteous shall rest from all their troubles and from all care and sorrow 18 The unrighteous spirits dwell in spirit prison sometimes referred to as hell 19 It is described as an awful place a dark place where those fearful of the indignation of the wrath of God shall remain until the resurrection 20 However because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ all spirits blessed by birth will ultimately be resurrected spirit and body reunited and inherit kingdoms of glory that are superior to our existence here on earth 21 The exceptions are confined to those who like Satan and his angels willfully rebel against God 22 At the resurrection the spirit prison or hell will deliver up its captive spirits Jesus came into the world to be crucified for the world and to bear the sins of the world and to sanctify the world and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness 23The Savior said Let not your heart be troubled In my Father s house are many mansions I go to prepare a place for you 24 A succinct summary is provided in the book of Moses For behold this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man 25After all the Savior has suffered for mankind it is not surprising that in speaking of existing churches in the First Vision He would instruct Joseph to join none of them for they were all wrong 26 The Savior subsequently ushered in the Restoration of His true doctrine with respect to the plan of salvation and other saving principles such as the doctrine of Christ 27But notwithstanding the significance of our doctrinal differences with other faiths our attitude toward other churches has been to refrain from criticism They do much good They bless mankind Many help their members learn of the Savior and His teachings A reporter for the Washington Post visited one of our Church meetings in Nigeria The reporter interviewed one new member and told of his conversion The reporter states He said he jumped off a city bus and walked into the LDS Church building He immediately liked what he heard inside the chapel especially that no one preached that people of other faiths were going to hell 28 This echoes the feeling of numerous converts to the Church since its organization Our leaders have consistently counseled us to live with respect and appreciation for those not of our faith There is so great a need for civility and mutual respect among those of differing beliefs and philosophies 29It is equally important that we be loving and kind to members of our own faith regardless of their level of commitment or activity The Savior has made it clear that we are not to judge each other 30 This is especially true of members of our own families Our obligation is to love and teach and never give up The Lord has made salvation free for all men but has commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance 31The desire of our hearts of course is not only to acquire salvation and immortality but also to attain eternal life with a loving Father in Heaven and our Savior in the celestial kingdom with our families We can obtain eternal life only through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel 32 The Savior said For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness and be glorified in me 33Those early European converts that Dickens met on board the ship Amazon had overcome many stumbling blocks They had a testimony that revelation comes from heaven and that prophets and apostles are again on the earth They had faith in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ They had come to understand the sublime destination that was in store for them They were not fearful of the arduous journey they were undertaking and their ultimate destination was not really the Salt Lake Valley Their true destination was paradise followed by exaltation in the celestial kingdom That is why Latter day Saints then and now sing the last verse of Come Come Ye Saints with faith and expectation And should we die before our journey s through Happy day All is well We then are free from toil and sorrow too With the just we shall dwell 34A loving Father has provided a comprehensive and compassionate plan for His children that saves the living redeems the dead rescues the damned and glorifies all who repent 35 Even though our journey may be fraught with tribulation the destination is truly glorious I rejoice in the great plan of salvation that is big enough for all of our Father in Heaven s children I express gratitude beyond my ability to articulate for the Atonement of Jesus Christ I bear my witness of Him in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Last winter my daughter had a white knuckle experience driving in a severe snowstorm She reminded me of a similar situation I had with my two sons many years ago My youngest son Joe was three years old and my son Larry was six We were traveling by car from San Francisco to Utah in June The weather had been very good As we started our ascent to the Donner Pass summit in the Sierra Nevada Mountains suddenly and without warning an enormous snowstorm hit us None of the drivers was prepared A semitruck in front of us had jackknifed and was spread across two lanes Other trucks and cars had slid off the freeway One lane was open and many vehicles including ours were desperately trying to gain traction to avoid the other vehicles All traffic then came to a halt We were not prepared for this blizzard in June We had no warm clothing and our fuel was relatively low I huddled with the two boys in an effort to keep us warm After many hours safety vehicles snowplows and tow trucks began to clear up the massive logjam of vehicles Eventually a tow truck hauled us to a service station on the other side of the pass I called my wife knowing she would be worried because she had expected a call the prior evening She asked if she could speak to the two boys When it was the three year old s turn with a quivering voice he said Hope ya know we had a hard time I could tell as our three year old talked to his mother and told her of the hard time he gained comfort and then reassurance Our prayers are that way when we go to our Father in Heaven We know He cares for us in our time of need Each of Us Will Face Trials and Hardships in This LifeThe incident I just recounted while a difficult travel situation was brief and there were no lasting consequences However many of the trials and hardships we encounter in life are severe and appear to have lasting consequences Each of us will experience some of these during the vicissitudes of life Many listening to this conference are experiencing situations of a most serious nature at this very moment We resonate with the Prophet Joseph s petition after he had been falsely accused and imprisoned in Liberty Jail for months O God where art thou And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place The Lord s answer is reassuring My son peace be unto thy soul thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment And then if thou endure it well God shall exalt thee on high 1One of the essential doctrines illuminated by the Restoration is that there must be opposition in all things for righteousness to be brought to pass 2 This life is not always easy nor was it meant to be it is a time of testing and proving As we read in Abraham And we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them 3 Elder Harold B Lee taught Sometimes the things that are best for us and the things that bring eternal rewards seem at the moment to be the most bitter and the things forbidden are ofttimes the things which seem to be the more desirable 4The novel A Tale of Two Cities opens with the oft quoted line It was the best of times it was the worst of times 5 The scriptures make it clear that each generation has its own version of best and worst of times We are all subject to the conflict between good and evil6 and the contrast between light and dark hope and despair As Elder Neal A Maxwell explained The sharp side by side contrast of the sweet and the bitter is essential until the very end of this brief mortal experience 7 We know from our doctrine that good will overcome evil 8 and those who repent and are sanctified shall be given eternal life 9Near the time Dickens was writing his novel the heroic efforts of the early Saints who settled the Intermountain West were occurring Even with their common faith the Saints had experienced much hardship and approached the evacuation of Nauvoo with very different expectations Some looked forward with optimism others with concern Two excellent examples are presented by Helen Mar Whitney and Bathsheba Smith Both have left compelling records of their feelings Sister Whitney recorded her expectations upon leaving Nauvoo I will pack away all my little ribbons collars and laces etc for we are going where we cannot purchase them We are going out from the world to live beyond the Rocky Mountains where none others will wish to go There will be neither rich nor poor among us and we will have none but the honest and virtuous 10 Sister Whitney s words resonate with an idealistic optimism Sister Bathsheba Smith s recorded feelings are also full of faith but evidence some trepidation She had seen the mobs arrayed against the Saints in Missouri and was present at the death of the Apostle David W Patten Recalling the evacuation of Nauvoo she wrote My last act in that precious spot was to tidy the rooms sweep up the floor and set the broom in its accustomed place behind the door Then with emotions in my heart I gently closed the door and faced an unknown future faced it with faith in God and with no less assurance of the ultimate establishment of the Gospel in the West and of its true enduring principles than I had felt in those trying scenes in Missouri 11Both of these LDS pioneer women remained strong in the gospel throughout their lives and provided wonderful service in building Zion but they faced many additional trials and hardships which they both faithfully endured 12 Despite Sister Whitney s optimism her first three children died at or near birth two of them during her extended exodus from Nauvoo to Salt Lake 13 Sister Whitney has blessed us with her writings in defense of our faith and was the mother of the Apostle Orson F Whitney Sister Smith recorded the poverty sickness and privation that the Saints suffered as they made their way west 14 In March of 1847 her mother passed away and the next month her second son John was born Her record of that is brief He was my last child and he lived only four hours 15 Later in her life she was the matron of the Salt Lake Temple and the fourth general president of the Relief Society We are deeply touched by the hardships that the early Saints endured Brigham Young captured this somewhat humorously in February 1856 when he stated I might say something with regard to the hard times You know that I have told you that if any one was afraid of starving to death let him leave and go where there is plenty I do not apprehend the least danger of starving for until we eat up the last mule from the tip of the ear to the end of the fly whipper I am not afraid of starving to death He went on to say There are many people who cannot now get employment but the spring is going to open upon us soon and we are not going to suffer any more than what is for our good 16The challenges we face today are in their own way comparable to challenges of the past The recent economic crisis has caused significant concern throughout the world Employment and financial problems are not unusual Many people have physical and mental health challenges Others deal with marital problems or wayward children Some have lost loved ones Addictions and inappropriate or harmful propensities cause heartache Whatever the source of the trials they cause significant pain and suffering for individuals and those who love them We know from the scriptures that some trials are for our good and are suited for our own personal development 17 We also know that the rain falls on the just and the unjust 18 It is also true that every cloud we see doesn t result in rain Regardless of the challenges trials and hardships we endure the reassuring doctrine of the Atonement wrought by Jesus Christ includes Alma s teaching that the Savior would take upon Him our infirmities and succor his people according to their infirmities 19The scriptures and modern prophets have made it clear that there will be lean years and plentiful years 20 The Lord expects us to be prepared for many of the challenges that come He proclaims If ye are prepared ye shall not fear 21 Part of the trauma I experienced crossing the Sierras in that blizzard many years ago occurred because I was not prepared for this sudden unexpected event One of the great blessings of the scriptures is that they warn us of challenges that are unexpected but often occur We would do well to be prepared for them One form of preparation is to keep the commandments In numerous places in the Book of Mormon the people were promised that they would prosper in the land if they would keep the commandments 22 This promise is often accompanied by the warning that if they do not keep the commandments of God they shall be cut off from His presence 23 Clearly having the blessings of the Spirit the ministration of the Holy Ghost is an essential element to truly prosper in the land and to be prepared Regardless of our trials with the abundance we have today we would be ungrateful if we did not appreciate our blessings Despite the obvious nature of the hardships the pioneers were experiencing President Brigham Young talked about the significance of gratitude He stated I do not know of any excepting the unpardonable sin that is greater than the sin of ingratitude 24Gratitude for the Savior and His AtonementOur foremost gratitude should be for the Savior and His Atonement We are aware that many who are listening to this conference are experiencing trials and hardships of such intensity that the underlying feeling in their hearts as they approach our Father in Heaven in prayer is Hope ya know I m having a hard time Let me share with you the true account of one sister Ellen Yates from Grantsville Utah Early in October 10 years ago she kissed her husband Leon good bye as he left to go to work in Salt Lake City This would be the last time she would see Leon alive He had a collision with a young man 20 years of age who was late for his first job and had tried to pass a slower vehicle resulting in a head on collision that killed them both instantly Sister Yates said that after two compassionate highway patrolmen told her the news she plunged into shock and grief She records As I tried to look ahead in life all I could see was darkness and pain It turned out that her husband s best friend was the bishop of the young man s ward The bishop called Sister Yates and told her that the young man s mother Jolayne Willmore wanted to talk with her She remembers being shocked because I was so centered on my grief and pain that I had not even thought about the young man and his family I suddenly realized that here was a mother who was in as much or more pain than I was I quickly gave my permission for a visit When Brother and Sister Willmore arrived they expressed their great sorrow that their son was responsible for Leon s death and presented her with a picture of the Savior holding a little girl in His arms Sister Yates says When times become too hard to bear I look at this picture and remember that Christ knows me personally He knows my loneliness and my trials One scripture that comforts Sister Yates is Wherefore be of good cheer and do not fear for I the Lord am with you and will stand by you 25Each October Sister Yates and Sister Willmore both of whom are here together in the Conference Center today go to the temple together and offer thanks for the Atonement of Jesus Christ for the plan of salvation for eternal families and for the covenants that bind together husbands and wives and families on both sides of the veil Sister Yates concludes Through this trial I have felt the love of my Father in Heaven and my Savior in greater abundance than I had ever felt before She testifies that there is no grief no pain no sickness so great that the Atonement of Christ and the love of Christ cannot heal 26 What a wonderful example of love and forgiveness these two sisters have demonstrated It has allowed the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be efficacious in their lives Think of the Savior in the Garden of Gethsemane during the Atonement process suffering agony so great that He bled from every pore 27 His cry to His Father included the word Abba 28 This might be interpreted as the cry of a son who is in distress to his father O my Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt 29 I testify that the Atonement of Jesus Christ covers all of the trials and hardships that any of us will encounter in this life At times when we may feel to say Hope you know I had a hard time we can be assured that He is there and we are safe in His loving arms When our beloved prophet President Thomas S Monson was asked on his birthday this past August what would be the ideal gift that members worldwide could give him he said without a moment s hesitation Find someone who is having a hard time and do something for them 30I with you am eternally grateful to Jesus Christ the rescuer of mankind I bear witness that He is the Savior and Redeemer of the world In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My dear brethren of the priesthood I am grateful to be with you at this session of general conference on this historic day We admire those who risk their lives to rescue those in danger 1 When I visited Southern California during the devastating Santa Ana wind fires late last year I came away with two impressions The first was how the Church members came to the assistance of those in need The second was how appreciative they were to the firefighters One homeowner described what he saw the firefighters do He pointed out that the Santa Ana winds blow from the warm desert toward the ocean Once a fire starts these hot desert winds carry the flames at a speed of up to 60 or 70 miles 97 113 km per hour The homeowner described his gratitude and admiration as he watched the firefighters standing with their hoses behind a cleared area facing a wall of fire up to 10 feet 3 m high descending upon them at this enormous speed These brave men and women were able to rescue both people and homes while in constant personal danger From time to time as individuals and as a church we go through periods of crisis and danger Some arise quickly like a fire Others are subtle and go almost undetected before they are upon us Some require heroic action but most are less spectacular The way we respond is crucial My purpose this evening is to reemphasize to priesthood holders the importance of heeding the words of the prophets This is one sure way to respond to physical and spiritual dangers of all kinds Some illustrations may be helpful Many of you have participated in treks to experience and appreciate the dramatic rescue of the Willie and Martin handcart companies I first became aware of this rescue when I was a teenager My mother gave me a book written by Orson F Whitney who would later be an Apostle 2 Elder Whitney s book acquainted me with the heroic effort directed by Brigham Young to rescue the handcart companies They had been overtaken by winter storms on the high plains of Wyoming Some had died and many others were on the verge of death Brigham Young became aware of their plight and at the October 1856 general conference he instructed the Saints to drop everything and rescue those stranded on the plains 3The response was dramatic Elder Whitney reported Brave men by their heroism for it was at the peril of their own lives that they thus braved the wintry storms on the plains immortalized themselves and won the undying gratitude of hundreds who were undoubtedly saved by their timely action from perishing 4One reason my mother had given me the book was Elder Whitney had made special mention of my great grandfather David Patten Kimball who had participated in the rescue when he was 17 years old All the rescuers battled deep snow and freezing temperatures during much of the rescue of the handcart companies At great personal sacrifice David and his associates helped carry many of the pioneers across the freezing ice filled Sweetwater 5This true account greatly impressed me I wanted to prove my devotion to the Lord through some dramatic act However in a visit with my grandfather he explained that when President Brigham Young sent his father David and the other young men on their rescue mission President Young instructed them to do everything they possibly could to save the handcart companies even at the peril of their own lives 6 Their acts of bravery were specifically to follow the prophet Brigham Young and by so doing express their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ My grandfather told me that consistent faithful dedication to the counsel of a prophet is the real lesson I should learn from my great grandfather s service As heroic as it was for David and his associates to help rescue the pioneers it is also valiant today to follow the counsel of our prophet An often told account from the Old Testament illustrates this principle Naaman a prominent leader in Syria was afflicted with leprosy He became aware that the prophet Elisha in Israel might be able to heal him Elisha sent word by a messenger that Naaman should wash himself in the river Jordan seven times Initially Naaman was upset with this counsel However his servants said If the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it Then Naaman followed the counsel of the prophet Elisha and he was made clean 7Like Naaman you young priesthood holders might aspire to do some great thing or participate in something dramatic like the handcart rescue However your resolve should be to follow the counsel of the prophet The First Presidency has reaffirmed its commitment to increasing the worthiness of young people who are recommended for missionary service Keeping yourselves free from the sins of the world and meeting the high standards for missionary service should be one goal Preparing yourselves to proclaim the gospel and rescue some of Heavenly Father s children spiritually would be both significant and heroic You can meet this challenge Throughout history a loving Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ who is the head of the Church have blessed us with prophets who counsel and warn about future dangers 8 In Doctrine and Covenants section 21 speaking specifically of the prophet the Lord declares Thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them walking in all holiness before me For his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith 9We have had the great privilege this morning in a solemn assembly to sustain President Thomas S Monson as our prophet seer and revelator and as the 16th President of the Church in this dispensation Later in this priesthood session of conference we will be blessed to hear his first general conference address as President of the Church We will want to sustain him with our hearts and our actions as we pay careful attention to what he teaches and what we feel My love and appreciation for our previous prophet President Gordon B Hinckley is planted deeply in my heart and will remain with me throughout the eternities But just as there is room in our hearts for all the children who come into our families we have that same love and devotion for each prophet the Lord calls to lead His Church Prophets are inspired to provide us with prophetic priorities to protect us from dangers As an example President Heber J Grant the prophet from 1918 to 1945 was inspired to emphasize adherence to the Word of Wisdom 10 the principle with a promise revealed by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph 11 He stressed the importance of not smoking or drinking alcoholic beverages and directed the bishops to review these principles in temple recommend interviews At that time smoking was accepted by society as an appropriate even glamorous behavior The medical profession accepted smoking with little concern because the scientific studies linking cigarette smoking with several kinds of cancer were far in the future President Grant counseled with great vigor and we became known as a people who abstained from drinking and smoking Starting in the late 1960s illegal drug use reached epidemic proportions throughout the world While there were some members who rebelled the vast majority of LDS youth were able to avoid the devastating use of drugs Obeying the Word of Wisdom gave our members especially our youth a preventive inoculation against drug use and the resulting health problems and moral hazards Unfortunately there appears to be a resurgence of drug use in our own day Living the Word of Wisdom today will free you from some of the most serious dangers you can face in this life Sometimes prophets teach us prophetic priorities that provide protection for us now and in the future As an example President David O McKay was the prophet from 1951 to 1970 One area of significant focus was his emphasis on the family He taught that no success in life can compensate for failure in the home 12 He encouraged members to strengthen families by increasing religious observance His teachings were a protection from the disintegration of the institution of marriage that came after his death 13 Because of President McKay s teaching the Latter day Saints strengthened their commitment to family and eternal marriage As the priesthood holders of the Church it is our solemn responsibility to follow our prophet We sustain President Monson and his counselors President Eyring and President Uchtdorf We want you young people to know that President Thomas S Monson has been prepared by the Lord from his youth to be the prophet 14 After serving in the navy at the close of World War II he was ordained as a bishop at age 22 and then served in a stake presidency At 32 years of age he served as a mission president in Canada with his sweetheart and companion Frances Monson He was called to be an Apostle by President McKay when he was only 36 years old He is the youngest man called as an Apostle in the past 98 years and has served for over 44 years The last 22 years he has served as a counselor to Presidents Ezra Taft Benson Howard W Hunter and Gordon B Hinckley 15Section 81 of the Doctrine and Covenants sets forth instructions to a counselor in the First Presidency It contains important priesthood principles The first instruction is to be faithful in counsel President Monson has faithfully counseled with each of the three prophets under whom he has served The unity of the First Presidency in all of their important decisions has been an example to all of us as priesthood holders in the exercise of Church government The second instruction is proclaiming the gospel President Monson has been a great missionary all his life His personal missionary effort his supervisory work of the Missionary Department and his calling and training of mission presidents have been undertaken with enthusiasm He made significant contributions to the new missionary guide Preach My Gospel In addition to valuable content contributions he inspired the inclusion of true accounts to make the guide come alive With his printer s eye he improved the design and layout He is indeed a great missionary The third instruction reads Wherefore be faithful stand in the office which I have appointed unto you succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees 16 Many of our brothers and sisters face devastating problems in their lives It is in our Christlike outreach to them that we as priesthood leaders parents friends and home teachers can be like the handcart company rescuers President Monson s rescue efforts in this regard have been particularly exemplary As a bishop he learned to minister to the members of his ward He has kept in touch with and served their children and grandchildren Despite a demanding schedule he was able to speak at the funerals of all 84 of the widows who lived in his ward when he was bishop He has reached out to those in need in a remarkable and personal way His long years of oversight of humanitarian efforts have blessed people all over the world both members and those not of our faith His personal ministry has been Christlike and has given comfort and peace to countless numbers of people One friend of mine who lost a grandson in a tragic accident told me that his grief was almost beyond comprehension President Monson s ministering to him turned almost overwhelming grief to the peace that surpasses understanding His effort to personally minister to those who are sick and afflicted has been extraordinary President Monson has done his very best to succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees He has magnified his calling as a counselor in the First Presidency in a remarkable way He has valiantly testified of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world which is the primary responsibility of all Apostles As the then junior member of the Twelve participating in my first reorganization of the First Presidency in an upper room of the Salt Lake Temple this past February I experienced the confirmation of the Spirit as the Twelve individually and unanimously sustained President Monson as the Lord s prophet and President of the Church I am grateful for our Father in Heaven who loves us and for His Son Jesus Christ who is our Savior and through the Atonement our ultimate rescuer from the physical and spiritual dangers of life He is our advocate with the Father Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters I join with you in expressing my love and sustaining support to President Eyring and his family President Hinckley extended this call to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve late Thursday afternoon I cannot possibly articulate the kaleidoscope of feelings I have experienced since then There have been sleepless nights and much prayer My spirits have been buoyed however by the knowledge that President Hinckley is the prophet and that the membership of the Church will be praying for me and my family To say that I feel deeply inadequate would be an understatement When I was called as a General Authority in April of 1996 I also felt unequal to the calling Elder Neal A Maxwell reassured me then that the most important qualification for all of us serving in the kingdom is to be comfortable in bearing witness of the divinity of the Savior A peace came over me at that time and has stayed with me since because I love the Savior and have had spiritual experiences that allow me to testify of Him I rejoice in the opportunity to bear witness of Jesus Christ in all the world see D C 107 23 notwithstanding my inadequacies In Doctrine and Covenants 68 verses 5 and 6 we read Behold this is the promise of the Lord unto you O ye my servants Wherefore be of good cheer and do not fear for I the Lord am with you and will stand by you and ye shall bear record of me even Jesus Christ that I am the Son of the living God that I was that I am and that I am to come I seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost as I speak with you this Sabbath morning The overwhelming feeling that I have in receiving this call is that we must live by faith and not by fear In 2 Timothy the Apostle Paul references the faith of Timothy s grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice Paul writes For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind 2 Timothy 1 7 In my own case I respectfully acknowledge ancestors now on the other side of the veil who gave everything asked of them to build the kingdom of God upon the earth I am grateful that all my life I have been surrounded by those who love the Savior My heart is full of appreciation for my family My wife Mary has been the joy of my life Her spiritual strength righteous example sense of humor and loving support have blessed me throughout my life Our three children and their spouses have been sources of great personal satisfaction and together with our nine grandchildren have been such a blessing to us Their faith and prayers and the goodness of their lives have been a great comfort to Mary and me When I think back to my youth in Logan Utah Elder Perry s fabled Cache Valley I realize how fortunate I was to be reared in a goodly home to have a righteous mother who was full of faith a loving father an older brother who has been an extraordinary example to me as well as a friend and counselor and a younger sister who has been loving and supportive How fortunate also to have had talented and devoted Church leaders teachers coaches and friends who were wonderful examples to me As a young man I had the opportunity to serve in the British Mission which was a seminal defining event in my life The influence of a valiant mission president is one of the great miracles of the restored gospel A few weeks ago I received a birthday card at Church headquarters from a woman I helped teach in Gloucester England many years ago I had lost contact with her She informed me that she and her husband are both very active members and have 6 children and 20 grandchildren all born in the covenant It may be the best birthday card I have ever received Mary and I left Utah so I could attend law school in Palo Alto California We were planning to return to Utah after graduation but the Spirit directed that we stay in California We lived in California for 33 years and raised our family there We both had many opportunities to serve We loved the diversity of the members and their commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ I will be eternally grateful for the wonderful Latter day Saints in California who have been such a positive influence in my life These last 11 1 2 years of service as a Seventy have been truly rewarding ones As I leave that quorum I want my fellow Brethren to know of my love and appreciation for their dedication and loyalty to the kingdom of God on the earth for their faithfulness and good works I want them to know of the joy it has been to serve with them I love the Brethren we sustain as prophets seers and revelators with all my heart I ve tried to serve honorably and lighten their responsibilities in any way I could I m grateful to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve for their lives of goodness and example their patience their teaching their kindness their devotion to our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ and His restored gospel I am grateful that God called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to earth My experience as a General Authority has filled my heart with appreciation for the faith and goodness of the Latter day Saints all over the world We served for two years in the Philippines In April of 1961 President Hinckley then an Assistant to the Twelve sent the first missionaries to Manila There was only one Filipino priesthood holder in the Philippines Today there are almost 600 000 members Their lives are not easy and they lack many material things but they love the Savior The gospel is having a tremendous impact in improving their lives What a blessing to serve in their midst We also served for three years in the Pacific Islands It is significant that almost 25 percent of all the Polynesians in the world are members of the Church Their faith and spirituality are legendary Sister Cook and I were in Vava u in the Tongan islands on one occasion I had just spoken about following the prophet in the general session of stake conference At the luncheon following the conference I sat next to a distinguished elderly patriarch He indicated how grateful he was to hear what the prophet was teaching He gave me the following account Vava u which is a relatively small island usually has sufficient rain but periodically there are severe droughts The island has long inlets or bays almost like sounds which curl into the island below steep hills When drought conditions left the village without water there was only one way they could obtain fresh water and stay alive Over the centuries they had found that fresh water traveled down through rock formations inside the mountains and came up in a few spots in the sea The Tongan men would set off in their small boats with a wise elder standing at one end of the boat looking for just the right spot The strong young men in the boat stood ready with containers to dive deep into the seawater When they reached the appropriate spot the wise man would raise both arms to heaven That was the signal The strong young men would dive off the boat as deep as they could and fill the containers with fresh springwater This old patriarch likened this lifesaving tradition to the living waters of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the wise man to God s prophet here on earth He noted that the water was pure fresh and in their drought condition lifesaving But it was not easy to find It was not visible to the untrained eye This patriarch wanted to know everything the prophet was teaching We live in a precarious time The world is in desperate need of the fresh springwater which is the gospel of Jesus Christ We should listen intently to the prophet as we make choices My own informal records indicate that President Hinckley has continually emphasized faith in the Lord Jesus Christ That has been followed by his emphasis on strengthening families and having family religious observance in the home Over and over again he has told us that if we would live a principle we would gain a testimony of the truthfulness of that principle which would in turn increase our faith I know that many of you are concerned about raising your children during these difficult times and increasing their faith When my wife and I were starting our family in the San Francisco Bay Area we had that same concern At a critical point our stake members were advised by Elder Harold B Lee then a member of the Twelve that we could raise our families in righteousness if we would Follow the prophet Create the true spirit of the gospel in our hearts and homes Be a light to those among whom we live Focus on the ordinances and principles taught in the temple See D C 115 5 Harold B Lee Your Light to Be a Standard unto the Nations Ensign Aug 1973 3 4 As we followed this counsel our faith increased and our fears decreased I believe we can raise righteous children anywhere in the world if they are taught religious principles in the home One area where members can live by faith and not by fear is in our missionary effort Prior to my call to the Presidency of the Seventy on August 1 of this year I had served in the Missionary Department for six years the last three years as Executive Director under Elder M Russell Ballard who served as Chairman of the Missionary Executive Council Some mission presidents informed us that many wonderful members are in camouflage to their neighbors and co workers They do not let people know who they are and what they believe We need much more member involvement in sharing the message of the Restoration Romans 10 verse 14 puts this into perspective How then shall they call on him speaking of the Savior in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher Verse 15 contains the wonderful message referenced in Isaiah How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings see also Isaiah 52 7 It has been observed that the members are going to have to move their feet and let their voices be heard if they are to achieve this blessing Preach My Gospel A Guide to Missionary Service was first introduced in October 2004 President Hinckley commenced this effort when he called for missionaries to learn the doctrine and to teach the principles by the Spirit Every member of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve participated to a significant degree Elder Ballard and I felt that the windows of heaven were opened and the Lord s inspiration poured out to bring forth this great resource Over 1 5 million copies of Preach My Gospel have been acquired by the members of the Church It is a wonderful foundation and the missionaries are powerful spiritual teachers However if we are to accomplish what President Hinckley has requested the members living by faith and not by fear need to share the gospel with their friends and associates In our individual callings we need to have faith and not be fearful Our daughter Kathryn is serving as the Primary president in her ward in Salt Lake City My wife and I attended her ward last Sunday to observe the Primary sacrament meeting presentation I ll Follow Him in Faith I was thrilled to hear the children recite scriptures and stories coupled with songs focused on faith in Christ After the meeting I asked her about her calling She said that initially the calling weighed her down Much time was spent going over problems Then the presidency decided to emphasize love faith and prayer Suddenly spiritual impressions came to mind about a particular child or family Friction was replaced with love She tells me that as they acted upon promptings from the Spirit Primary reflected a reverence and peace and real gospel learning was taking place It is our faith in Jesus Christ that sustains us at the crossroads of life s journey It is the first principle of the gospel Without it we will spin our wheels at the intersection spending our precious time but getting nowhere It is Christ who offers the invitation to follow Him to give Him our burden and to carry His yoke for His yoke is easy and His burden is light Matthew 11 30 There is no other name under heaven whereby man can be saved see Acts 4 12 We must take upon us His name and receive His image in our countenance so that when He comes we will be more like Him see 1 John 3 2 Alma 5 14 When we choose to follow Christ in faith rather than choosing another path out of fear we are blessed with a consequence that is consistent with our choice see D C 6 34 36 May we all recognize and give thanks for the incomparable gift of life we each enjoy and for the breath that He lends us daily May we choose to have conviction at the crossroads of life and exercise faith in Jesus Christ My prayer is that we will live by faith and not by fear I bear my witness of God who is our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ who atoned for our sins in the name of Jesus Christ amen 
A number of years ago I was in Atlanta Georgia as an attorney representing a man who was buying a business After several days of negotiations we reached an agreement and signed the closing documents That evening one of the sellers invited us to a dinner to celebrate the closing When I arrived he offered me an alcoholic drink which I declined He then said Are you a Saint I didn t fully understand what he meant and he repeated Are you a Latter day Saint I responded Yes I am and he said he had been observing my personal habits during our negotiations and had concluded that I was either LDS or had a stomach problem We both chuckled He then informed me that he had only known one member of the Church on a personal basis David B Haight They were both executives in Chicago with a large retail chain following World War II He told me of the significant influence Elder Haight had been in his life and that he held him in the highest regard As I flew back home to San Francisco I thought about what had occurred especially in two respects I was surprised at how it felt to be asked if I was a Saint and I was impressed with the positive influence one outstanding example Elder Haight had on this good man What does it mean to be a Saint In the Lord s Church the members are Latter day Saints and they attempt to emulate the Savior follow His teachings and receive saving ordinances in order to live in the celestial kingdom with God the Father and our Savior Jesus Christ 1 The Savior said This is my gospel and ye know the things that ye must do in my church for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do 2It is not easy to be a Latter day Saint It was not meant to be easy The ultimate goal of living in the presence of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ is a privilege almost beyond comprehension Among the greatest trials the Church has ever faced were the Martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and then ultimately the expulsion of the Saints from Nauvoo When they were making their way across the plains under very adverse circumstances William Clayton penned the great hymn Come Come Ye Saints It was a hymn that stirred their souls and helped them remember their sacred mission Who among us does not become emotional as we feel their sacrifice courage and commitment when we sing And should we die before our journey s through Happy day All is well 3This hymn gave them comfort solace and hope in a time of great difficulty with almost insurmountable obstacles It buoyed them up and highlighted the fact that this mortal life is a journey between premortal life and eternal life to come the great plan of happiness Brother Clayton s inspiring hymn emphasizes sacrifices and what it really means to be a Saint Our pioneer members met the challenges of their day to be Saints The word saint in Greek denotes set apart separate and holy 4 If we are to be Saints in our day we need to separate ourselves from evil conduct and destructive pursuits that are prevalent in the world We are bombarded with visual images of violence and immorality Inappropriate music and pornography are increasingly tolerated The use of drugs and alcohol is rampant There is less emphasis on honesty and character Individual rights are demanded but duties responsibilities and obligations are neglected There has been a coarsening of dialogue and increased exposure to that which is base and vulgar The adversary has been relentless in his efforts to undermine the plan of happiness If we separate ourselves from this worldly conduct we will have the Spirit in our lives and experience the joy of being worthy Latter day Saints As Saints we also need to avoid the worship of worldly gods President Hinckley has expressed the desire that everyone might have some of the good things of life but has cautioned It is the obsession with riches that cankers and destroys 5In 1630 John Winthrop set forth a vision for the new land America on behalf of his fellow passengers as he sailed on board the Arbella It has become known as The City upon a Hill sermon In the final paragraph Winthrop references Deuteronomy 30 Deut 30 and warns against worshiping and serving other gods particularly emphasizing pleasures and profits 6 In the recent past President Kimball counseled that even homes boats credentials titles and other similar pursuits can be worshiped as idols when they entice us away from love and service to God 7The prophet Moroni speaking of our day warned about the love of money and substance and suggested that we would love them more than we love the poor and the needy the sick and the afflicted 8If we are to be worthy Saints we should minister to others and adhere to the Savior s admonition to love God and our fellowmen Separation from the evils of the world needs to be accompanied by holiness A Saint loves the Savior and follows Him in holiness and devotion 9 Evidence of this kind of holiness and devotion is exemplified by consecration and sacrifice President Hinckley has taught Without sacrifice there is no true worship of God 10 Sacrifice is the crowning test of the gospel It means consecrating time talents energy and earthly possessions to further the work of God In Doctrine and Covenants 97 verse 8 D C 97 8 it concludes All who are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice yea every sacrifice which I the Lord shall command they are accepted of me Saints who respond to the Savior s message will not be led astray by distracting and destructive pursuits and will be prepared to make appropriate sacrifices The importance of sacrifice to those who want to be Saints is exemplified by the atoning sacrifice of the Savior which is at the center of the gospel 11Coming back to the original question that my acquaintance in Atlanta asked Are you a Saint may I suggest three questions that will allow for a self assessment First is the way we live consistent with what we believe and would our friends and associates recognize as Elder Haight s friend did that we have separated ourselves from worldly evils Second are worldly pleasures profits and similar pursuits distracting us from following worshiping and serving the Savior in our daily lives Third in order to serve God and be holy are we making sacrifices consistent with our covenants What a wonderful blessing it is to be a Latter day Saint I love the words in the last lines of the hymn O Saints of Zion O Saints of Zion tread the pathsYour faithful fathers trod Lift up your hearts in gratitudeAnd serve the living God 12I testify that avoiding evil and destructive pursuits and sacrificing in order to serve will qualify us to experience the joy of being committed Latter day Saints and as the scriptures promise bring peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come 13 In the name of Jesus Christ amen 
My beloved brothers and sisters this is my first opportunity to address you since the call to this new assignment There is no way to express either the sense of responsibility or the feelings of inadequacy that I have experienced but I want you to know how grateful I am for the privilege of serving the Lord The chorus of one of my favorite hymns entreats Lift up your heart Lift up your voice Rejoice again I say rejoice Rejoice the Lord Is King Hymns no 66 The text of the hymn is taken from Paul s writings to the Philippians Rejoice in the Lord alway and again I say Rejoice Philip 4 4 The dictionary defines rejoice as to feel joy or great delight Merriam Webster s Collegiate Dictionary 10th ed s v rejoice The source of the kind of joy which causes us to rejoice is an understanding of the plan of salvation The Savior in the Gospel of John was approaching the closing hours of His mortal life when He would take upon Himself the sins of the world As He prepared His disciples for what He knew was to come He told them A little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me John 16 16 They were not yet ready to comprehend the Resurrection Instead the Savior explained in gentle terms that He would leave and return and told them what they would feel sorrow at His leaving but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you John 16 22 Just as the Savior s death brought sorrow the vicissitudes of life like death disease poverty and injury can and often will bring unhappiness Separation from those we love invariably brings sorrow and mourning Life is not easy and it would be improper to diminish in any way the trials and tribulations that most experience That having been said the Resurrection and Atonement wrought by the Savior and the promise of eternal life with our loved ones are of such overwhelming significance that to not rejoice would demonstrate a lack of understanding of the Savior s gift Joy comes when we have the Spirit in our lives see Alma 22 15 When we have the Spirit we rejoice in what the Savior has done for us What do we need to do to have this kind of joy In addition to attaining saving ordinances and following the living prophet we need to live in accordance with certain fundamental spiritual principles such as prayer scripture study righteous living and service to others It is well understood that if we engage in sinful conduct we must repent Let me suggest three other areas or distractions we need to avoid in order to maintain joy and rejoice more fully in the Savior s gift 1 avoid distractions which keep us from doing what we ought to do 2 avoid the magnification of small imperfections and 3 avoid unfavorable comparisons with others We are often unaware of the distractions which push us in a material direction and keep us from a Christ centered focus In essence we let celestial goals get sidetracked by telestial distractions In our family we call these telestial distractions Saturday Morning Cartoons Let me explain When our children were small my wife Mary and I decided to follow a tradition which my father taught when I was a child He would meet with us individually to help us set goals in various aspects of our lives and then teach us how Church school and extracurricular activities would help us achieve those goals He had three rules We needed to have worthwhile goals We could change our goals at any time Whatever goal we chose we had to diligently work towards it Having been the beneficiary of this tradition I had the desire to engage in this practice with my children When our son Larry was five years old I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up He said he wanted to be a doctor like his Uncle Joe Larry had experienced a serious operation and had acquired great respect for doctors especially his Uncle Joe I proceeded to tell Larry how all the worthwhile things he was doing would help prepare him to be a doctor Several months later I asked him again what he would like to be This time he said he wanted to be an airline pilot Changing the goal was fine so I proceeded to explain how his various activities would help him achieve this goal Almost as an afterthought I said Larry last time we talked you wanted to be a doctor What has changed your mind He answered I still like the idea of being a doctor but I have noticed that Uncle Joe works on Saturday mornings and I wouldn t want to miss Saturday Morning Cartoons Since that time our family has labeled a distraction from a worthwhile goal as a Saturday Morning Cartoon What are some of the Saturday Morning Cartoons that distract us from attaining the joy that we desire Some want to be married in the temple but only date those who do not qualify for a recommend Others want to be a good home teacher or visiting teacher but are distracted by the constant parade of TV programs catalogs and other material maintenance and don t find time to minister to those they are assigned to teach Still others want to have family prayer but allow little matters to build into discord that make it harder for the family to kneel together If we examine the reasons we don t do what we ought to do we find that the list of Saturday Morning Cartoons is almost endless Speaking of those who will not inherit a kingdom of glory the Lord said For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him and he receive not the gift Behold he rejoices not in that which is given unto him neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift D C 88 33 The greatest gift to all mankind is the Atonement of Jesus Christ If we are to rejoice in this gift we need to avoid the Saturday Morning Cartoons of life which distract our focus from the Savior and the celestial goal for which we strive A second group who do not find joy are distracted by magnifying small areas of imperfection so as to drive out happiness Some have allowed their own perceptions of imperfection to cloud the reality of their lives An objective outsider observing them would conclude that they should be joyful But they do not feel to rejoice They are like the couple who have been invited to visit a beautiful garden Instead of celebrating the visual feast they see only the few wilted flowers and weeds and the relatively small areas which are not beautiful to behold They do not feel the garden meets their expectations In like manner they are unduly critical of themselves and of others They have become accustomed to exaggerating small imperfections and underestimating great blessings and have lost the capacity to rejoice The Savior in Luke mildly cautioned Martha about this approach when she complained that her sister Mary was spending too much time listening to the Savior instead of serving temporal needs He said Martha Martha thou art troubled about many things Luke 10 41 The Savior then indicated that Mary was focused on what really mattered A third area of distraction that can destroy joy is comparing our talents and blessings with others The growth in our own talents is the best measure of personal progress In recent years the concept of personal best has become widely accepted This has great merit Remember we usually judge others at their best and ourselves at our worst In the parable of the talents the servants who received five talents and two talents were praised by the Lord for increasing their talents and told to enter thou into the joy of thy lord The servant who was rebuked was the servant who buried the talent given him See Matt 25 14 30 Comparing blessings is almost certain to drive out joy We cannot be grateful and envious at the same time If we truly want to have the Spirit of the Lord and experience joy and happiness we should rejoice in our blessings and be grateful We should especially rejoice in the blessings that are available through the temple On April 3 1836 the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were engaged in sacred spiritual worship in the Kirtland Temple After a solemn and silent prayer the Lord appeared to them and accepted the Kirtland Temple as His house The marvelous description of the Savior and the appearance of ancient prophets who restored essential keys make the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants one of the most sacred and profound of all the communications the Lord has given us Some of the most beautiful words in this section or that any of us could ever hope to hear are contained in verses 5 and 6 Behold your sins are forgiven you you are clean before me therefore lift up your heads and rejoice Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice and let the hearts of all my people rejoice who have with their might built this house to my name D C 110 5 6 Brothers and sisters let us avoid the Saturday Morning Cartoons of life particularly those that would keep us from the temple Let us rejoice in the promise that is ours through the Atonement of the Savior and through Christlike living adhere to the counsel of the Psalmist This is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it Ps 118 24 That each of us may do this is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ amen
