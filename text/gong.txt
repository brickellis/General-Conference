Dear brothers and sisters with hosanna and hallelujah we celebrate the living Jesus Christ at this season of continuing Restoration and Easter With perfect love our Savior assures us In me ye might have peace In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world 1Some years ago as Sister Gong and I met a lovely family their young daughter Ivy shyly brought out her violin case She lifted out the violin bow tightened and put rosin on it Then she put the bow back in the case curtsied and sat down A new beginner she had just shared all she knew about the violin Now years later Ivy plays the violin beautifully In this mortal period we are all a little like Ivy and her violin We begin at the beginning With practice and persistence we grow and improve With the passage of time moral agency and mortal experiences help us become more like our Savior as we labor with Him in His vineyard2 and follow His covenant path Anniversaries including this bicentennial highlight patterns of restoration 3 In celebrating the ongoing Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ we also prepare for Easter In both we rejoice in the return of Jesus Christ He lives not only then but now not just for some but for all He came and comes to heal the brokenhearted deliver the captives recover sight to the blind and set at liberty those who are bruised 4 That s each of us His redeeming promises apply no matter our past our present or concerns for our future Tomorrow is Palm Sunday Traditionally palms are a sacred symbol to express joy in our Lord as in Christ s Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem where much people took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him 5 You may be interested to know the original of this Harry Anderson painting hangs in President Russell M Nelson s office just behind his desk In the book of Revelation those who praise God and the Lamb do so clothed with white robes and palms in their hands 6 Along with robes of righteousness and crowns of glory palms are included in the Kirtland Temple dedicatory prayer 7Of course the significance of Palm Sunday goes beyond crowds greeting Jesus with palms On Palm Sunday Jesus entered Jerusalem in ways the faithful recognized as fulfillment of prophecy As Zechariah8 and the Psalmist prophetically foretold our Lord entered Jerusalem riding a colt as multitudes knowingly cried Hosanna in the highest 9 Hosanna means save now 10 Then as now we rejoice Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord 11A week following Palm Sunday is Easter Sunday President Russell M Nelson teaches that Jesus Christ came to pay a debt He didn t owe because we owed a debt we couldn t pay 12 Indeed through the Atonement of Christ all God s children may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel 13 At Easter we sing hallelujah Hallelujah means praise ye the Lord Jehovah 14 The Hallelujah Chorus in Handel s Messiah is a beloved Easter declaration that He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords 15The sacred events between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday are the story of hosanna and hallelujah Hosanna is our plea for God to save Hallelujah expresses our praise to the Lord for the hope of salvation and exaltation In hosanna and hallelujah we recognize the living Jesus Christ as the heart of Easter and latter day restoration Latter day restoration begins with theophany the literal appearance of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ to the young prophet Joseph Smith Said the Prophet Joseph Could you gaze into heaven five minutes you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was written on the subject 16 Because the heavens are again open we know and believe in God the Eternal Father and in His Son Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost 17 the divine Godhead On Easter Sunday April 3 1836 in the early days of the Restoration the living Jesus Christ appeared after the Kirtland Temple was dedicated Those who saw Him there testified of Him in complementary contrasts of fire and water His eyes were as a flame of fire the hair of his head was white like the pure snow his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters even the voice of Jehovah 18On that occasion our Savior declared I am the first and the last I am he who liveth I am he who was slain I am your advocate with the Father 19 Again complementary contrasts first and last living and slain He is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end 20 the author and finisher of our faith 21Following the appearance of Jesus Christ Moses Elias and Elijah also came By divine direction these great prophets of old restored priesthood keys and authority Thus the keys of this dispensation are committed 22 within His restored Church to bless all God s children The coming of Elijah in the Kirtland Temple also fulfilled Malachi s Old Testament prophecy that Elijah would return before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord 23 In doing so Elijah s appearance coincided though not by coincidence with the Jewish Passover season which tradition reverently anticipates Elijah s return Many devout Jewish families set a place for Elijah at their Passover table Many fill a cup to the brim to invite and welcome him And some during the traditional Passover Seder send a child to the door sometimes left partly open to see if Elijah is outside waiting to be invited in 24In fulfillment of prophecy and as part of the promised restoration of all things 25 Elijah did come as promised at Easter and the onset of Passover He brought the sealing authority to bind families on earth and in heaven As Moroni taught the Prophet Joseph Elijah shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers If it were not so Moroni continued the whole earth would be utterly wasted at the Lord s coming 26 The spirit of Elijah a manifestation of the Holy Ghost draws us to our generations past present and future in our genealogies histories and temple service Let us also briefly recall what Passover signifies Passover remembers the deliverance of the children of Israel from 400 years of bondage The book of Exodus relates how this deliverance came after plagues of frogs lice flies the death of cattle boils blains hail and fire locusts and thick darkness The final plague threatened the death of the firstborn in the land but not in the house of Israel if if those households put the blood of an unblemished firstling lamb on the lintels of their doors 27The angel of death passed by the houses marked with the symbolic blood of the lamb 28 That passing by or pass over represents Jesus Christ ultimately overcoming death Indeed the atoning blood of the Lamb of God gives our Good Shepherd power to gather His people in all places and circumstances into the safety of His fold on both sides of the veil Significantly the Book of Mormon describes the power and resurrection of Christ 29 the essence of Easter in terms of two restorations First resurrection includes physical restoration of our proper and perfect frame every limb and joint even a hair of the head shall not be lost 30 This promise gives hope to those who have lost limbs those who have lost ability to see hear or walk or those thought lost to relentless disease mental illness or other diminished capacity He finds us He makes us whole A second promise of Easter and our Lord s Atonement is that spiritually all things shall be restored to their proper order 31 This spiritual restoration reflects our works and desires Like bread upon the water 32 it restores that which is good righteous just and merciful 33 No wonder the prophet Alma uses the word restore 22 times34 as he urges us to deal justly judge righteously and do good continually 35Because God himself atoneth for the sins of the world 36 the Lord s Atonement can make whole not only what was but also what can be Because He knows ours pains afflictions sicknesses our temptations of every kind 37 He can with mercy succor us according to our infirmities 38 Because God is a perfect just God and a merciful God also the plan of mercy can appease the demands of justice 39 We repent and do all we can He encircles us eternally in the arms of his love 40Today we celebrate restoration and resurrection With you I rejoice in the ongoing Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ As began 200 years ago this spring light and revelation continue to come forth through the Lord s living prophet and His Church called in His name The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and through personal revelation and inspiration by the supernal gift of the Holy Ghost With you at this Easter season I testify of God our Eternal Father and His Beloved Son the living Jesus Christ Mortal men were cruelly crucified and later resurrected But only the living Jesus Christ in His perfect resurrected form still bears the marks of crucifixion in His hands feet and side Only He can say I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands 41 Only He can say I am he who was lifted up I am Jesus that was crucified I am the Son of God 42Like little Ivy and her violin we are in some ways still beginning Truly eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him 43 In these times we can learn much of God s goodness and our divine potential for God s love to grow in us as we seek Him and reach out to each other In new ways and new places we can do and become line upon line kindness upon kindness individually and together Dear brothers and sisters everywhere as we meet and learn together your faith and goodness fill me with a sense of gospel adventure and gratitude Your testimony and gospel journey enrich my testimony and gospel journey Your concerns and joys your love for the household of God and community of Saints and your lived understanding of restored truth and light increase my fulness of the restored gospel with the living Jesus Christ at its heart Together we trust thru cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me 44 Unitedly we know amidst our loads and cares we can count our many blessings 45 In the daily details and small and simple things we can see great things brought to pass in our lives 46 And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from among all nations and shall come to Zion singing with songs of everlasting joy 47 At this season of hosanna and hallelujah sing hallelujah for He shall reign forever and ever Shout hosanna to God and the Lamb In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters the story is told of a Primary child learning to pray Thank you for the letter A the letter B the letter G The child s prayer continues Thank you for the letters X Y Z Dear Heavenly Father thank you for the number 1 the number 2 The Primary teacher worries but wisely waits The child says Thank you for the number 5 the number 6 and thank you for my Primary teacher She s the only person who s ever let me finish my prayer Heavenly Father does hear every child s prayer With infinite love He beckons us to come believe and belong by covenant This world is full of mirage illusion sleight of hand So much seems transitory and superficial When we put aside the masks pretense crowd sourced likes and dislikes we yearn for more than fleeting veneer ephemeral connection or the pursuit of worldly self interest Gratefully there is a way through to answers that matter When we come to God s great commandments to love Him and those around us by covenant we do so not as stranger or guest but as His child at home 1 The age old paradox is still true In losing our worldly self through covenant belonging we find and become our best eternal self2 free alive real and define our most important relationships Covenant belonging is to make and keep solemn promises to God and each other through sacred ordinances that invite the power of godliness to be manifest in our lives 3 When we covenant all we are we can become more than we are Covenant belonging gives us place narrative capacity to become It produces faith unto life and salvation 4Divine covenants become a source of love for and from God and thereby for and with each other God our Heavenly Father loves us more and knows us better than we love or know ourselves Faith in Jesus Christ and personal change repentance bring mercy grace forgiveness These comfort the hurt loneliness injustice we experience in mortality Being God our Heavenly Father wants us to receive God s greatest gift His joy His eternal life 5Our God is a God of covenant By His nature He keepest covenant and showest mercy 6 His covenants endure so long as time shall last or the earth shall stand or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved 7 We are not meant to wander in existential uncertainty and doubt but to rejoice in cherished covenant relationships stronger than the cords of death 8God s ordinances and covenants are universal in their requirement and individual in their opportunity In God s fairness each individual in every place and age can receive saving ordinances Agency applies individuals choose whether to accept offered ordinances God s ordinances provide guideposts on His path of covenants We call God s plan to bring His children home the plan of redemption plan of salvation plan of happiness Redemption salvation celestial happiness are possible because Jesus Christ wrought out this perfect atonement 9To belong with God and to walk with each other on His covenant path is to be blessed by covenant belonging First covenant belonging centers in Jesus Christ as mediator of the new covenant 10 All things can work together for our good when we are sanctified in Christ in the covenant of the Father 11 Every good and promised blessing comes to those who remain faithful to the end The happy state of those that keep the commandments of God is to be blessed in all things both temporal and spiritual and to dwell with God in never ending happiness 12As we honor our covenants we may sometimes feel we are in the company of angels And we will be those we love and who bless us on this side of the veil and those who love and bless us from the other side of the veil Recently Sister Gong and I saw covenant belonging at its tender best in a hospital room A young father desperately needed a kidney transplant His family had wept fasted and prayed for him to receive a kidney When news came that a life saving kidney had just become available his wife quietly said I hope the other family is OK To belong by covenant is in the words of the Apostle Paul that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me 13Along life s path we may lose faith in God but He never loses faith in us As it were His porch light is always on He invites us to come or return to the covenants that mark His path He waits ready to embrace us even when we are yet a great way off 14 When we look with an eye of faith for the patterns arc or connected dots of our experience we can see His tender mercies and encouragement especially in our trials sorrows and challenges as well as in our joys However often we stumble or fall if we keep moving toward Him He will help us a step at a time Second the Book of Mormon is evidence we can hold in our hand of covenant belonging The Book of Mormon is the promised instrument for the gathering of God s children prophesied as a new covenant 15 As we read the Book of Mormon by ourselves and with others whether silently or aloud we can ask God with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ and receive by the power of the Holy Ghost God s assurance that the Book of Mormon is true 16 This includes assurance that Jesus Christ is our Savior Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration and the Lord s Church is called by His name The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 17The Book of Mormon speaks by ancient and modern covenant to you who are the children of Lehi children of the prophets 18 Your forefathers received a covenant promise that you their descendants would recognize a voice as if from the dust in the Book of Mormon 19 That voice you feel as you read testifies you are children of the covenant 20 and Jesus is your Good Shepherd The Book of Mormon invites each of us in Alma s words to enter into a covenant with the Lord that we will serve him and keep his commandments that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon us 21 When we want to change for the better as one person put it to stop being miserable and to be happy being happy we can become open to direction help and strength We can come by covenant to belong with God and a community of faithful believers and receive the blessings promised in the doctrine of Christ22 now Restored priesthood authority and power to bless all His children is a third dimension of covenant belonging In this dispensation John the Baptist and the Apostles Peter James and John have come as glorified messengers from God to restore His priesthood authority 23 God s priesthood and His ordinances sweeten relationships on earth and can seal covenant relationships in heaven 24Priesthood can bless literally from cradle to grave from an infant s name and blessing to a grave dedication Priesthood blessings heal comfort counsel A father was angry with his son until forgiving love came as the father gave his son a tender priesthood blessing The only member of the Church in her family a dear young woman was uncertain about God s love for her until she received an inspired priesthood blessing Across the world noble patriarchs prepare spiritually to give patriarchal blessings As the patriarch lays his hands on your head he feels and expresses God s love for you He pronounces your lineage in the house of Israel He indicates blessings from the Lord Typically thoughtful one patriarch s wife told me how she and her family invite the Spirit especially on days their papa is giving patriarchal blessings Finally the blessings of covenant belonging come when we follow the Lord s prophet and rejoice in temple covenant living including in marriage Covenant marriage becomes supernal and eternal as we daily choose the happiness of our spouse and family before our own As me becomes we we grow together We grow old together we grow young together As we bless each other across a lifetime of forgetting ourselves we find our hopes and joys sanctified in time and eternity While situations differ when we do all we can the best we can and sincerely ask and seek His help along the way the Lord will guide us in His time and manner by the Holy Ghost 25 Marriage covenants are binding by mutual choice of those making them a reminder of God s and our respect for agency and the blessing of His help when we unitedly seek it The fruits of covenant belonging across family generations are felt in our homes and hearts Please allow me to illustrate with personal examples When Sister Gong and I were falling in love toward marriage I learned about agency and decisions For a period of time we were in school studying in two different countries on two different continents It is why I can honestly say I earned a PhD in international relations When I asked Heavenly Father should I marry Susan I felt peace But it was when I learned to pray with real intent Heavenly Father I love Susan and want to marry her I promise I will be the best husband and father I can be when I acted and made my best decisions it was then the strongest spiritual confirmations came Now our Gong and Lindsay FamilySearch family trees stories and photos help us discover and connect through the lived experience of generational covenant belonging 26 For us respected progenitors include Great Grandma Alice Blauer Bangerter who had three marriage proposals in one day later asked her husband to rig a foot pedal to her butter churn so she could churn butter knit and read at the same time Great Grandpa Loy Kuei Char carried his children on his back and his family s few belongings on a donkey as they crossed the lava fields on Hawaii s Big Island Generations of Char family commitment and sacrifice bless our family today Gram Mary Alice Powell Lindsay was left with five young children when her husband and oldest son both died suddenly just days apart A widow for 47 years Gram raised her family with sustaining love from local leaders and members During those many years Gram promised the Lord if He would help her she would never complain The Lord helped her She never complained Dear brothers and sisters as witnessed by the Holy Ghost everything good and eternal is centered in the living reality of God our Eternal Father and His Son Jesus Christ and His Atonement Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant Testifying of Jesus Christ is a covenant purpose of the Book of Mormon 27 By oath and covenant God s restored priesthood authority is intended to bless all God s children including through covenant marriage generational family and individual blessings Our Savior declares I am Alpha and Omega Christ the Lord yea even I am he the beginning and the end the Redeemer of the world 28With us at the beginning He is with us in all our covenant belonging to the end I so testify in the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters have you ever had trouble falling asleep and tried counting imaginary sheep As fluffy sheep jump over a fence you count 1 2 3 245 246 657 658 1In my case counting sheep doesn t make me sleepy I worry about missing or losing one and that keeps me awake With the shepherd boy who became a king we declare The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want He maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters He restoreth my soul 2At this Easter season we celebrate the Good Shepherd who is also the Lamb of God Of all His divine titles no others are more tender or telling We learn much from our Savior s references to Himself as the Good Shepherd and from prophetic testimonies of Him as the Lamb of God These roles and symbols are powerfully complementary who better to succor each precious lamb than the Good Shepherd and who better to be our Good Shepherd than the Lamb of God For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son and God s Only Begotten Son laid down His life in willing obedience to His Father 3 Jesus testifies I am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep 4 Jesus had power to lay down His life and power to take it up again 5 United with His Father our Savior uniquely blesses us both as our Good Shepherd and as the Lamb of God As our Good Shepherd Jesus Christ calls us in His voice and His name He seeks and gathers us He teaches us how to minister in love Let us consider these three themes beginning with Him calling us in His voice and His name First our Good Shepherd calleth his own sheep by name They know his voice 6 And in his own name he doth call you which is the name of Christ 7 As we seek with real intent to follow Jesus Christ inspiration comes to do good to love God and to serve Him 8 As we study ponder and pray as we regularly renew sacramental and temple covenants and as we invite all to come to His gospel and ordinances we are hearkening to His voice In our day President Russell M Nelson counsels us to call the restored Church by the name Jesus Christ revealed The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints 9 The Lord said Whatsoever ye shall do ye shall do it in my name therefore ye shall call the church in my name and ye shall call upon the Father in my name that he will bless the church for my sake 10 Across the world in our hearts and homes we call upon the Father in the name of Jesus Christ We are grateful for such generous blessing of our home centered Church supported worship gospel study and wholesome family activities Second our Good Shepherd seeks and gathers us into His one fold He asks What man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it 11Our Savior reaches out to the one and to the ninety and nine often at the same time As we minister we acknowledge the ninety and nine who are steadfast and immovable even while we yearn after the one who has strayed Our Lord seeks and delivers us out of all places 12 from the four quarters of the earth 13 He gathers us by holy covenant and His atoning blood 14Our Savior told His New Testament disciples Other sheep I have which are not of this fold 15 In the Americas the resurrected Lord testified to Lehi s covenant children Ye are my sheep 16 And Jesus said yet other sheep would hear His voice 17 What a blessing the Book of Mormon is as another testament witnessing the voice of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ invites the Church to receive all who hear His voice18 and keep His commandments The doctrine of Christ includes baptism by water and by fire and the Holy Ghost 19 Nephi asks If the Lamb of God he being holy should have need to be baptized by water to fulfil all righteousness O then how much more need have we being unholy to be baptized yea even by water 20Today our Savior desires that what we do and who we are becoming will invite others to come follow Him Come find love healing connection and covenant belonging in Him including in God s holy temple where sacred ordinances of salvation can bless all family members thus gathering Israel on both sides of the veil 21Third as the Shepherd of Israel 22 Jesus Christ exemplifies how shepherds in Israel minister in love When our Lord asks if we love Him as He did with Simon Peter our Savior implores Feed my lambs Feed my sheep Feed my sheep 23 The Lord promises that when His shepherds feed His lambs and sheep those in His fold shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking 24Our Good Shepherd cautions that shepherds in Israel must not slumber 25 nor scatter or cause the sheep to go astray 26 nor look our own way for our own gain 27 God s shepherds are to strengthen heal bind up that which is broken bring again that which was driven away seek that which was lost 28The Lord also warns of hirelings who careth not for the sheep 29 and false prophets who come to you in sheep s clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves 30Our Good Shepherd rejoices when we exercise individual moral agency with intention and faith Those in His fold look to our Savior in gratitude for His atoning sacrifice We covenant to follow Him not passively blindly or sheepishly but instead desiring with all our hearts and minds to love God and our neighbor bearing one another s burdens and rejoicing in one another s joys As Christ freely dedicated His will to the will of the Father so we reverently take upon us His name We gladly seek to join His work of gathering and ministering to all of God s children Brothers and sisters Jesus Christ is our perfect Good Shepherd Because He has laid down His life for us and is now gloriously resurrected Jesus Christ is also the perfect Lamb of God 31The sacrificial Lamb of God was foreshadowed from the beginning The angel told Adam his sacrifice is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father which invites us to repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore 32Father Abraham who established covenant blessings for all the nations of the earth experienced what it meant to offer his begotten son And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said My father and he said Here am I my son And he said Behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb And Abraham said My son God will provide himself a lamb 33Apostles and prophets foresaw and rejoiced in the foreordained mission of the Lamb of God John in the Old World and Nephi in the New World testified of the Lamb of God 34 yea even the Son of the Eternal Father the Redeemer of the world 35Abinadi testified of Jesus Christ s atoning sacrifice All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all 36 Alma called the great and last sacrifice of the Son of God the one thing which is of more importance than they all Alma encouraged Have faith on the Lamb of God come and fear not 37A dear friend shared how she gained her precious testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ She grew up believing sin always brought great punishment borne by us alone She pleaded to God to understand the possibility of divine forgiveness She prayed to understand and know how Jesus Christ can forgive those who repent how mercy can satisfy justice One day her prayer was answered in a spiritually transforming experience A desperate young man came running out of a grocery store carrying two bags of stolen food He ran into a busy street chased by the store manager who caught him and began yelling and fighting Instead of feeling judgment for the frightened young man as a thief my friend was unexpectedly filled with great compassion for him Without fear or concern for her own safety she walked straight up to the two quarreling men She found herself saying I will pay for the food Please let him go Please let me pay for the food Prompted by the Holy Ghost and filled with a love she had never felt before my friend said All I wanted to do was to help and save the young man My friend said she began to understand Jesus Christ and His Atonement how and why with pure and perfect love Jesus Christ would willingly sacrifice to be her Savior and Redeemer and why she wanted Him to be 38No wonder we sing See the Good Shepherd is seeking Seeking the lambs that are lost Bringing them in with rejoicing Saved at such infinite cost 39As Lamb of God our Savior knows when we feel alone diminished uncertain or afraid In vision Nephi saw the power of the Lamb of God descend upon the saints of the church of the Lamb and upon the covenant people of the Lord Though scattered upon all the face of the earth they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory 40This promise of hope and comfort includes our day Are you the only member of the Church in your family school workplace or community Does your branch sometimes feel small or isolated Have you moved to a new place perhaps with an unfamiliar language or customs Perhaps your life s circumstances have changed and things you never thought possible now confront you Our Savior assures us whatever our circumstances whoever we are in the words of Isaiah He shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young 41Brothers and sisters our Good Shepherd calls us in His voice and in His name He seeks gathers and comes to His people Through His living prophet and each of us He invites all to find peace purpose healing and joy in the fulness of His restored gospel and on His covenant path By example He teaches the shepherds of Israel to minister in His love As Lamb of God Jesus s divine mission was foreordained and rejoiced in by apostles and prophets His Atonement infinite and eternal is central to the plan of happiness and the purpose of creation He assures us that He carries us next to His heart Dear brothers and sisters may we desire to be humble followers of God and the Lamb 42 perhaps someday to have our names written in the Lamb s book of life 43 to sing the song of the Lamb 44 to be invited to the supper of the Lamb 45As Shepherd and Lamb He calls Come again to the true knowledge of your Redeemer your great and true shepherd 46 He promises that by his grace we may become perfect in Christ 47At this Easter season we praise Him Worthy is the Lamb 48 Hosanna to God and the Lamb 49I testify of Him our perfect Good Shepherd the perfect Lamb of God He calls us by our name in His name even the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters isn t it marvelous to receive continuing revelation from heaven through President Russell M Nelson and our Church leaders that invites us to live in new and holier ways 1 at home and at church with all our heart mind and strength Have you ever had opportunity to do something for which you felt unprepared or inadequate but that you were blessed for trying I have Here s one example Some years ago Elder Richard G Scott a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles kindly invited Gerrit would you like to watercolor with me Elder Scott said painting helped him observe and create He has written Attempt to be creative even if the results are modest Creativity can engender a spirit of gratitude for life and for what the Lord has woven into your being If you choose wisely it doesn t have to absorb a lot of time 2President Henry B Eyring describes his artistic meditations as motivated by a feeling of love including the love of a Creator who expects His children to become like Him to create and to build 3 President Eyring s creative works provide a unique spiritual perspective on testimony and faith 4President Boyd K Packer s artwork illustrates a fundamental gospel message God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and all things that are in them that all nature bears testimony of that divinely directed creation and that there is a complete harmony between nature science and the gospel of Jesus Christ 5Alma testifies All things denote there is a God 6 Our Primary children sing Whenever I hear the song of a bird or look at the blue blue sky I m glad that I live in this beautiful world Heav nly Father created for me 7 Author Victor Hugo celebrates the miraculous relationships between beings and things in this inexhaustible whole from sun to aphid All the birds that fly hold the thread of eternity in their claws A nebula is an anthill of stars 8And that brings us back to Elder Scott s invitation Elder Scott I replied I would like to become more observant and creative I thrill to imagine Heavenly Father paints with billowing clouds and every hue of sky and water But here was a long pause Elder Scott I said I have no skill to watercolor I worry it may frustrate you to try and teach me Elder Scott smiled and arranged for us to meet On the appointed day he prepared the paper paints and brushes He sketched some outlines and helped wet the paper for me We used as a model his beautiful watercolor titled Campfire at Sunset As we painted we talked about faith how as we face the light and warmth of a campfire we leave the darkness and uncertainty behind us how on sometimes long lonely nights our campfire of faith can give hope and assurance And the dawn does come Our campfire of faith our memories experiences and heritage of faith in God s goodness and tender mercies in our life has strengthened us through the night My testimony is for those who seek allow and live for it the dawn of faith sometimes gradually will come or can return The light will come when we desire and seek it when we are patient and obedient to God s commandments when we are open to God s grace healing and covenants As we began painting Elder Scott encouraged Gerrit even with one lesson you will paint something you will want to keep and remember Elder Scott was right I treasure the watercolor of our campfire of faith Elder Scott helped me paint My artistic ability was and remains limited but the remembrance of our campfire of faith can encourage us in five ways First our campfire of faith can encourage us to find joy in wholesome creativity There is joy in imagining learning doing worthwhile new things This is especially true as we deepen faith and trust in Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ We cannot love ourselves enough to save ourselves But Heavenly Father loves us more and knows us better than we love or know ourselves We can trust the Lord and lean not unto our own understanding 9Have you ever been the only one not invited to someone s birthday party Have you ever been chosen last or not chosen when teams were selected Have you prepared for a school test a job interview an opportunity you really wanted and you felt you failed Have you prayed for a relationship that for whatever reason has not worked out Have you faced chronic illness been abandoned by a spouse agonized for family Our Savior knows our circumstances As we exercise God given agency and engage all our faculties in humility and faith our Savior Jesus Christ can help us meet life s challenges and joys Faith includes a desire and choice to believe Faith also comes from obeying God s commandments given to bless us as we follow His covenant path When we have felt or feel uncertain alone frustrated angry let down disappointed or estranged from God and His restored Church it may take an extra measure of effort and faith to enter again on His covenant path But it is worth it Please come or come again unto the Lord Jesus Christ God s love is stronger than the cords of death temporal or spiritual 10 Our Savior s Atonement is infinite and eternal Each of us strays and falls short We may for a time lose our way God lovingly assures us no matter where we are or what we have done there is no point of no return He waits ready to embrace us 11Second our campfire of faith can encourage us to minister in new higher and holier Spirit filled ways Such ministering brings miracles and the blessings of covenant belonging where we feel God s love and seek to minister to others in that spirit Not long ago Sister Gong and I became acquainted with a father and family blessed by a faithful priesthood brother who came to their bishop and asked if he the priesthood brother could be a home teaching companion with the father The father was not active and not interested in home teaching But as the father s heart changed he and this loving priesthood brother began visiting their families After one such visit his wife herself not then attending church asked her husband how things had gone The father admitted I may have felt something then he went to the kitchen to get a beer 12But one thing followed another tender experiences ministering service changing hearts temple preparation class coming to church being sealed as a family in the holy temple Imagine how grateful the children and grandchildren are to their father and mother and to the ministering brother who came as a friend and companion with their father to minister to and love others A third campfire of faith encouragement creative gospel joy and blessings come when we seek to love the Lord and others with all our hearts and souls The scriptures invite us to place all we are and are becoming on the altar of love and service In the Old Testament Deuteronomy enjoins us to love the Lord thy God with all our heart soul and might 13 Joshua exhorts Love the Lord your God walk in all his ways keep his commandments cleave unto him and serve him with all your heart and with all your soul 14In the New Testament our Savior states the two great commandments Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and thy neighbour as thyself 15In the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ King Benjamin labored with all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul and established peace in the land 16 In the Doctrine and Covenants as every missionary knows the Lord asks us to serve Him with all our heart might mind and strength 17 When the Saints entered Jackson County the Lord commanded them to keep the Sabbath holy by loving the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy might mind and strength and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him 18We rejoice in the invitation to devote our whole souls to seeking higher and holier ways to love God and those around us and to strengthen our faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in our hearts and in our homes and at church Fourth our campfire of faith encourages us to establish regular patterns of righteous living that deepen faith and spirituality These holy habits righteous routines or prayerful patterns may include prayer scripture study fasting remembering our Savior and covenants through the ordinance of the sacrament sharing gospel blessings through missionary temple and family history and other service keeping a thoughtful personal journal and so on When righteous patterns and spiritual yearnings join time and eternity come together Spiritual light and life come when regular religious observance draws us closer to our Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus Christ When we love the spirit and letter of the law the things of eternity can distill upon our souls like the dews from heaven 19 With daily obedience and refreshing living water we find answers faith and strength to meet everyday challenges and opportunities with gospel patience perspective and joy Fifth as we keep the best of familiar patterns while seeking new and holier ways to love God and help us and others prepare to meet Him our campfire of faith can encourage us to remember perfection is in Christ not in ourselves or in the perfectionism of the world God s invitations are full of love and possibility because Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life 20 To those who feel burdened He invites Come unto me and to those who come to Him He promises I will give you rest 21 Come unto Christ and be perfected in him love God with all your might mind and strength then is his grace sufficient for you that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ 22In this assurance by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ is also the comfort peace and promise that we can continue forward with faith and confidence in the Lord even when things do not go as we hope expect or perhaps deserve through no fault of our own even after we have done our best In various times and ways we all feel inadequate uncertain perhaps unworthy Yet in our faithful efforts to love God and to minister to our neighbor we may feel God s love and needed inspiration for their and our lives in new and holier ways With compassion our Savior encourages and promises we can press forward with a steadfastness in Christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men 23 The doctrine of Christ our Savior s Atonement and our whole souled following of His covenant path can help us know His truths and make us free 24I testify the fulness of His gospel and His plan of happiness are restored and taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in holy scripture and by prophets from the Prophet Joseph Smith to President Russell M Nelson today I testify His covenant path leads to the greatest gift our loving Heavenly Father promises Ye shall have eternal life 25May His blessings and enduring joy be ours as we warm our hearts and hopes and commitment at our campfire of faith I pray in the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters when our sons were very young I told them bedtime stories about beagle puppies and hummed bedtime hymns including Christ the Lord Is Risen Today 1 Sometimes I playfully changed the words Now it s time to go to sleep hallelujah Usually our sons fell asleep quickly or at least they knew if I thought they were asleep I would stop singing Words at least my words cannot express the overwhelming feelings since President Russell M Nelson lovingly took my hands in his my dear Susan at my side and extended this sacred call from the Lord that took my breath away and has left me weeping many times these past days This Easter Sabbath I joyfully sing Alleluia The song of our risen Savior s redeeming love2 celebrates the harmony of covenants that connect us to God and to each other and the Atonement of Jesus Christ that helps us put off the natural man and woman and yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit3 Together our covenants and our Savior s Atonement enable and ennoble Together they help us hold on and let go Together they sweeten preserve sanctify redeem Said the Prophet Joseph Smith It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven Nevertheless in all ages of the world whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood to any man by actual revelation or any set of men this power has always been given 4And so it is today Sacred covenants and ordinances not available anywhere else are received in 159 holy houses of the Lord in 43 countries Promised blessings come through restored priesthood keys doctrine and authority reflecting our faith obedience and the promises of His Holy Spirit to us in our generations in time and eternity Dear brothers and sisters in every nation kindred and tongue across our worldwide Church thank you for your living faith hope and charity in every footstep Thank you for becoming a gathering fulness of restored gospel testimony and experience Dear brothers and sisters we belong to each other We can be knit together in unity and in love 5 in all things and in all places 6 As the Lord Jesus Christ invites each of us wherever we are whatever our circumstances please come and see 7This day I humbly pledge all the energies and faculties of my soul 8 whatever they be or may become to my Savior to my dear Susan and our family to my Brethren and to each of you my beloved brothers and sisters Everything worthy and eternal is centered in the living reality of God our loving Eternal Father and His Son Jesus Christ and His Atonement witnessed by the Holy Ghost 9 This is Easter Sunday I reverently witness and solemnly testify of the living Christ He who died was buried and rose again the third day and ascended into heaven 10 He is Alpha and Omega11 with us in the beginning He is with us to the end I testify of latter day prophets from the Prophet Joseph Smith to our dear President Russell M Nelson whom we joyfully sustain As our Primary children sing Follow the prophet he knows the way 12 I witness that as prophesied in the holy scriptures including in the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ the Lord s kingdom is once again established on the earth preparatory to the Second Coming of the Messiah 13 In the holy and sacred name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters when I served in Asia people sometimes asked Elder Gong how many people live in the Asia Area of the Church I said Half the world s population 3 6 billion people Someone asked Is it hard to remember all their names Remembering and forgetting are part of everyday life For example once after looking everywhere for her new mobile phone my wife finally decided to call it from another phone When she heard her phone ring my wife thought Who could be calling me I haven t given that number to anyone Remembering and forgetting are also part of our eternal journey Time agency and memory help us learn grow and increase in faith In the words of a favorite hymn We ll sing all hail to Jesus name And praise and honor give Ye Saints partake and testifyYe do remember him 1Each week in partaking of the sacrament we covenant to always remember Him Drawing on the nearly 400 scripture references to the word remember here are six ways we can always remember Him First we can always remember Him by having confidence in His covenants promises and assurances The Lord remembers His everlasting covenants from Adam s time to the day Adam s posterity shall embrace the truth and look upward then shall Zion look downward and all the heavens shall shake with gladness and the earth shall tremble with joy 2The Lord remembers His promises including promises to gather scattered Israel through the Book of Mormon Another Testament of Jesus Christ and promises given to every member and missionary who remembers the worth of souls 3The Lord remembers and assures nations and peoples In these days of motion and commotion 4 some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God 5 who guides the future as he has the past 6 In perilous times 7 we remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated but the work of men 8Second we can always remember Him by gratefully acknowledging His hand throughout our lives The Lord s hand in our lives is often clearest in hindsight As Christian philosopher S ren Kierkegaard put it Life must be understood backward But it must be lived forward 9My dear mother recently celebrated her 90th birthday She gratefully testified of God s blessing at each major juncture in her life Family histories family traditions and family ties help us savor remembrance of things past while providing future patterns and hope Priesthood lines of authority and patriarchal blessings witness of God s hand across generations Have you ever thought of yourself as your own living book of remembrance reflecting what and how you choose to remember For example when I was younger I really wanted to play school basketball I practiced and practiced One day the coach pointed to our 6 foot 4 inch 1 93 m all state center and our 6 foot 2 inch 1 88 m all star forward and said to me I can put you on the team but you ll likely never play I remember how kindly he then encouraged Why not try out for soccer You d be good My family cheered when I scored my first goal We can remember those who give us a chance and a second chance with honesty kindness patience and encouragement And we can become someone others remember when they most needed help Gratefully remembering the assistance of others and the Spirit s guiding influence is a way we remember Him It is a way we count our many blessings and see what God hath done 10Third we can always remember Him by trusting when the Lord assures us He who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and I the Lord remember them no more 11When we fully repent including by confessing and forsaking our sins we ask with Enos as our guilt is swept away Lord how is it done and hear the answer Because of thy faith in Christ 12 and His invitation to put me in remembrance 13Once we repent and priesthood leaders declare us worthy we need not continue to confess and confess these past sins To be worthy does not mean to be perfect Heavenly Father s plan of happiness invites us to be humbly at peace on our life s journey to someday become perfected in Christ 14 not constantly worried frustrated or unhappy in our imperfections today Remember He knows all the things we don t want anyone else to know about us and loves us still Sometimes life tests our trust in Christ s mercy justice and judgment and in His liberating invitation to allow His Atonement to heal us as we forgive others and ourselves A young woman in another country applied to work as a journalist but the official who assigned jobs was merciless He said to her With my signature I guarantee you will not become a journalist but will dig sewers She was the only woman digging sewers in a gang of men Years later this woman became an official One day a man came in needing her signature for a job She asked Do you remember me He did not She said You do not remember me but I remember you With your signature you guaranteed I never became a journalist With your signature you sent me to dig sewers the only woman in a gang of men She told me I feel I should treat that man better than he treated me but I do not have that strength Sometimes that strength is not within us but it can be found in remembering the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ When trust is betrayed dreams shattered hearts broken and broken again when we want justice and need mercy when our fists clench and our tears flow when we need to know what to hold onto and what to let go of we can always remember Him Life is not as cruel as it can sometimes seem His infinite compassion can help us find our way truth and life 15When we remember His words and example we will not give or take offense My friend s father worked as a mechanic His honest labor showed even in his carefully washed hands One day someone at a temple told my friend s father he should clean his hands before serving there Instead of being offended this good man began to scrub the family dishes by hand with extra soapy water before attending the temple He exemplifies those who ascend into the hill of the Lord and stand in his holy place with the cleanest of hands and the purest of hearts 16If we have unkind feelings grudges or resentments or if we have cause to ask forgiveness of others now is the time to do so Fourth He invites us to remember that He is always welcoming us home We learn by asking and searching But please do not cease exploration until you arrive in the words of T S Eliot where you started and know the place for the first time 17 When you are ready please open your heart to the Book of Mormon again for the first time Please pray with real intent again for the first time Trust that early or faint memory Let it enlarge your faith With God there is no point of no return Prophets ancient and modern implore us not to let human foibles faults or weaknesses others or our own cause us to miss the truths covenants and redeeming power in His restored gospel 18 This is especially important in a church where we each grow through our imperfect participation The Prophet Joseph said I never told you I was perfect but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught 19Fifth we can always remember Him on the Sabbath through the sacrament At the end of His mortal ministry and the beginning of His resurrected ministry both times our Savior took bread and wine and asked that we remember His body and blood 20 for as oft as ye do this ye will remember this hour that I was with you 21In the ordinance of the sacrament we witness unto God the Father that we are willing to take upon us the name of His Son and always remember Him and keep His commandments which He has given us that we may always have His Spirit to be with us 22As Amulek teaches we remember Him when we pray over our fields our flocks and our households and when we remember the needy the naked the sick and afflicted 23Finally sixth our Savior invites us to always remember Him as He always remembers us In the New World our resurrected Savior invited those present to come one by one to thrust their hands into His side and to feel the prints of the nails in His hands and in His feet 24The scriptures describe resurrection as every limb and joint shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame and even a hair of the head shall not be lost 25 That being so please consider how it is that our Savior s perfect resurrected body still bears the wounds in His side and the nail prints in His hands and feet 26At times in history mortal men have been executed by crucifixion But only our Savior Jesus Christ embraces us still carrying the marks of His pure love Only He fulfills the prophecy of being lifted up upon the cross that He might draw each of us by name to Him 27Our Savior declares Yea they may forget yet will I not forget thee Behold I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands 28He testifies I am he who was lifted up I am Jesus that was crucified I am the Son of God 29I humbly testify and pray that we will always remember Him in all times all things and all places we may be in 30 In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ amen 
Dear brothers and sisters when our son was in the Provo Missionary Training Center Sister Gong mailed fresh baked bread to him and his missionary companions Here are some of the missionary thank you notes Sister Gong received Sister Gong that bread was a taste of home Sister Gong all I can say is wow That bread is the best thing to enter my mouth since my mother s enchiladas But this is my favorite Sister Gong the bread was wonderful He then jokingly continued Keep me in mind if things don t work out between you and Mr Gong We love our missionaries each elder sister and senior couple We are eternally grateful to that special missionary who first brought the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to our family I gratefully testify that an eternal perspective of gospel conversion and temple covenants can help us see rich blessings in each generation of our forever families The first convert in our Gong family to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is our mother Jean Gong As a teenager in Honolulu Hawaii she listened she knew she was baptized and confirmed she is continuing in faith Faithful Church members helped my mother so that she had gospel friends Church callings and continued nourishment by God s good word In today s parlance each new convert young single adult those returning to Church activity and others bless generations when they become fellow Saints in the household of God 1One family who nurtured my mother was that of Gerrit de Jong Jr A linguist who loved the language of the heart and Spirit Grandpa de Jong tickled my little boy imagination by sayings like Blackberries when red are green Today speaking of electronic handheld devices I tell young friends Blackberries read in Church make green bishops blue My parents Walter and Jean Gong were married three times a Chinese ceremony for family an American ceremony for friends and a sacred ceremony in the house of the Lord for time and eternity Our Primary children sing I love to see the temple I m going there someday 2 Our youth pledge to receive the ordinances of the temple 3I recently stood in a house of the Lord with a worthy couple there to receive blessings by covenant I invited them to make their first honeymoon last 50 years then after 50 years to begin their second honeymoon I found myself looking with this beautiful couple into the temple mirrors one mirror on this side one mirror on that side Together the temple mirrors reflect back and forth images that stretch seemingly into eternity Temple mirrors of eternity remind us that each human being has divine nature and destiny that sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally 4 and that growing together in love and faithfulness we can give children roots and wings In temple mirrors of eternity I reflected on First Dragon Gong born a d 837 late Tang dynasty in southern China and the succeeding Gong family generations to my father our family s 32nd recorded generation My brother sister and I are in our family s 33rd generation my sons and their cousins the 34th generation our grandson the 35th recorded Gong family generation In temple mirrors of eternity I could not see a beginning or end of generations I then imagined not only a succession of generations but also a succession of family relationships In one direction I saw myself as son grandson great grandson back to First Dragon Gong In the mirrors in the other direction I saw myself as father grandfather great grandfather I could see my wife Susan as daughter granddaughter great granddaughter and in the other direction as mother grandmother great grandmother In temple mirrors of eternity I began to understand my wife and myself as children of our parents and parents to our children as grandchildren of our grandparents and grandparents to our grandchildren Mortality s great lessons distill upon our souls as we learn and teach in eternal roles including child and parent parent and child Scripture describes our Savior as the Father and the Son 5 Having dwelt in flesh and subjected the flesh to the will of the Father our Savior knows how to succor us His people in our pains afflictions temptations sicknesses even death 6 Having descended below all things 7 our Savior can bear our griefs and carry our sorrows He was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities with our Savior s stripes we are healed 8From the councils in heaven our Savior sought only to do His Father s will This pattern of Father and Son can help explain the paradox He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it 9 The world pursues enlightened self interest Yet the power is not in us to save ourselves But it is in Him Infinite and eternal 10 only our Savior s Atonement transcends time and space to swallow up death anger bitterness unfairness loneliness and heartbreak Sometimes things go wrong even though we have done our very best A Lamb innocent and pure our Savior weeps with and for us When we always remember Him 11 He can stand with us at all times and in all things and in all places that we may be in 12 His faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death 13 In drawing us to Him our Savior also draws us to our Father in Heaven While some things are imperfect on earth we can trust our Heavenly Father to complete redemption s grand design where justice love and mercy meet in harmony divine 14A miracle of the images we discern in temple mirrors of eternity is that they we can change When Jean and Walter Gong entered the new and everlasting covenant they opened the way for ancestors such as First Dragon Gong to be sealed and for posterity to be born in the covenant Please remember as we reach out to each sister or brother we bless generations The world is in commotion 15 but in His only true and living Church 16 there is faith and no fear In the words of the Apostle Paul I also solemnly testify For I am persuaded that neither death nor life Nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord 17I humbly witness God lives He shall wipe away all tears from our eyes 18 except the tears of joy when we see through temple mirrors of eternity and find ourselves home pure and clean our family generations sealed by priesthood authority in love to shout Hosanna hosanna hosanna In the name of Jesus Christ amen
